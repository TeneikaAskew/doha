He also provided explanations for all SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant was born in 1951, in the PRC, and he moved to the United States as a 39-year old student in February 1991 (GE 2B at 2, 6, Tr. 77, 96-97, 120). He used all of his savings to come to the United States (Tr. 79). Applicant\u2019s wife and his son, Mr. T, moved to the United States six months later (GE2 B at 2-3, Tr. 98).

Cave, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence) because of frequent, non-casual contacts with his mother, father-in-law and \none brother, who live in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Although his security \nclearance is denied; recommend he receive access to sensitive, unclassified \ninformation as necessary for his non-Department of Defense public trust position. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 7, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (EPSQ \n86).1 On February 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \n \n1There is no allegation of falsification of Applicant\u2019s EPSQ 86.   \n \n2Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 22. 2008, is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 27, 2008, Applicant provided an exceptionally thorough response to \nthe SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On May 22, \n2008, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On May 27, 2008, the \ncase was assigned to an Administrative Judge. On June 10, 2008, the case was \ntransferred to another Administrative Judge, and on July 18, 2008, the case was \ntransferred to me. \n \nThe notice of hearing was issued on August 5, 2008, for a hearing which was \nheld on August 27, 2008, in Arlington, Virginia. The transcript was received on \nSeptember 4, 2008. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence \n(Tr. 16). Applicant did not object, and they were admitted into evidence (Tr. 16, GE 1, \n2). I admitted the SOR as GE 5, and the SOR response as GE 6 (Tr. 7-10). Applicant\u2019s \nSOR response has Tabs A through E, and subparts to the various tabs. I have retained \nApplicant\u2019s tab designations.  Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, a photocopy \nof his passport. Department Counsel did not object, and I admitted AE A into evidence \n(Tr. 94).  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and provided supporting documents to show detail \nand context for those facts (Tr. 16-17; Ex. I to VI\u2014listed in Request for Administrative \nNotice at 5). Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice (Tr. 17). I agreed \nto take administrative notice of the facts in the Request for Administrative Notice, and \nasked Department Counsel to provide after the hearing any additional facts in Ex. I to VI \nto which he was seeking administrative notice (Tr. 17-18). Department Counsel declined \nto provide additional facts, but requested administrative notice of the entire exhibit, \nincluding attachments (Tr. 18). I overruled Department Counsel\u2019s request, and took \nadministrative notice of the top five pages of GE 3 (Tr. 19).   \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued \nafter Sep. 1, 2006. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Exhibits I to VI are attached \nto GE 3 to ensure the administrative record is complete. See the PRC section of the \nFindings of Fact of this decision, infra, for the facts accepted by administrative notice. \n \nFindings of Fact4 \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted most of the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j in his response to the SOR. He also provided explanations for all SOR \nallegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant was born in 1951, in the PRC, and he moved to the United States as a \n39-year old student in February 1991 (GE 2B at 2, 6, Tr. 77, 96-97, 120). He used all of \nhis savings to come to the United States (Tr. 79). Applicant\u2019s wife and his son, Mr. T, \nmoved to the United States six months later (GE2 B at 2-3, Tr. 98). He is now 57 years \nold and has spent about two thirds of his lifetime in PRC (Tr. 77). Applicant married in \n1979 (Tr. 78, 97). When he arrived in the United States, it was on a student visa (Tr. \n120). Then he received a work visa about two years later (Tr. 120-121). He received a \ngreen card in 1999 (Tr. 120). Applicant, his wife, and his son MT became naturalized \nU.S. citizens in 2005 (GE2 B at 2, Tr. 97). When Applicant received U.S. citizenship, he \nautomatically lost his PRC citizenship (Tr. 71). Applicant was unhappy with the PRC \ngovernment because he was taken from an excellent high school and forced under a \nCultural Revolution policy to do agricultural work as a 14-year old (Tr. 58, 77). He \nworked on farms from 1968 to 1979 (Tr. 99). In the PRC he earned a bachelors degree \nin tourism management in 1990 (Tr. 99). He has never served in the PRC military (Tr. \n100). He was never a member of the PRC communist party (Tr. 102). After he arrived in \nthe United States, he earned two MBA degrees, one in accounting and one in \ninformation management (Tr. 81, 98). In the United States people have the freedom to \nchoose their work and how they want to live (Tr. 58-59). Applicant loves the United \nStates and would not jeopardize his U.S. opportunities to succeed and live in freedom \n(Tr. 59). Applicant and Mr. T are loyal to the United States (Tr. 60). \n \n \n4 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. Unless stated \notherwise, the source for the facts in this section is Applicant\u2019s SOR Response. Applicant provided a \ntable, which included specific details regarding his contacts with family members living in the PRC. See \nGE 2 at I29 through I32 (Tr. 130-131). \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nMT was born in the PRC and moved to the United States when he was ten years \nold (GE2 B at 2-3, Tr. 54, 61). After leaving PRC as a boy, MT returned to PRC on \nabout five occasions to visit relatives, family and friends (Tr. 61). MT\u2019s first trip in 1999 \nwas with his parents and the last two were by himself (Tr. 62). MT\u2019s most recent trip to \nPRC was in January 2008 (Tr. 63).5 MT stayed in PRC for about 10 days (Tr. 63). MT, \nwho is now 26 years old, earned a bachelors degree and has begun classes at a U.S. \nuniversity for his masters degree in computer science with applications towards medical \nresearch (GE2 B at 3, Tr. 53-54, 63). MT has cerebral palsy (Tr. 54-55). Shortly after \nMT arrived in the United States, MT\u2019s school district in the United States took the \ninitiative and helped treat and accommodate his cerebral palsy, which would not have \noccurred in the PRC (Tr. 54-57). Applicant and MT were grateful to the United States \nbecause of the treatment for the cerebral palsy (Tr. 56). Each person in the United \nStates is valued and prized as an individual, which is a positive attribute not present in \nthe PRC (Tr. 57).  \n \nApplicant has been employed by a defense contactor for almost seven years, \nand is currently a Senior Information Technology Analyst (GE2 B at 3). His annual \nsalary is $93,000 with a 10% 401K plan (GE2 B at 4, Tr. 88). One of his strong assets is \nas a software designer (GE2 B at 4). His company has provided various training \nopportunities to Applicant (GE2 B at 4). He received eight awards including a company \ntop-level Production Award and an agency certificate of appreciation (GE2 B at 4; D9). \nHe has developed excellent relationships with managers, colleagues and customers \n(GE2 B at 4; D10).     \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother was born in 1918 (GE2 B at 6, D2). She is a citizen and \nresident of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant telephones her approximately once a week \n(Tr. 117). His mother is retired from employment in a chemical factory and is in poor \nhealth (GE2 B at 2, 6, 7). She had a heart attack in 2000 and has kidney problems, high \nblood pressure, high cholesterol, and has difficulty walking (GE2 B at 7). In 2002 she \nhad a pacemaker installed to regulate her heart rate (Tr. 89).  \n \nApplicant provides some financial remuneration to his mother (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Over \nthe last seven years, Applicant has given her about $3,000 (GE2 B at 7, Tr. 89). He \ngave his mother $415 as a gift for her 90th birthday (GE2 D1). He also gave her $1,000 \nin 2002 to purchase furniture (Tr. 90). The funds were provided out of love, and \nbecause she requires financial \u201csupport\u201d (Tr. 90-91). She owns a condo, and receives a \npension (Tr. 91). Applicant\u2019s financial gifts are unnecessary for her to sustain herself. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased (Tr. 110). Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is also \ndeceased (Tr. 110).  Applicant\u2019s spouse does not provide support to her parents (Tr. \n110). \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.c). His \nfather-in-law is 87 years old and suffers from prostate cancer and diabetes (GE2 B at \n7). He is also beginning to show signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (GE2 B at 7). He has \n \n5 In addition to visiting family, Mr. T visited one of Applicant\u2019s middle school teachers, who \nremained a friend of Applicant\u2019s parents (Tr. 64).  \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nbeen retired from a medicine factory for 25 years (GE2 B at 7). Each time Applicant \nvisits China, he visits his father-in-law two or three times (GE2 B at 7). Applicant also \ntelephones his father-in-law several times a year on his birthday and traditional Chinese \nholidays (GE2 B at 8). Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law takes care of his father-in-law (GE2 B \nat 7).  \n \nApplicant provides some financial assistance to his father-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He \nand his spouse have given his father-in-law about $2,000 over the last seven years \n(GE2 B at 8). He gave his father-in-law $276 for his 87th birthday (GE2 D1). The money \nhe provided over the last seven years is a gift, and is designed to improve his father-in-\nlaw\u2019s living conditions (GE2 B at 7). However, because of his father-in-law\u2019s pension, he \nis financially independent (GE2 B at 7, 8). \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother, MJ, is 51 years old, and holds a U.S. green card (GE2 B at 8; \nTr. 91). MJ is still a citizen of the PRC (Tr. 111). MJ owns a house in the United States, \nand his wife is a U.S. citizen (GE2 B at 8, 10; Tr. 91). They returned to the United States \non March 21, 2008, and they intend to remain in the United States (GE2 B at 8; Tr. 91-\n92, 113-114).  See SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother, MZ, is 57 years old and runs a business with his wife in the \nPRC (GE2 B at 8). MZ does not have any connection to the PRC government (GE2 B at \n8). Applicant occasionally meets with MZ when he visits MZ in PRC (GE2 B at 9). He \ntelephones MZ usually once a month to check on his mother\u2019s health (GE2 B at 9, Tr. \n118). See SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, HA, is 59 years old and lives in PRC (GE2 B at 9; Tr. 112-114). \nShe retired from a factory job ten years ago (GE2 B at 9). HA is physically weak from \nbreast cancer, and seldom leaves her home (GE2 B at 9). Applicant has a few \nconversations each year with HA (GE2 B at 9, Tr. 118-119). See SOR \u00b6 1.f.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, HI, is 56 years old and lives in PRC (GE2 B at 9). She retired \nfive years ago from a post office job (GE2 B at 9; Tr. 112-114). Applicant communicates \nwith HI 6-7 times each year by telephone for greetings and discussion of family affairs \n(GE2 B at 9, Tr. 118-119). See SOR \u00b6 1.f.   \n \nApplicant has three sisters-in-law who are citizens and residents of the PRC \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g; GE2 B at 10, Tr. 114-115).  As indicated previously, one other sister-in-law \nis a U.S. citizen living in the United States (GE2 B at 10). The three sisters-in-law, ZY, \nZM and HD are 66 years old, 60 years old, and 50 years old, respectively (GE2 B at \n10). Applicant has not had any contact with ZY for 20 years (GE2 B at 10). ZM retired \nfrom her factory job more than 10 years ago, and Applicant visits ZM exclusively when \nhe visits his father-in-law (GE2 B at 10). HD retired from her farm job, and is assisting \nMZ in his business (GE2 B at 10).  Applicant has met HD a few times when he visits his \nmother (GE2 B at 10). \n \nApplicant has four brothers-in-law who are citizens and residents of the PRC \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h).  All of his brothers-in-law are retired (GE2 B at 11, Tr. 116).  Applicant and \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nhis wife do not telephone his brothers-in-law (Tr. 119). However, they might visit them \nwhen they go to the PRC (Tr. 119). \n      \nApplicant does not currently have any financial assets in the PRC (GE2 B at 2). \nOn April 8, 2007, Applicant opened a bank account in a bank located in the PRC (SOR \n\u00b6 1.i) (Tr. 67, 107). He deposited 100,000 Yuan (40,000 Yuan from his mother and \n60,000 Yuan (about $8,900) from Applicant) when he opened the account (GE2 D1). \nApplicant received about $600 in interest while the PRC account was open (GE2 D1, Tr. \n69). On February 29, 2008, Applicant closed this bank account because he did not want \nto raise a security concern (GE2 D1, Tr. 69).  \n \nApplicant has financial assets in the United States totaling about $600,000 (GE2 \nB at 3). He and his spouse purchased a house in 1999, where they currently reside, \nwhich is worth approximately $500,000 (GE2 B at 3, Tr. 79, 88). He has a 401K account \nwith a balance of $163,000 (GE2 B at 3, Tr. 79, 88). He and his spouse have several \nother accounts (GE2 B at 3). He and his wife have life insurance policies for $150,000 \nand $100,000, respectively (GE2 B at 3, Tr. 79). When he retires, he anticipates \nreceiving $1,500 monthly from social security (GE2 B at 3). Applicant said if he moved \nback to PRC, he would not receive social security or Medicare benefits from the U.S. \ngovernment (Tr. 80).6 \n \nApplicant traveled to PRC in November 1999, July 2000, October 2001, \nDecember 2002, March 2005, April 2006, April 2007, and February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.j; \nGE2 B at 11; Tr. 92). He stayed in PRC on each occasion for two to three weeks (GE2 \nB at 12). He went to PRC in February 2008 to close his bank account, and the travel \nwas reported to his company security officer (GE2 B at 12). He traveled to PRC to visit \nhis mother. He explained, \u201cIn recent years, I have saved all my vacation days to visit \nmother because I realize every visit may be the last.\u201d (GE2 B at 12, Tr. 103-107). He \nalso visited his father-in-law when he went to PRC (GE2 B at 12, Tr. 103-107). When he \nwent to PRC he often visited other family members, such as his brothers, sisters and in-\nlaws (Tr. 105-107). In the future, he plans to visit his mother in the PRC \u201cif it\u2019s allowed\u201d \n(Tr. 108-109). Under traditional Chinese culture, as oldest son, Applicant has a moral \n(but not a legal) obligation to ensure that his mother receives care and support (Tr. \n109). Applicant has never been contacted by anyone interested in obtaining any special \ninformation about his employment (GE2 B at 12). If he was contacted for such \ninformation, he would report it to security officials (GE2 B at 12). \n \nApplicant reiterated in his SOR response: \n \nit is highly unlikely that I would jeopardize my relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S. because of my relationship with [his relative in PRC]. Just in case \nsuch conflict of interest emerges in the future, my deep and longstanding \n \n6 Actually, Applicant would be able to receive Social Security benefits if he returned to PRC. See \nSocial Security Online. Available at: http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10137.html#what. However, he would not \nbe able to receive his Medicare benefits overseas. See U.S. Department of State website. Available at \nhttp://travel.state.gov/travel/living/living_1234.html#medicare. \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nrelationships and loyalties to the United States will enable me to resolve it \nin favor of the U.S. interests. \n \n(GE2 B at 8, 9, 10). Applicant traveled to PRC in February 2008 using his U.S. passport \n(Tr. 72, AE A).  He received a briefing from his security officer before going to the PRC \nin 2008 (Tr. 131-132). Applicant turned in his Chinese passport (GE2 B at 6, Tr. 70-71). \nThe company security officer observed the destruction of the PRC passport (Tr. 75-76). \nApplicant prefers the U.S. culture over that of the PRC (Tr. 81).  His son, Mr. T, is \nAmericanized and would not fit into PRC culture (Tr. 81). Freedom of speech, especially \nthe right to dissent, is especially important to Applicant, and this right is notably absent \nin the PRC (Tr. 82).  Moreover, Applicant was loyal to the United States because he \nwas always well-treated by Americans, even when he was just a dishwasher, doing his \nfirst American job (Tr. 82-83). Americans, including police officers, and employers, have \nalways been fair and kind to Applicant (Tr. 83-84).  Americans show dignity and respect \nfor others, and recognize and value his hard work (Tr. 85). The government spent tax \ndollars to provide medical assistance for his son, Mr. T, when Mr. T was a child, even \nthough Applicant was a student and did not have health insurance (Tr. 85-86). Applicant \nis willing to support and protect American society and the United States (Tr. 85).  \nApplicant has made the United States his adopted homeland (Tr. 87). \n \nRecommendations \n \n \nA project manager for Applicant\u2019s employer, AA, has been employed by the \ncontractor for ten years. AA has known Applicant in a professional, work environment \nfor six years (Tr. 24, 29). AA has supervised and evaluated Applicant for the last five \nyears (Tr. 25, 29-30). AA does not hold a security clearance (Tr. 31). Applicant obtains \nrequirements and then designs and generates software to meet those requirements (Tr. \n25). He has a very strong work ethic (Tr. 25). He interacts well with others (Tr. 25-26). \nHe is an excellent communicator, and strives to meet users\u2019 needs (Tr. 26). He is very \nreliable, trustworthy, truthful and honest (Tr. 26, 28). He has a good reputation for \nintegrity (Tr. 28). Applicant\u2019s current position does not require a clearance; however, he \ndoes have access to private, personal information (Tr. 27). He was cleared with a \nNational Agency Check to work with sensitive, privacy-protected information (Tr. 31).7 \nHis current position requires him to be cleared to hold a \u201cpublic trust\u201d position (Tr. 33).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague, BB, has worked for the same contractor as Applicant for \nsix years. BB has known Applicant for eight years on a professional, work-related basis \n(Tr. 37-39, 44, 48). BB has supervised Applicant on some projects (Tr. 49). BB \nrecommended that the contractor hire Applicant (Tr. 40). BB and Applicant are now \npeers or equals as employees (Tr. 49). BB has worked closely with Applicant and \nlauded his conscientiousness, reliability, honesty, integrity, loyalty and diligence (Tr. 41-\n42). BB described Applicant\u2019s relationship to the PRC and to the United States as \nfollows, \u201che thinks of China as his mother and the United States as his mother-in-law, so \nthe \u2013 he has an interest in both countries, but \u2013 the United States is now . . . his new \n \n7Applicant said he held a public trust clearance, which was suspended after he applied for a \nsecret clearance. After six weeks he was reinstated to the company (Tr. 133-135). \n    \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nmother\u201d (Tr. 46, 49).8 Applicant\u2019s U.S. citizenship was a very exciting time for him and a \ngreat milestone (Tr. 46). Applicant socializes with other PRC immigrants in the office \nwho have security clearance (Tr. 47). BB recommends approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance (Tr. 47).   \n    \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China \n \nChina has powerful military forces, including strategic nuclear missiles. China is \ngeographically vast, and has a population of over a billion people. It has significant \nresources, and an economy that in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. \nChina aggressively competes with the United States in many areas. PRC\u2019s competitive \nrelationship with the United States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to family members living in the PRC.   \n \nIn China reported human rights problems include suppression of political dissent, \narbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture and mistreatment of prisoners. \nThe PRC also monitors communications devices, such as telephone, telefax, and \ninternet. \n \nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human \nrights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention, \nforced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment. \n \n \nChina actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information \nabout the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a \nglobal power; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim and \nAsia; and (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China desires \nfor economic growth. China\u2019s active intelligence gathering programs focus on sensitive \nand protected U.S. technologies. \u201cChina\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities [are] \nthe leading threat to the security of U.S. technology.\u201d Department Counsel\u2019s summary at \n2. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \n \n8 Applicant explained that he adopted the United States as his homeland, but he wanted the PRC \nand United States to be friends, and did not want anything bad to happen between the two countries (Tr. \n128-129).  He wanted PRC to have a good reputation in the United States (Tr. 129).   \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.9 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).10 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \n \n9 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n10\u201fThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n[and] \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \n \n*  *  * \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nApplicant traveled to PRC in November 1999, July 2000, October 2001, \nDecember 2002, March 2005, April 2006, April 2007, and February 2008. He frequently \ncommunicates with his mother, father-in-law, and brother (MZ), who are all residents \nand citizens of PRC. When he visits the PRC, he frequently visits these three family \nmembers who reside there. He has infrequent communications with other family \nmembers living in the PRC. From April 2007 to February 2008, he had a financial \naccount in a PRC bank with the equivalent of several thousand dollars in this account. \nOver the last several years, he provided several thousand dollars in gifts to his mother, \nand several hundred dollars in gifts to his father-in-law.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated, \ncompetitive relationship of PRC with the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith his family in PRC does not pose a security risk and he is not in a position to be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his family members.11 With \n \n11 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in PRC. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating \nan applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents \nand siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR Case No. 06-\n17164 at 15 (A.J. Oct. 23, 2007) (listing 23 consecutive cases involving U.S. citizens with Iranian \nconnections whose clearances were denied). The Appeal Board has articulated a \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d because of the PRC\u2019s hostility to the United States. ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard and reversing grant of clearance in \ncase involving family members living in the PRC). For example in ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. May 9, 2008), the Appeal Board stated, \u201cGiven the PRC\u2019s interest in U.S. intelligence, Applicant\u2019s \nforeign relatives pose a real, rather than merely theoretical, risk that Applicant could be targeted for \nmanipulation or induced into compromising classified information.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                                                                            \nits mixed human rights record, and other political, economic and military rivalry with the \nUnited States, it is conceivable that PRC would target any citizen in an attempt to gather \nvaluable information from the United States. \n \nThere is evidence that PRC intelligence operatives seek classified or economic \ninformation from U.S. businesses and/or government agencies, Applicant\u2019s connections \nto his mother, his father-in-law and his brother (MZ) create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause these relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his \ndesire to help these three relatives living in the PRC by providing sensitive or classified \ninformation.    \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nmother, his father-in-law and his brother (MZ), his relationships with them, and his travel \nto PRC in 1999 to 2007 to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation. Between April 2007 and February 2008, he had a substantial financial \ninterest in an account in a bank located in the PRC, which could also subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and \n7(f) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(App. Bd. May 9, 2008) the Appeal Board described what facts supported reversal of the Administrative \nJudge\u2019s decision to grant that Applicant with connections to PRC a clearance: \n \nThe fact that Applicant lives with a PRC citizen, her husband; that her husband maintains \ncontact with his own father who is a citizen and resident of the PRC; that Applicant\u2019s \nbrother is a citizen and resident of the PRC; that Applicant speaks with her brother over \nthe telephone \u201cseveral times a year;\u201d that the PRC targets U.S. citizens of PRC ancestry \nfor intelligence gathering purposes; and that the PRC monitors telephone and other \ncommunications of its citizens constitute significant record evidence of security significant \nforeign contacts and interest. As such, Applicant\u2019s evidence as to her good job \nperformance and her ties to the U.S. are not sufficient to mitigate those concerns. It is not \nto question Applicant\u2019s patriotism to acknowledge that the record in her case raises the \nreasonable concern that she could be placed in a position of having to choose between \nher ties to the U.S. and her obligations to her foreign family members. The evidence \nwhich Applicant has provided is not sufficient to mitigate the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns. The Board holds that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable on this \nrecord.  \n \nSee also ADP Case No. 05-17812 (App. Bd. June 11, 2007); ISCR Case No. 05-10467 (App. Bd.

His brothers-in-law, his sisters-in-law, and his \nsisters, who are residents of PRC and citizens of PRC are not security concerns. \nSimilarly his brother and sister-in-law who recently moved to the United States are not \nsecurity concerns. \u201cIt is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of [these relatives] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His infrequent \ncontacts and not particularly close relationship with these relatives have a low potential \nof forcing him to choose between the United States and the PRC. He met his burden of \nshowing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with these relatives] could create \na risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  His contacts and communications with these \nrelatives are so casual and infrequent as to not create a risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.   \n \nThere is no evidence that these relatives have been political activists, challenging \nthe policies of the PRC Government. There is no evidence these relatives currently \nwork for or have ever worked for the PRC Government or military or any news media. \nThere is no evidence that terrorists or the PRC Government have approached or \nthreatened Applicant or these relatives for any reason. There is no evidence that these \nfamily members living in PRC currently engage in activities which would bring attention \nto them or that they or other PRC elements are even aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As \nsuch, there is a reduced possibility that these relatives would be targets for coercion or \nexploitation.  But see n. 11, infra (discussing limited weight that can be given to such \ninformation). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with the United States weighs against a security \nconcern for these relationships. Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d His spouse and son are U.S. citizens, and all \nreside in the United States. They have lived in the United States since 1991 and are \nfully inculcated with U.S. values. He attended U.S. schools for two MBAs. He worked for \ngovernment contractors for seven years with great distinction.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) fully applies to the PRC bank account that was closed in February \n2008. SOR \u00b6 1.i is mitigated.    \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to his mother, his father- \nin-law, or his brother (MZ). He provides financial gifts to his mother and his father-in-\nlaw. These gifts are one manifestation of the strong regard and emotional bond he has \nfor these relatives. He recognizes that he has a moral responsibility to care for his \nmother because he is her eldest son. His brother (MZ) is the eldest brother located in \nthe PRC and because of MZ\u2019s location assists Applicant in accomplishment of this \nfamilial responsibility. Although Applicant\u2019s close relationship with these family members \nis an important positive reflection of his character, the same close relationships raise \nsecurity concerns for possible foreign influence.     \n \nApplicant deserves some credit because of the reduced possibility that the PRC \nwill exploit his mother, his father-in-law or his brother (MZ) because of the low profile \nthey have in PRC society. However, these factors are insufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns because of his close relationship with them, his frequent contacts with them, \nand because of the nature of the PRC Government and its complicated, and sometimes \ncontentious relationship to the United States.

Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd.

The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning PRC must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in PRC, as well as the dangers existing in PRC.13 PRC is a known \ncollector of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic information.  In ISCR Case No. 06-\n24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative \njudge\u2019s decision to grant a PRC Applicant\u2019s clearance because he gave too much \nweight to the Applicant\u2019s \u201cstrong ties to the U.S.\u201d and determined there was insufficient \nevidentiary support for the conclusion that he \u201ccan be trusted to resolve any conflict of \ninterest . . . in favor of the U.S.\u201d The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 06-24575 said he \n                                                                                                                                             \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005))  and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept. \n \n13 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nwould not act against the U.S. if faced with the choice. However, the Appeal Board \ngives such promises little weight in their de novo review of the evidence,14 stating: \n \nAn Applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he would do in the future is of \nrelatively little weight, given the record in this case. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09053 at (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention \nabout what he or she might do in the future under some hypothetical set of \ncircumstances is merely a statement of intention that is not entitled to \nmuch weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted \nin a similar manner in the past under similar circumstances.\u201d) \n \nId. at 4. See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (criticizing the \nadministrative judge\u2019s reliance on PRC-Applicant\u2019s promise to choose the U.S. over \nPRC should a conflict arise, and reversing the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a \nclearance).  \n    \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of his access to classified \ninformation. Applicant has lived in the United States since 1991 (except for his visits to \nthe PRC). He became a U.S. citizen in 2005. His wife and son are U.S. citizens. He is \nan excellent employee and U.S. citizen. He compellingly explained why his loyalty is to \nthe United States, rather than to the PRC. He thoroughly developed the evidence \nshowing his connections to the United States and to the PRC. I found his statements to \nbe honest, candid and credible. He provided corroborating statements concerning his \nloyalty and trustworthiness. He provided recommendations of employers, friends, and/or \na family member supporting his application for a security clearance.  \n \n \n \n14 The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined \nthe phrase \"de novo determination\": \n \n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent \ndetermination of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the \nsame controversy. Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, \n23 [(1974)], the Court had occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \n\"unfettered by any prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim \nthat the [agency's] determination is supported by substantial evidence.\" And, in United \nStates v. First City National Bank, 386 U.S. 361, 368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \n\"review de novo\" means \"that the court should make an independent determination of the \nissues\" and should \"not . . .  give any special weight to the [prior] determination of\" the \nadministrative agency.  \n \n(internal footnotes omitted). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2007), the Appeal Board \ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, \nand then decided the case itself. Judge White\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility \ndeterminations and ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the \njudge who makes witness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-\n11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to \nreverse hearing-level judicial decisions). \n \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nA Guideline B decision concerning the PRC must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in PRC, as well as the dangers existing in PRC.15 The PRC is a \ndiplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both \ncountries have mutual interests. For example, the PRC is a key partner in the search for \npeace and resolution of problems with North Korea. China\u2019s relationship with the United \nStates has significantly changed over the decades and is likely to change again in the \nfuture. China was an important U.S. ally in World War II, and then an enemy of the \nUnited States during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. China has a mixed to poor human \nrights record. The PRC is one of the most aggressive nations in the collection of U.S. \nintelligence and sensitive economic information.  \n   \nOne element increasing the foreign influence security concern was Applicant\u2019s \ntravel to the PRC seven times between 1999 and April 2007. His most recent trip to \nPRC in February 2008 was with the permission of his U.S. corporate employers, and \nwas designed to close his PRC bank account. His most recent trip tends to mitigate \nsome of the security concerns.    \n \nAn important element in the foreign influence analysis is that he lived in the PRC \nfrom 1951 until 1991, which is approximately two thirds of his life.  He did not become a \nU.S. citizen until relatively recently in 2005.  \n \nApplicant has significant ties to his mother, his father-in-law, and his brother \n(MZ). These three relatives are citizens of and live in the PRC. He has frequent \ntelephone contact with and frequently visits these relatives. His gifts to his mother and \nfather-in-law demonstrate his close ties of affection to them. There is a possibility \nApplicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates.  \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of his connections to the PRC, and to the United \nStates, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of fully mitigating the foreign \ninfluence security concern.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d16 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.  \nHowever, I conclude the government should not revoke his access to sensitive \ninformation based on his public trust position. It is extremely unlikely that the PRC would \ntarget anyone\u2019s relatives to gain access to sensitive, but unclassified information.   \n \n \n15 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n16See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

He also has a 22-year-old daughter about whom he only learned recently, who lives independently without financial effect on his family. Applicant\u2019s wife has been unable to work since December 2006, when she suffered a work-related injury. She was injured again in an automobile accident in September 2007. They are still awaiting financial compensation from both incidents, although she does receive workers\u2019 compensation. (GE 4 at 14;AE A at tab 23; Tr. at 45-46.) Her loss of income caused their monthly expenses to exceed their income by approximately $1,000 per month, an amount that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has been giving to them for more than six months.

He falsified\ninformation about his recent drug use on his security clearance application. Based upon\nthorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86), on\nNovember 29, 2006. On January 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns\nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nMay 30, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 4, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 12, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on February 19, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 26, 2008, and DOHA assigned the case\nto me on February 28, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 11, 2008, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on March 26, 2008. An electronic copy of the notice was delivered to\nApplicant on March 11, 2008 via email, and he acknowledged receiving it 15 days\npreviously during the hearing. (Tr. at 9.) The government offered exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A (a bound volume with 27 separate tabs and\nexhibits), and AE B (a single page inserted in the inside front-cover pocket of AE A),\nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non April 14, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married with\ntwo sons, ages 17 and 14. He also has a 22-year-old daughter about whom he only\nlearned recently, who lives independently without financial effect on his family.\nApplicant\u2019s wife has been unable to work since December 2006, when she suffered a\nwork-related injury. She was injured again in an automobile accident in September\n2007. They are still awaiting financial compensation from both incidents, although she\ndoes receive workers\u2019 compensation. (GE 4 at 14;AE A at tab 23; Tr. at 45-46.) Her loss\nof income caused their monthly expenses to exceed their income by approximately\n$1,000 per month, an amount that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has been giving to them for\nmore than six months. They also borrowed $14,000 from his parents to pay some older\nbills, and are repaying that debt at a rate of $410 per month.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 12, 2008, Applicant admitted to the\ntruth of each SOR allegation. During his testimony, he stated that he has been working\nto repay his delinquent debts and thought that some of them may have been repaid,\nalthough he could not find documentation to substantiate those payments. His most\nrecent credit bureau report (CBR) does not contain some of the SOR-listed debts that\nwere reflected in earlier reports. The 18 delinquent debts listed in the SOR, to which\nApplicant formally admitted, total $36,680, and range from 1989 to 2006. (GE 3.)\nApplicant does not dispute owing the three state tax debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.c, and testified that he believes the total owed is now approximately $1,700.\n(Tr. at 37, 51-52.) During the hearing, Applicant disputed owing both the $947 tax debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and the separate $1,600 tax debt to the same state alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Although both debts are listed on pages 3 and 4 of GE 3, it is apparent that\nthe $1,600 tax lien filed in 1995 was simply an updated claim from the same originally\ndisputed smaller claim filed in 1989. This claim arose when Applicant earned some\noutside income in that state while serving in the Navy, and the state taxed his entire\n\n3\nreported federal income including his military pay on which he paid taxes in his home\nstate. Applicant neither lived nor worked in the state after leaving the Navy in 1990, and\nwould not have incurred a separate tax liability in 1995. Although he originally disputed\nthe amount owed, he never followed through and believes it is now too late to dispute\nthe issue. He has made no effort to resolve this debt to date, because he cannot afford\nto pay it now. (Tr. at 37-38, 52-54.)\nApplicant entered into an Offer in Compromise agreement with the Federal\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) to resolve what was originally more than $17,000 in\ndelinquent tax debt. As of March 13, 2008, he had paid $5,317 toward the negotiated\n$10,332 settlement, and still owed $5,015 toward which he pays between $440 and\n$530 per month. The IRS considers him to be in good standing on the agreement. This\nis the debt alleged in the amount of $11,235 in SOR \u00b6 1.f, which was based on the\namount filed with the federal tax lien in October 2006. Applicant also anticipates that his\ntax refund of approximately $1,700 and the $1,800 federal tax rebate will be kept by the\nIRS and applied to this debt, allowing him to finish paying it with only three or four\nadditional monthly payments. (GE 3 at 4;GE 4 at 11; AE A at tab 15; Tr. at 38, 54-57.)\nApplicant was originally unsure whether the two debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g\n($315) and 1.h ($171) had been paid. These outstanding balances were reported in GE\n3 (CBR dated Feb. 15, 2007) at pages 5 and 7. However, they do not appear in GE 5\n(CBR dated Feb. 26, 2008), and are listed as closed collection accounts with no\nbalance shown in AE A at tab 22, page 10 (CBR dated Mar. 17, 2008). He had no proof\nof having made payment and has not contacted the creditors, and later testified that he\nthought the \u00b6 1.h debt had not been paid, and confirmed that it is listed with a $171\nbalance due on page 3 of AE A at tab 22. (Tr. at 38-39, 57-59.) \nApplicant also testified that he believed the two debts, to the same creditor, listed\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($135) and 1.j ($159) have been paid. These debts were listed on page 6\nof GE 3, but do not appear on any of Applicant\u2019s subsequent CBRs (GE 5 and AE A at\ntab 22). However, he did not keep any record of the payments. (Tr. at 39, 59.) He\nadmitted still owing th $14,746 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.k. This was a credit card balance\non a company credit card issued to him by a former employer. When he was\nunexpectedly laid off, he used the card for personal expenses and has not made any\npayments toward this debt. Although it has been dropped from his 2008 CBRs due to\nthe age of the debt, Applicant agreed that he still owes it and intends to pay it when he\ncan. (GE 3 at 6; Tr. at 39-40, 59-60.)\nApplicant also admits owing the $740 delinquent utility bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l.\nHe has not contacted this creditor because he has not had sufficient funds to repay the\ndebt. (GE 3 at 7; AE A tab 22 at 2; Tr. at 40; 60.) He believed that the debts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m ($118), and 1.n. ($116) have been paid. He did not have documentation to\nsupport that, except that neither debt appears on either of the 2008 CBRs in the record.\n(Tr. at 40, 60-61.) He formerly tried, and plans to again dispute the amount claimed by\nthe creditor ($3,920) for the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. He believes a\nsignificant portion of that amount should have been paid by a former health insurance\n\n4\nprogram, however it became due in June 2002 and was reported delinquent in August\n2002. Applicant reported on his SF 86 that he was unemployed from September 2001\nuntil September 2002, and did not explain what insurance coverage he would have\nbeen eligible for. (GE 3 at 8; GE 5 at 2; GE 2 at 17; Tr. at 40, 61-64.)\nApplicant admitted owing the $269 medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.p. He thought\nthat the two debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q ($453) and 1.r ($276) may have been included in\nan $1,800 payment he made to a debt collector in September 2007. He had no\ndocumentation to substantiate this, however, and both debts were still reported to be\noutstanding on his February and March 2008 CBRs. (AE A at tabs 21, and 22 at 11-12;\nGE 5 at 2; Tr. at 64-66.) \nIn sum, Applicant still owes at least 12 of the SOR-listed delinquent debts with an\noutstanding balance in excess of $28,600. He has been making $290 monthly\npayments toward a delinquent tax debt in his present state that is not listed in the SOR.\nThe outstanding balance on this debt is down to $610. (AE A at tab 21.) He also makes\nabout $500 in monthly payments toward his federal tax Offer in Compromise. In order to\nmake those payments and pay some of his other bills, he has borrowed $14,000 from\nhis father and still borrows $1,000 per month from his mother-in-law. He has decided\nnot to file for bankruptcy since many of these debts arose in part due to his drug and\nalcohol addiction and making his creditors whole is important to him as part of his\nrecovery program. (Tr. at 35-36, 74-76.)\nApplicant stopped drinking alcohol in November 2002 as part of a court-ordered\ntreatment program following a DUI arrest. From 1990 until 2002, he used marijuana on\na daily basis. Following the treatment program, he continued to use marijuana, but on a\nless frequent \u201crecreational\u201d basis. He stopped using marijuana in late November 2006.\nIn response to question 24 on his SF 86, he reported occasional use of marijuana from\n1990 until October 2002. He further added the comment: \u201cWas a recreational user prior\nto 2002 when I entered an intensive outpatient treatment program for a DUI conviction.\nHave been clean and sober since Thanksgiving 2002.\u201d (GE 2 at 38.) \nIn his December 2007 response to DOHA Interrogatories, Applicant reported\n\u201cdaily\u201d marijuana use ending in October 2006. (GE 4 at 7.) He reported this information\nbecause he decided to correct his previous false statement that he had stopped using\nmarijuana in 2002. The Government had no other source of information about\nApplicant\u2019s actual marijuana use between 2002 and 2006. (Tr. at 67-70, 79.) Applicant\nwas awarded non-judicial punishment while in the Navy in 1985 after a urinalysis test\nthat showed he had used cocaine. (GE 1.)\nApplicant provided letters attesting to his positive post-alcohol-treatment lifestyle\nchanges and good character from two supervisors, a long-time friend, his father, sister,\nand both his wife\u2019s parents. (AE A at tabs 4-10.) His testimony during the hearing was\nforthright and credible.\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 82.): \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe evidence shows that Applicant has paid about half of his delinquent federal\ntax debt, and most of his delinquent taxes in his current state which were not alleged in\nthe SOR. However, he still has at least 12 outstanding, acknowledged, SOR-listed\ndelinquent debts totaling in excess of $28,600. His monthly income falls about $1,000\nshort of being sufficient to pay his present bills and make payments toward those two\ntax debts and a $14,000 loan from his father. He and his wife borrow $1,000 a month\nfrom his mother-in-law to make up that difference. Substantial security concerns are\nraised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The five\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n7\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented roof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose over 20 years, and a substantial number and\namount remain delinquent at present. His family budget is such that they have to borrow\n$1,000 per month from family to make payments toward two tax liens, and avoid\nincurring additional delinquent debts. They may receive some compensation for his\nwife\u2019s injuries, but the amount and timing of any such recovery are completely unknown.\nPart of their present inability to repay these debts resulted from her inability to resume\nworking after her 2006 automobile accident, but most of their delinquent debts predate\nthat incident. Applicant offered no evidence of financial counseling or any\ncomprehensive plan to address his debt. He is repaying two delinquent tax debts, but\nhas not contacted any of the remaining creditors to arrange repayments because he\nhas no funds available to do so. He originally disputed the amount of one state tax\nclaim, but did not follow through and the time for disputing that liability has passed. He\nalso stated that he wanted to dispute some of the claimed $3,920 medical bill, but has\nnot taken any steps to do so.\nThis evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e).\nApplicant and his family remain financially over-extended to a significant extent. He has\nsignificantly improved his lifestyle and begun to address his financial obligations in a\nresponsible manner, but insufficient time has passed to establish a clear record of\ntrustworthiness, reliability and good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n8\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the evidence\nin this case is:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant provided a false denial, concerning his marijuana use between October\n2002 and November 2006, in response to question24 on his 2006 SF 86. He certified\nthe completeness and accuracy of his answers, acknowledging the obligation to be\ntruthful. He knew this was false when he completed the questionnaire. The weight of\nevidence in this record leads to the conclusion that his false response to this question\nwas deliberate. \nApplicant was asked to describe his history of drug use in DOHA Interrogatories,\nand voluntarily corrected the false information described above in his December 2007\nanswer. The Government had no other source of information about this drug use. This\nestablishes the personal conduct mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 17(a): \u201cthe\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d Although the correction occurred\njust over a year after the original falsification, it took place during Applicant\u2019s next\ncommunication with the Government on the subject of his drug use. He was not\nconfronted with the facts, because no one in the Government knew what the facts were.\nThe revelation was in response to a general question, and was made with the intent to\nbe forthright and set the record straight. The original falsification was made very near\nthe same time that Applicant decided to stop using marijuana, and was intended to be\ndeceptive in that regard. He has not used marijuana since November 2006, and\nadmitted to the recent use after a year of abstinence. Given his 21-year history of\nsignificant drug use, his willingness to falsify his SF 86 about that use establishes\nsignificant concerns about his candor, judgment and willingness to follow rules and\nregulations. On balance, the mitigating effect of his December 2007 voluntary disclosure\nis insufficient to overcome those concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n9\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves substantial delinquent debts that he cannot afford to repay, and\nfalsification about recent drug use on his security clearance application. Applicant is a\nmature, experienced adult who is accountable for his decisions and conduct. His debts\narose over a lengthy period, and persist to date. There is ongoing potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress since he remains financially overextended. His\nsubstantial and responsible steps to stop drinking and abusing drugs, and to resolve the\ndebts as he can afford to do so are commendable, but it will be some time before he\ncan become solvent. His falsification concerning recent drug use took place on his\npresent application for a clearance, and was done to conceal relevant negative\ninformation. His indebtedness is quite likely to continue in the foreseeable future. In light\nof his lengthy substance abuse history, recurrence of concealment of such activity was\nnot shown to be unlikely.  \nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness security concerns arising from his failure to satisfy debts, history of\nnot meeting financial obligations, and falsification on his clearance application. Overall,\nthe record evidence leaves substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal\nconduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\n           AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                 Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:                                   Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:                                   Against Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 18, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines J, E, G and H. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 16, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 19, 2008. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on September 4, 2008. The case was assigned to me on\nOctober 21, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn 1996, applicant was fired from job as a lab technician because of excessive\nabsenteeism and tardiness.\nIn 2000, applicant left his employment after being warned in writing about\nexcessive absenteeism and tardiness.\nIn 2001, applicant was fired from his defense contractor job, and his security\nclearance was revoked, after admitting during an investigation that he may have left an\nobject inside a satellite while working on a space launch program.\nIn 2002, applicant went to an emergency room of a hospital complaining of\ndepression and insomnia. He was evaluated for auditory and visual hallucinations.\nDuring his intake examination, he admitted that he had used cocaine and abused\nalcohol three days earlier.\nIn November 2005, applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol (DUI). He was convicted of the charge, fined, and ordered to enroll\nin an alcohol counseling program. In response to interrogatories sent to him by DOHA in\nDecember 2007, applicant stated he attended six weeks of counseling and eight AA\nmeetings as a result of the court\u2019s order. He further stated that he was last intoxicated in\nNovember 2005, he last consumed alcohol in December 2007 at a wedding, and he\ndoes not intend to consume alcohol anymore.\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) in August 2005. In response to Question 24, applicant denied any illegal drug\nuse during the previous seven years. This response was false because, as noted\nabove, he had used cocaine in 2002.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n\n3\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s DUI conviction and\nintentional misrepresentation of material facts on the 2005 e-QIP (a felony under 18\nU.S.C. 1001) raise these two disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\nGuideline H:  Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set forth in Paragraph 24 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n4\nParagraph 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 25.a., \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying.\nApplicant\u2019s cocaine use raises this disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 26 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 26.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s isolated incident of cocaine use occurred over five years\nago when he was depressed over losing his job. This mitigating condition is applicable.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in Paragraph 21 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise a security concern. Under\nParagraph 22.a., \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s DUI conviction and abuse of\nalcohol immediately prior to his 2002 visit to the hospital emergency room require\napplication of this disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 23 of the AG sets out potentially mitigating conditions. Under\nParagraph 23.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d It has been over five years since the emergency room visit, and almost\nthree years since applicant\u2019s DUI arrest, and there is no evidence he has consumed\nalcohol to excess since November 2005. This mitigation condition is applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n5\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false\nmaterial information on the e-QIP. Under Paragraph 16.c., \u201ccredible adverse information\nin several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination\nunder any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s poor job history, use of cocaine, DUI\nconviction, and falsification of the e-QIP raise this disqualifying condition.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man with a\nhistory of employment difficulties, alcohol abuse, illegal drug use, and dishonesty.\nAlthough his statements in response to the SOR and FORM indicate that he accepts\nresponsibility for his actions and has started to straighten out his life, these\nuncorroborated statements of reform cannot be given much weight in view of his\nintentional falsification of material facts on the e-QIP. Applicant failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns arising from the four guidelines.\n\n6\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline G: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 4, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nled.  \n                                                          \n \nOn June 14, 2008, Applicant wrote a letter to DOHA, apparently in response to \nthe SOR, stating among other things that she wished to have a decision based on the \nwritten record. GE 2. The Department Counsel exercised his prerogative under the \nAdditional Procedural Guidance of the Directive and requested a hearing. Applicant \nsubsequently answered the SOR in writing on August 6, 2008. DOHA received her \nresponse on August 11, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nSeptember 22, 2008, and the case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nOctober 2, 2008.  \n \nOn October 15, 2008, the case was reassigned to me due to caseload \nconsiderations.

GE 1 \u2013 8.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified two separate line items, which included a collection \naccount for a credit card in the amount of $10,650, and a second collection account \nfor a credit card in the amount of $3,921. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. -1.b.) \n \nAlthough Applicant admitted the first debt of $10,650 in her Response to SOR, \nshe amended her answer and denied this debt at her hearing. She stated after she \ninvestigated this debt, she determined the account was not hers. She pointed to a \ndiscrepancy in account numbers and added that she contacted the creditor to inform \nthem of same. The creditor was unable to locate the account alleged in their database. \nShe filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency on February 4, 2009. Applicant \nadamantly denied incurring the charges as alleged with this creditor. AE B, Tr. 27-36. \n \nApplicant did admit owing the second debt of $3,921.

Applicant \nrecently began receiving social security at the monthly rate of $596. Tr. 52. \n \nApplicant and her husband own their home, which they purchased in October \n2003 for $137,000. Their monthly payments are $577 and they owe a balance of \n$88,000. They are current on their house payments and other expenses. Tr. 45-47. \nAlthough current on other expenses, Applicant and her husband depend on her \nincome with the defense contractor to augment their income. Tr. 55. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer views her as a valued employee and continues to sponsor \nher for a security clearance. Ex. I, Tr. 8. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established Applicant indebtedness as initially reflected in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.b. Applicant\u2019s indebtedness stems from her husband\u2019s reduced \nincome following his being placed on disability in 1994 and her six-year period of \nunemployment. During this time, she fell behind with at least one of her creditors as \nadmitted to during her hearing (SOR \u00b6 1.b.).  \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline F by showing Applicant \nowed the debts as alleged, except as noted, by the evidence presented. Under AG \u00b6 \n19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are three potentially mitigating conditions: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because, at the time Applicant incurred her indebtedness, \nher husband was disabled and she was unemployed for a six-year period. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts as it pertains to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Lastly, AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies because Applicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. She has contacted the creditor and provided documentation to the credit \nreporting agency substantiating the basis of her dispute. Applicant has demonstrated \nshe is living within her means and is financially responsible.  \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d2 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 9, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations except two of the debts.\n1\nApplicant identifies as a factual error the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant had been steadily employed since\n2\nFebruary 2000.  While there are imprecise references in the transcript to unemployment, Applicant\u2019s detailed\nemployment history in his appeal constitutes new evidence.  However, even if the Judge\u2019s statement about Applicant\u2019s\nsteady employment were considered to be in error, it would be harmless because correction of that statement would  not\nlikely change the Judge\u2019s decision. \n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 17, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge David M. White denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe security concerns identified by the government in the SOR involve 15 debts under\nGuideline F, as well as intoxication and three alcohol-related arrests under Guideline G .   The Judge\n1\nmade formal findings against Applicant as to all of the allegations under Guideline G and as to 12\nof the 15 debts under Guideline F.  In his appeal, Applicant raises arguments only with regard to the\nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions under Guideline F.  The appeal primarily consists of information\nnot presented at the hearing\u2014i.e., new evidence.  This evidence includes steps Applicant has taken\nsince the hearing to resolve his financial situation, such as contacting creditors and making payments\non the repayment plan initiated shortly before the hearing.   The Board cannot consider this\n2\ninformation because the Directive does not allow the Board to consider new evidence.  See Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.29; and ISCR Case No. 06-22628 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2007).\nApplicant presents no appeal to the Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings and conclusions under\nGuideline G.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  See, e,g., ISCR Case No. 06-18998 at 3\n(App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\n   \nSigned: Michael D.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked for two and a half years. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m, and 2.a through 2.d. Those admissions are incorporated in the following findings. Although he has been continuously employed since at least February 2000, he admittedly incurred 11 delinquent medical debts, totaling $15,327, and two other delinquent debts totaling $3,056, during that period. (Answer to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m; Tr. at 44-56, 74-75.) On June 5, 2008, he paid the $825 medical debt that became delinquent in March 2007, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a,. (AE A at 3; Tr. at 44-46.) He disputed owing the $8,728 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. He claimed, without corroborating documentation, that it represented an official business credit card from a former employer that he had used for expenses that should have been reimbursed by that employer. He has not contacted either the creditor or the former employer to attempt resolution of this matter, however. (Answer to SOR at 3; Tr. at 56.) On June 25, 2007, he paid the $419 deficiency, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o, that gave rise to the tax lien filed against him in June 2005. On August 8, 2008, he settled the $556 delinquent telephone debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, for $400. (Answer to SOR at 4; AE A at 4, 5; AE C at 3, 4; Tr. at 57.)

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has substantial delinquent debt that he only recently began to repay.\nHe had alcohol-related convictions in 1994, 2000, and 2004, and continues to consume\nalcohol. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on February 28, 2007. On April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and G. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nSeptember 17, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 21, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on May 5, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 20, 2008, and DOHA assigned\nthe case to me on June 26, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 8, 2008, and Applicant acknowledged\nreceiving it at least 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 11-12.) Although DOHA has not\nyet received his signed receipt for the notice of hearing that was to be delivered through\nhis company\u2019s facility security officer, he received a copy of the notice via electronic\nmail on July 8, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 31, 2008.\nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until August 14, 2008, in order for him to\nsubmit additional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August\n12, 2008. On that same date, Applicant submitted additional documents to Department\nCounsel. He did not submit any further evidence, and Department Counsel forwarded\nApplicant\u2019s submission without objection to its consideration on August 15, 2008. These\ndocuments were marked AE C, and the record was closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor two and a half years. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m, and 2.a through 2.d. Those admissions are incorporated in the\nfollowing findings. \nAlthough he has been continuously employed since at least February 2000, he\nadmittedly incurred 11 delinquent medical debts, totaling $15,327, and two other\ndelinquent debts totaling $3,056, during that period. (Answer to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through\n1.m; Tr. at 44-56, 74-75.) On June 5, 2008, he paid the $825 medical debt that became\ndelinquent in March 2007, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a,. (AE A at 3; Tr. at 44-46.) He\ndisputed owing the $8,728 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. He claimed, without\ncorroborating documentation, that it represented an official business credit card from a\nformer employer that he had used for expenses that should have been reimbursed by\nthat employer. He has not contacted either the creditor or the former employer to\nattempt resolution of this matter, however. (Answer to SOR at 3; Tr. at 56.) On June 25,\n2007, he paid the $419 deficiency, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o, that gave rise to the tax lien\nfiled against him in June 2005. On August 8, 2008, he settled the $556 delinquent\ntelephone debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m, for $400. (Answer to SOR at 4; AE A at 4, 5; AE\nC at 3, 4; Tr. at 57.)\nOn July 30, 2008, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt collection\nagency that covered ten delinquent medical debts, totaling $11,790. This agreement\ncovers the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.j, and an $84 debt that was not listed\nin the SOR. The agreement called for him to make a $100 payment on July 30, for\n\n3\nwhich he provided a receipt, and another $100 payment on August 8, 2008, followed by\n$200 payments every two weeks. This plan includes a total of 59 payments, the final of\nwhich will be due on October 29, 2010. This plan does not cover the $2,799 medical\ndebt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, which remains unresolved. (AE A at 1-2, 7-9; Tr. at 46-54,\n71-73.)\nApplicant provided a personal financial statement in January 2008 showing\nmonthly income of $5,287 and monthly expenses of $4,385 (he erroneously counted his\nmortgage payment twice on the form). At the hearing, he provided another financial\nstatement for July 2008, showing $3,259 in net income and $2,662 in expenses. The\nreduced income resulted because his fianc\u00e9e quit her job at an insurance company and\nstarted selling insurance on her own. The reduced expenses reflected lower utility costs\nin the summer, lower daycare costs since his fianc\u00e9e works from their home, and final\npayment on one of his vehicle loans. Neither statement reflected the $400 monthly\npayments called for in the debt repayment plan, but both reflected a sufficient surplus to\ncover them. The delinquent debts that remain unresolved all arose between 2001 and\n2005, with most of them from 2002. He is not presently incurring additional debt, and\nthe family has some savings. Applicant\u2019s home is worth about $78,000, with a $54,000\nbalance due on the mortgage. (GE 6 at I-6; AE A at 1; Tr. at 79-84.)\nApplicant also admitted the truth of all the alcohol consumption allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.d. He has consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point\nof intoxication, since 1994 and continues to do so. He was arrested for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (DUI) in November 2000 and February 2004, and convicted of both\noffenses. He was also arrested and convicted in 1994 for illegal possession of alcohol\nwhen he was 18 years old. After his second DUI conviction, he completed a one-year\noutpatient alcohol treatment program. (GE 4; AE B; Tr. at 57-66, 70-71, 76-78.)\nApplicant submitted letters from his fianc\u00e9e, current and former managers, and a friend,\nall of whom attested to his good character and work performance. (AE C at 5, 6, 10, 11.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances: \u201c(a) inability or\n\n5\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n(Tr. at 86.)\nApplicant has at least an eight-year history of failing to satisfy legitimate financial\nobligations, both large and small. He made one $100 payment, under a 27-month plan\nhe just entered into to pay off $11,790 in delinquent medical debts, and showed no\nprogress toward resolving three other bad debts totaling $14,027. He did resolve three\nof the SOR-listed debts totaling $1,800. All of these debts became delinquent during a\nperiod when Applicant was continuously employed, and his present financial\ncircumstances do not indicate an ability to resolve them in the near term. Substantial\nsecurity concerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The five\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented roof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose during the last eight years, and a substantial\nnumber and amount remain delinquent at present. His family budget is such that he\ndoes not have the means to repay them, and he will have less money available to repay\nthose debts when winter utility bills increase. A large portion of his more than $25,700 in\ndelinquent debts are medical bills, but he provided no evidence that these arose from\nunexpected medical emergencies. Applicant offered no evidence that he either sought\nor followed financial counseling, or that he has any comprehensive plan to address\nmore than half of his debt. He has not contacted some of his creditors to arrange\nrepayments despite statements of intent to do so. He said that he disputes the amount\n\n6\nclaimed on his $8,728 credit card debt, but has not followed through with the creditor or\nhis former employer about that liability. There is insufficient indication in this record that\nhis financial issues are either under control or likely to improve in the foreseeable future.\nThe Appeal Board explained the analysis applicable to determining whether an\napplicant has mitigated financial concerns arising from delinquent debt as follows:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the\nSOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant repaid three debts\nworth $1,800, but has paid only $100 toward $11,790 in medical debts and has done\nnothing about three other debts totaling over $14,000. He demonstrated some progress\nand the beginning of a program to reduce his debts over the next several years. This is\na good start, but it is too early in the process to find substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n20(a) through (e). \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government in\nthis case are: \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\n\n7\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\u201d and, although not specifically mentioned by Department Counsel\nduring the hearing, \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d\nApplicant admitted to consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of\nintoxication from approximately 1994 until at least August 2006, in his answer to the\nSOR, and he continues to consume alcohol. He committed DUI offenses in 2000 and\n2004, and illegal possession of alcohol when he was 18 years old. The Government has\nestablished security concerns under this guideline, shifting the burden of proof to\nApplicant to mitigate those concerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant did not establish mitigation under \u00b6 23(a). His three alcohol-related\noffenses occurred over a span of ten years, with the most recent only four years ago.\nHe did not show that such conduct is unlikely to recur, or that it no longer casts doubt on\nhis reliability and judgment. He successfully completed a treatment program after his\n2004 DUI, without further documented alcohol-related incidents. There is no evidence of\nanything but moderate alcohol use since he completed that program. These matters\ngenerate some mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and\n23(d), although no favorable prognosis by a duly qualified person was provided.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves substantial delinquent debts that he has only recently started to repay,\nand a lengthy history of both financial irresponsibility and alcohol-related incidents of\nvarious types and degrees of seriousness. Applicant is a mature, experienced adult who\nis accountable for his decisions and conduct. All incidents of security concern, except\nthe 1994 illegal possession of alcohol, arose after he was 25 years old. \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose over a lengthy period, and persist to date. There is\nongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress since he remains\nfinancially overextended. He completed a one-year alcohol treatment program several\nyears ago, in connection with his 2004 DUI offense, and has no alcohol-related\nincidents since then. Both his recent debt repayment efforts and moderation of alcohol\nuse are substantial steps in the right direction toward rehabilitation, but insufficient time\nhas passed to support a present conclusion that legitimate security concerns are fully\nmitigated. It is premature to determine that his rehabilitation and behavioral changes are\npermanent, or that recurrence of financial or alcohol-related irresponsibility is unlikely.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his failure to satisfy debts, history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, and pattern of alcohol-related incidents. Overall, the\nrecord evidence leaves substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and alcohol\nconsumption. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\n           AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                 Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:                                  Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:                                   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Sykstus, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on September 23,\n2005. On March 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign influence\n(Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR is dated March 31, 2008. Based on a careful\nevaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for security clearance\naccess is granted. At the hearing, the government submitted two exhibits (GE 1-2). I\ntook administrative notice of several publications from United States Government\nagencies that describe the Taiwanese government, its human rights record internally,\nand its practice collecting intelligence from other countries. At the hearing, testimony\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n2\nwas taken from Applicant. He also submitted three exhibits (AE A through AE D). DOHA\nreceived the transcript on August 14, 2008.\nRulings on Procedure\nDuring the preliminary segment of the hearing, Applicant contended that\nadministrative notice not be taken of Exhibits 5, 6, and 7 because the documents were\nirrelevant, in that the underlying information in the exhibits failed to contain any\nsignificant evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s predilection for foreign influence. I overruled\nthe objection because the exhibits show that there have been recent events where\nAmericans have been targeted for information. These events have led to successful\nprosecution of the parties involved.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all five factual allegations listed under the foreign influence\nguideline of the SOR, but denied that his immediate family members make him\nvulnerable to foreign influence. Applicant is 48 years old and married with two children.\nHe has been employed by the same employer (a defense contractor) since 1992. He\nseeks a secret security clearance. This is the first time Applicant has applied for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant was born in Taiwan in April 1960. In 1982, he received his Bachelor of\nScience degree in Engineering from a Taiwanese university. He served in the\nTaiwanese Army from 1982 to 1984. Every male 18 years of age or older has to serve\nin the military. From 1984 to 1986, he was employed at a computer software business.\nHe met his future wife during this employment. \nAfter marrying his wife in Taiwan in June 1986, Applicant came to the United\nStates (U.S.) for additional education. He enrolled at a postgraduate program at an\nmiddle eastern U.S. university for two years, then transferred to a local university in\n1988, and was awarded his Master of Science degree in Engineering in May 1992. In\nJune 1992, Applicant began working permanently for his current employer as an\nengineer. \nApplicant\u2019s first child, a boy, born in the U.S. in 1989, is 19 years old. His\ndaughter was born in the U.S. in August 1993. Applicant has lived at the same address\nin the local area since 1997. Applicant purchased the plot, and a builder constructed the\nhouse. \nThe SOR indicates that Applicant traveled to Taiwan three times since coming to\nthe U.S. in 1986. In 1999, Applicant traveled to Taiwan for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral\nduring a three-day stay. He went back for his grandmother\u2019s funeral in 2000. When he\n\n Applicant traveled to Taiwan in June and not January 2006, as alleged in the SOR. See,\n1\nAE D.\n3\ntraveled to Taiwan in June 2006  for his father\u2019s 70  birthday, he used his United States\n1\nth\n(U.S.) passport that he received in June 2005. \nApplicant became a naturalized citizen in May 2005, and received his U.S.\npassport one month later. Applicant\u2019s wife received her American citizenship in April\n2003, two years earlier than Applicant because some of his naturalization paperwork\nwas lost and he had to resubmit additional information. \nApplicant has been employed by his employer since 1992, and enjoys his work.\n(Tr. 32) He wants to remain with his employer as he makes his American dream come\ntrue. (Tr. 36) If any effort is made to try to pressure or threaten him, Applicant will inform\nhis security officer and the government if the circumstances warrant. (Tr. 37)\nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Taiwan in August 1937, and is 71 years old;\nApplicant\u2019s mother is deceased. The father was a carpenter in the country\u2019s Air Force\nfrom 1958 to 1961. The record does not reveal the occupation of his father after his\nmilitary obligation ended, but Applicant\u2019s notarized answers reflect that he was never\nemployed by the Taiwanese government. (GE 2) Applicant\u2019s father has visited him\nabout five times in the last 12 years, with the most recent visit occurring in June 2008.\nSometimes, his father has traveled to the U.S. and returned home without visiting\nApplicant. Applicant\u2019s contact with his father is by phone only because his father does\nnot use e-mail. The contacts range from weekly to monthly. Since his father lives in the\nsame apartment building as his sisters, some of the phone contacts are made by\nApplicant\u2019s sisters to advise him on his father\u2019s condition. Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nsisters is less, and is triggered by changes in his father\u2019s health.  \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother and two sisters were born in Taiwan. His brother was\nborn in January 1962. He became a helicopter flight instructor in the Taiwan Army in\n1983. He retired from that position in 2006, then in October 2006, found employment\nwith a Taiwanese defense contractor in engineering maintenance. (Tr. 25)\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his brother are less than with his sisters. The telephone\ncontacts are sporadic, (Tr. 44) with the last physical contact occurring at their father\u2019s\nbirthday in June 2006. Applicant\u2019s brother receives a pension through the government\u2019s\nmilitary pension system.\nApplicant has never talked to his brother about what the brother does in his\nemployment as a contractor. Applicant has only a general idea about what his brother\ndoes (Tr. 28), and he received that information from his sister. (Tr. 63, 64) \nApplicant\u2019s older sister was born in Taiwan in March 1957. According to GE 2,\nshe is not employed by the government. She is divorced from her husband who works\nin a furniture manufacturing plant. Applicant\u2019s younger sister was born in Taiwan in\n\n4\nDecember 1963. She has never been employed by the government. Her husband was a\nmanufacturer of connectors that lock little resistors into computer boards. He lost his\nbusiness and is now working for a machine tool company. (Tr. 46-49)\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in Taiwan in November 1940. She has never\nbeen employed by the government. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is deceased. \nApplicant, his father and brother have served in the Taiwanese military. (GE 2,\nsection 3) None of his other immediate family members have ever been employed by,\nor been a member of any foreign government, an agency or part of a foreign\ngovernment, foreign military, a municipal government in a foreign country, or\nbusiness/educational institution, or other organization that is wholly or partially owned by\na foreign government, or a smaller governmental structure in Taiwan. (Id. at section 3\nand 4) Applicant has no financial interests in any foreign country; he estimates his net\nworth in the U.S. to be approximately $600,000.00. (Id. at sections 21 and 22)\nCharacter Evidence\nThe Director of Engineering services began working for Applicant\u2019s employer in\n1996, after 30 years of service in the U.S. Air Force. From his daily professional contact\nwith Applicant over the past 12 years, where the Director may see Applicant up to a\ndozen times a day (Tr. 74), and traveling with Applicant on projects around the U.S.,\nand having continually observed Applicant\u2019s quality work, the Director has no\nreservations about recommending him for a position of trust with the government, even\nwith the director\u2019s knowledge that Applicant\u2019s brother is a retired officer in the\nTaiwanese Army. (Tr. 80-83)\nThe President of Applicant\u2019s employer hired Applicant on a part-time basis in the\nearly 1990s while Applicant was still in graduate school. When Applicant graduated in\nMay 1992, the President hired him full time. From her daily observations of him since\n1992, the President considers him a diligent, trustworthy worker who is conscientious\nabout security issues. (Tr. 108) Since December 2000, the President has rewarded\nApplicant\u2019s quality work on a yearly basis with a letter of congratulations and a cash\nbonus. (AE C) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified she has been married to Applicant for the past 22 years.\nThey have two children, ages 19 and 15. His wife became a citizen in 2003, and\nreceived her security clearance in May 2007. Applicant\u2019s wife received her Master\u2019s\ndegree in Computer Science and for the last five years, has been employed by a\ncomputer software business. \nApplicant and his wife have been members of their church for the last five years.\nApplicant operates the media group sound control duties for church services or special\nevents, while his wife operates the power point apparatus for lyrics and videos. (Tr. 61)\nIn addition, they lead a weekly religious study group for new immigrants of the church.\nThey pass along their own experiences so the new immigrants can make swifter\n\n5\nadjustments to life in the U.S. With their involvement in church activities including the\nchildren\u2019s program, Applicant and his wife enjoy a good reputation among church\nmembers. (Tr. 117) Applicant\u2019s son participated in the children\u2019s program until he\nenrolled in college. Applicant\u2019s daughter still takes part along with twenty college\nstudents, who currently volunteer their time for the children\u2019s program. (Tr. 96) Applicant\nand his wife also participate in the Parents/Teachers Association (PTA) by collecting\nfees for sport and recreational events. (Tr. 54, 97)\nAdministrative Notice\nTaiwan, a country with a democratic system of government, was established by\nrefugees from mainland China (PRC) in 1949. While the U.S. has recognized only the\nPRC as the sole government of China since January 1979, under the Taiwan Relations\nAct of 1979, the U.S. still conducts unofficial relations with Taiwan. The country is a\nmajor trading partner with the U.S., as well as other countries around the world. Taiwan\nbelongs to the World Trade Association. and has a lengthy history of cooperation with\nthe U.S. military in intelligence missions in previous regional military conflicts. Taiwan\nreceives most of its defensive weapons from the U.S. to ensure the country\u2019s defensive\ncapability. The country is an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence information.\nSince ending martial law in 1987, the government has taken dramatic measures to\nincrease respect for human rights and to improve the Taiwanese democratic system of\ngovernment.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law that recognize the complexities of\nhuman behavior, and are to be applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt  concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with the risk of terrorism.\u201d \u00b6\n6.\nThe mere possession of family ties in a foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the FI guideline. ISCR Case No. 98-0507 (App. Bd. Dec. and Rem.\nOrd., May 17, 1999) at 10. However, the citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s\nfather, brother and sisters in Taiwan, and Applicant\u2019s three trips to Taiwan since 1999,\ncreate the potential for foreign influence under Foreign Influence (FI) disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion). \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, the DOHA Appeal Board has held that\nthere is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has close ties of affection, or at least\nobligation, to members of his wife\u2019s family. ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 8 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 20, 2002). Therefore, a potential for foreign influence extends to Applicant\u2019s\nmother-in-law who is a resident citizen of Taiwan.\n\n7\nTo determine whether Applicant faces a heightened risk of foreign influence due\nto the citizenship/residence of his foreign family members depends a number of factors\nother than the citizenship and residence of members, including the political character of\nthe foreign country in question, its relationship to the U.S., and the prospects an\napplicant\u2019s family members may be subject to pressure or coercion. If the foreign family\nmember is associated/employed or dependent on the government, or the government is\nauthoritarian, then the chances for foreign influence directed to and through the foreign\nfamily member are more likely. Even friendly nations like Taiwan, i.e., those that may\nhave the same type of democratically elected government as the U.S., with a history of\ngood relations, do not always have the same interests. Taiwan has targeted the U.S. for\neconomic information. But, Taiwan has also become a strategic partner with the U.S. on\ndefensive issues, and has significantly improved its human rights record with its\ncitizens. Given the defensive and commercial interests Taiwan has in common with the\nU.S., the country is not likely to jeopardize that relationship by applying coercive or non-\ncoercive pressure on its citizens to reach naturalized American citizens.\nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members work for the Taiwanese government or any\nforeign government. Applicant\u2019s father, 71 years old, has visited Applicant five times in\nthe last eleven years. The former husband of Applicant\u2019s older sister works in a furniture\nmanufacturing plant. The husband of Applicant\u2019s younger sister works in a machine tool\ncompany. Applicant\u2019s relations with his father and siblings appear to be grounded upon\nfamily rather than commercial relationships. His three  trips to Taiwan were either to visit\nor bury his family members. Applicant\u2019s brother is currently employed as a defense\ncontractor in engineering maintenance, after a long career as a helicopter pilot. There is\nno evidence in the record that his brother has been involved in gathering intelligence,\neither as a pilot or in his current contractor position. There is very little information in the\nrecord concerning Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law. Viewing the record in its entirety, it is\nunlikely Applicant will be pressured into a position of having to choose between his\nfamily members in Taiwan and interests of the U.S. FC MC 8.a. (the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe position or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.)\napplies. \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and long lasting relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest) also applies to show there is no conflict of interest between Applicant, his\nforeign family members and the U.S. Applicant has a net worth in the U.S. of about\n$600,000.00. He and his family have lived in the local area since 1993. He and his\nfamily have been living at the same address since 1997. In sum, Applicant\u2019s\naccomplishments as a U.S. citizen in his professional career and family life provide\nample evidence to conclude he will resolve even a potential conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. Though FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\n\n8\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation) is inapplicable because of Applicant\u2019s regular contacts with his\nfather, the level of contact does not disqualify Applicant\u2019s security clearance application.\nApplicant\u2019s trips to Taiwan have no independent security significance under the FI\nguideline. Accordingly, Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. are found for Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAfter marrying his wife in June 1986, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. to advance\nhis education. After spending two years at a school in the middle eastern part of the\nU.S., he transferred to a local university in 1988 to continue his graduate studies, and\nbegan working part-time for his current employer. After he was awarded his Master\u2019s\ndegree in Mechanical Engineering in May 1992, his current employer hired him\npermanently in June 1992. For 16 years, Applicant has provided a quality work product\nand dedication to security issues that the Director of engineering and the President of\nthe company find very commendable. The President has acknowledged Applicant eight\ntimes since 2000 for his outstanding job performance. \nThe commitment that is found in Applicant\u2019s 16-year professional career can\nreadily be found in his family life. He has been married to his wife for 22 years, and they\nhave two children, 19 and 15. His wife has been working at a computer software\nbusiness for the past five years, and obtained her security clearance in May 2007.\nApplicant and his wife have become very active in all facets of their church, and have\nwatched their children provide meaningful contributions to the religious study program\nand the children\u2019s program of the church. Given Applicant\u2019s strong professional, family\nand economic roots (approximately $600,000.00 net worth) in the U.S., and his credible\ntestimony at the hearing, his potential for foreign influence is very improbable. The\nforeign influence guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on November 11,\n2006. On March 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on April 24, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 28, 2008 for a hearing on August 13, 2008. The hearing was\nheld as scheduled. At the hearing, seven exhibits (GE 1 through 7) were admitted in\nevidence without objection to support the government\u2019s case. Applicant testified and\nsubmitted four exhibits. (AE A-AE D) In the time allowed for Applicant to furnish\nadditional documentation, he submitted AE E through AE J. The additional\nNovember 26, 2008\n\n Applicant worked for this contractor from 1986 to 2003 (GE 1). \n1\n2\ndocumentation provides updated information on most of the debts in the SOR. DOHA\nreceived a copy of the transcript of the proceedings on August 20, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR has eight allegations under the financial considerations guideline,\ntotaling approximately $31,000.00. With the interest and penalties added to SOR 1.c,\nApplicant\u2019s total debt eclipses $40,000.00. He admitted all allegations except for SOR\n1.b., explaining that he paid the debt in full.\nApplicant is 51 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a test\nengineer. He has been married for 32 years and has two children, 29 and 27 years old.\nHe has held a security clearance since 1977 (GE 1) He seeks a secret clearance. \nApplicant was trained in avionics and has held aerospace jobs over the years. In\n1999, he was working for a contractor,  when he decided to run for state X\u2019s senate. He\n1\nwon the seat. From 1999 to December 2002, he served in the state senate in addition to\nhis contractor job. \nIn January 2003, based on promises from two two ministers at his church (who\nbecame corporate officers in this venture with him), Applicant became an officer in a\ncorporation. The objective of the enterprise was to improve business between country Y\nto the south, the U.S., and country Z to the north. It was determined that the best way\nwas by upgrading the road way that started in country Y to the south, which continued\nthrough the United States (U.S.) and ended in country Z to the north.  Applicant\u2019s\ncorporate function was to oversee the engineering, planning and construction of the\nproject. He was told the project would receive international funds from the United\nNations and the World Bank (Tr. 28-29). As chief operating officer of the corporation, he\nwas promised a lot of money, but only received about $10,000.00 in the first two months\nof the project (Tr. 73). The project began in January 2003, and shut down in March\n2005. Applicant lost everything, including his house and savings (Tr. 36). Applicant\nopined that the corporate project folded because the chief financial officer and chief\nexecutive officer had been misrepresenting their expertise and ability to get the project\nfully funded (Id.)\nAfter the commercial project ceased business in March 2005. Applicant was\nunderemployed until he was hired by his current employer in September 2006.\nApplicant is presently living in a recreational vehicle to keep expenses low. \nGE 2 reflects that Applicant satisfied two unlisted creditors in 2005 and 2006.\nOne creditor was a mortgage lender, and the amount owed was approximately\n$29,000.00. Correspondence within GE 2 and in GE 5 reflect the account was paid in\n\n3\nSeptember 2005. The second account was satisfied in November 2006, but the\npayment amount was not disclosed. \nApplicant stated he paid enrollment fees for a debt consolidation plan in January\n2008 (GE 2; Tr. 66), but the organization went bankrupt (GE 2). In April 2008, Applicant\nsigned on with another debt plan organization, and has made three payments of\nbetween $400.00 and $450.00 under the plan. The plan will call for monthly payments\nof $485.00 a month. See, AE I. The first three payments are meeting administrative fees\n(the costs of setting up the plan, including contacting  and negotiating with creditors)\nbefore the actual payment of creditors under the plan. The accounts in the plan are\nthose identified in SOR 1.a., 1.d., 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h. (Id.). The plan is scheduled to last\nfive years (Tr. 55).\nThe eight listed debts fell delinquent in 2004 and 2005, when Applicant was\nworking for the joint venture (Tr. 59-61). The overdue accounts are personal credit\ncards or loans. \n\u2022 SOR 1.a. The $544.00 account was placed for collection in April 2007; the last\nactivity on the account was August 2005. The account is included in the payment plan\n(Tr. 41; GE 2, AE A).\n\u2022 SOR 1.b. The last activity on this cable television account ($49.00) was in\nDecember 2005. GE 5 confirms that the debt is paid. \n\u2022 SOR 1.c. The charged off account posted at $9,179.00 in the SOR is now\n$18,586.00 due to interest and penalties (GE 4). In July 2008, Applicant signed a\nConsent Order which requires him to pay $250.00 a month until the balance is paid; his\nchecking account reflects he has made two payments under the order (AE G).\n\u2022 SOR 1.d. The last activity on this account ($4,356) was in August 2003. This\naccount is also included in Applicant\u2019s debt plan (GE 4).\n\u2022 SOR 1.e. The last activity on this account ($745.00) was in November 2004 (Tr.\n51-54; GE 4). The past due account is also a part of Applicant\u2019s debt plan (GE 2).\n\u2022 SOR 1.f. Applicant was informed by the collection company on August 26, 2005\nthat they would stop all efforts to collect this account ($463.00), and they would notify\nthe credit bureau of their decision (AE F). Applicant indicated he paid this account, and\nwas awaiting a proof of a payment letter from the creditor (Tr. 55; AE E). \n\u2022 SOR 1.g. The last activity on this collection account ($11,023.00) was August\n2003. The account is a part of Applicant\u2019s debt consolidation plan (Tr. 46; GE 4).\n\u2022 SOR 1.h. The account ($5,255.00) is the fifth delinquent account in Applicant\u2019s\ndebt plan. \n\n Applicant\u2019s check is no longer being garnisheed by the IRS (AE E).\n2\n According to his budget, Applicant is again supporting one of his children who lost his job (AE I).\n3\n4\nApplicant\u2019s monthly budget shows that his salary is $7,358.00, after expenses\nand debt payments of $485.00 a month to his debt plan, $150.00 a month to the Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS),  $250.00 a month on the consent order, and a monthly car\n2\npayment, Applicant has about $157.00 remaining every month (AE I).  \n3\nCharacter Evidence\nIn an April 2005 favorable character statement from a member of the U.S.\nCongress, Applicant\u2019s commendable work in the aerospace industry and on the rules\ncommittee of state x\u2019s senate was highlighted (AE J). A retired commercial jet pilot, with\na background in the U.S. Air Force, stated that Applicant\u2019s knowledge about aerospace\nwould make him a valuable employee in a company\u2019s flight department or in the sale of\naircraft (Id.). A fellow church member has known Applicant for two years, and is happy\nwith Applicant\u2019s committed involvement in the activities of the church. Applicant\u2019s first\nlevel supervisor since his hire in September 2006 believes Applicant warrants a position\nof trust based on his professionalism and team player attitude (Id.) Having weighed and\nbalanced the entire record with Applicant\u2019s deportment and manner of testifying during\nthe hearing, I find his testimony generally credible. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nThe record indicates Applicant still owes about $39,000.00 on six remaining\ndebts, and has been unable to pay or settle the accounts. FC disqualifying condition\n(DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply.\nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control); and, FC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). FC MC 20.a. provides\nApplicant some mitigation given the unusual circumstances under which he collected\n\n Applicant could not have predicted his earnings would stop less than three months after he began work on\n4\nthe joint venture.\n6\nthe indebtedness. On hindsight, Applicant exercised seriously poor judgment in giving\nup the security of two jobs to work on a project that lacked a real plan an adequate\ncapital. Applicant\u2019s devotion to the project is evidenced by the fact he worked for about\n24 of the 26 months without pay, and lost his house and savings as a result. \nFC MC 20.b., which mitigates when unforeseen events impede an applicant\u2019s\nefforts to honor his current or delinquent financial obligations, provides limited\nmitigation  that must be balanced against the unreasonable amount of time Applicant\n4\nremained a part of the venture instead of looking for another job.\nApplicant receives some mitigation under FC 20.c. Clearly, he still owes a large\nsum of money. However, his payoff of two delinquent debts in 2005 and 2006 even\nbefore he received the SOR, his persistence in successfully finding a debt consolidation\nprogram in April 2008, and his record of documented payments under the plan (even\nthough creditor payments have not begun), persuade me that Applicant wants to pay\nthese debts off. Furthermore, his payoff of two minor debts of the eight listed in the SOR\nentitles Applicant to limited mitigation under FC 20.d., and reinforces my belief he wants\nto eliminate his overdue accounts. Although no one mitigating condition is sufficient to\novercome the negative evidence under FC DC 19.a. and 19.c., Applicant\u2019s mitigating\nevidence under three of the four mitigating conditions meets his ultimate burden of\npersuasion under the financial considerations guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding for Applicant under the FI guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2(a)\nI have considered the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the whole\nperson concept. Applicant was about 46 years old when he left the security of two jobs\nin January 2003, and decided to take part in the commercial project based on the\nrepresentations of two friends. These friends were also ministers from his church, but\n\n7\nwere clearly incapable of making the venture a success. Though Applicant should have\nleft the failing enterprise much sooner than March 2005, he immediately found work in\nApril 2005, and was able to pay off two creditors in 2005 and 2006. Recently, Applicant\npaid off two small debts listed in the SOR. After losing enrollment funds when the first\ndebt consolidation organization went bankrupt in early 2008, Applicant successfully\nenrolled in the GE 4 organization, and has made three payments under the\norganization\u2019s debt plan that includes the six remaining creditors. He has a budget, and\nis living in a recreational vehicle to keep his expenditures under control. Applicant\u2019s\nfavorable credibility and positive character evidence, including the evidence reflecting\nhe has held a security clearance since 1977, convinces me he will complete the debt\nplan and consent decree. By all accounts, he sincerely wants to eliminate the past due\ndebt. Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation prevails under the financial considerations guideline.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor  Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is a 47-year-old senior designer for a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since January 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from October 1978 to October 1984 and was separated with a general discharge under honorable conditions (GX 4 at 24-25).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on June 1, 2007 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 4). On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guideline F.  \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2008, and requested determination \non the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s \nwritten case on May 21, 2008. On May 28, 2008, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s \nevidence. Applicant received the FORM on June 2, 2008, and he did not respond. The \ncase was assigned to me on August 15, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.d through 1.r. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old senior designer for a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since January 2003. He served on active duty in the \nU.S. Air Force from October 1978 to October 1984 and was separated with a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions (GX 4 at 24-25). He received a security clearance \nin December 1991 (GX 4 at 29). \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in March 2002 and received a \ndischarge in July 2002 (GX 5). The bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The financial \nproblems leading to this bankruptcy arose when Applicant\u2019s wife underwent surgery that \nwas not covered by insurance, and Applicant was laid off from his job at about the same \ntime. He returned to work in January 2003 at half his previous pay (Answer to SOR). \n \n \nAfter his bankruptcy discharge, Applicant again began accumulating new \ndelinquent debts. The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling about $11,727. The \nlargest debt is for $3,998 on a delinquent car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Three are for less than \n$100 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.m and 1.n). The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.r are for $137 \nand $124 respectively. \n \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He stated he paid off the debt in \nMarch 2005, but he could not produce any documentation that the debt was satisfied.  \n \n \nApplicant denied the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, the largest debt alleged. In \nhis answer to the SOR, he claimed this debt was discharged in his Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. The judgment predated the bankruptcy petition, and the creditor who \nobtained the judgment was listed in the schedule of creditors and received a copy of the \ndischarge order (GX 5).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has multiple ongoing medical problems, and Applicant suffers \nfrom hypertension. The two of them take a total of 15 prescribed medications, incurring \nuninsured copayments of $20 for each medication. His spouse averages three doctor \nvisits per month, incurring a copayment of $40 for each visit. Applicant\u2019s net monthly \nincome is about $2,400 per month, and his expenses are about $1,950, leaving a net \nremainder of about $450 for debt repayment (Answer at 2). \n\n \n3\n \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant received a $6,000 check from a source not reflected in \nthe record, and he used the money to pay off a car loan. When the check was \ndishonored, he was required to repay the bank at a rate of $350 per month. The \ndishonored check is now paid off (GX 9 at 5).  \n \n \nApplicant states he is unable to afford the monthly payments of $250 to $300 his \ncreditors have offered. His plan is to pay off one small debt each month and save \nmoney each month until he has enough to pay off one of the larger debts in full (Answer \nat 1). His answer to the SOR outlining his plan was submitted in March 2008, and he \nreceived the FORM in June 2008, but he did not submit any evidence in response to the \nFORM to show that any of the smaller debts had been paid. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n\n \n4\n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nTwo potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this \ncase. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ \nAG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history establishes both of these disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions are relevant to this case. Security concerns based \non financial problems can be mitigated by showing that Athe behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n\n \n5\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). The first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent) are not \nestablished because Applicant has numerous debts that are not yet resolved. The third \nprong (unusual circumstances not likely to recur) is established, because his financial \nproblems were aggravated by the dishonored check that was uttered to him. The final \nprong is not established because Applicant has not established a track record of timely \npayment of debts. The bad check has been resolved, but Applicant has not \ndemonstrated that he is now carrying out his plan of paying off one small debt each \nmonth. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant encountered \nseveral conditions beyond his control: loss of his job, reemployment at half his previous \npay, the bad check, and recurring health problems for himself and his spouse. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition in 2002 was a reasonable and prudent response to his \nloss of employment and unexpected medical expenses that were not covered by \ninsurance. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He has not demonstrated reasonable conduct concerning the \ndelinquent debts that he accumulated after his bankruptcy, because he has not \ndemonstrated that he is carrying out his plan to eliminate some of his smaller debts, \neven though he apparently has the financial means to do so. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received \ncounseling and the problem is not under control \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nThis condition is not established because Applicant has not demonstrated that he is \ncarrying out his plan to resolve his debts. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He was able to document the \nresolution of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he provided no documentation for his dispute \n\n \n6\nregarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established only for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has encountered numerous financial challenges. \nIn his answer to the SOR, he articulated a good grasp of his financial situation and a \nreasonable plan to resolve his delinquent debts. He has failed, however, to demonstrate \nthat he is carrying out his plan.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.r: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n7\n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F. Foreman \n \n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn November 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to  Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether\na security clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 17, 2007, and initially requested a\ndetermination on the written record.  Based on his request of January 25, 2008 to have\na hearing, his application was converted to a hearing proceeding.   The case was\nassigned to me on March 5, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on April 9, 2008.  A\nhearing was held on April 9, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nJune 23, 2008\n\n2\nconsisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and one exhibit.  The\ntranscript (R.T.) was received on April 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her payments of several of her listed debts and disputes\nof others.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days, to April 19, 2008,\nto supplement the record. The Government was afforded two days to respond. Within\nthe time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documented copies of her\nearnings statement and payment arrangements with several non-covered creditors.\nSeveral weeks later, she faxed two letters covering her intent to obtain updated credit\nreports that reflect deleted duplicated accounts.  Department counsel did not object to\nany of these post-hearing submissions.  Her post-hearing exhibits were admitted and\nconsidered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated 19 debts exceeding\n$17, 000.00.  For her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the debts (11 in\nall) and denied the rest of her listed debts.  She claimed she arranged payment plans\nwith some of her creditors and pay-offs and duplications with other creditors.  She\npledged to take full charge of her debts and pay off the owed balances on her admitted\ndebts and clear her credit within six to eight months.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old production specialist for a defense contractor with\nwhom she has over 30 years of experience.  She seeks to retain her security clearance\nfor certain programs.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant is married and has two grown children.; a daughter (age 34) and a son\n(age 29).  She helps her son financially, who lives with her along with his two children\n(ages 14 and 11).  Her son only recently emerged from incarceration and has no job\n(R.T., at 51).  Her husband was stricken with spinal meningitis in 1996 and is on\npermanent medication (R.T., at 63).  Because of his disability, he has not been able to\nhelp her much with her debts and expenses (R.T., at 47, 62-63).  As a result, Applicant\nshoulders virtually all of her son\u2019s family expenses (R.T., at 51, 63).  Just how much her\nhusband is able to contribute to Applicant\u2019s household with his disability benefits is not\ndeveloped.\nApplicant began experiencing financial problems several years ago following her\nbreast cancer diagnosis (R.T., at 55).  Because of the physical burdens associated with\n\n3\nher cancer treatment, she had to stop working.  She was initially out of work for about\nsix months for medical reasons and returned to work in January 2003 (R.T., at 56).  She\nmissed another six weeks of work between February and March 2003, and assumed a\npart time schedule on her return for the remainder of the year (R.T., at 56-60).\nApplicant\u2019s medical bills for the surgical procedures she underwent and ensuing cancer\ntreatment she received were considerable.  While her insurance company covered 85\nper cent of her bills, her cost-share was still considerable based on her income (R.T., at\n60-61).  \nPressed by her medical bills, the care of her grandchildren, and her limited work\nschedule while undergoing rigorous cancer treatment, Applicant fell behind with her\ndebts.  During this 2002-2003 time period Applicant accumulated 19 delinquent debts in\nall, exceeding $17,000.00 in the aggregate.  Several of the listed debts are either\nduplicates or debts attributable to others, and she disputes them (creditors 1.k, 1.m, 1.n\nand 1.r).   Several others she claims to have paid (creditors 1.d, 1.q, and 1.s), but for\nthe most part, she acknowledges the covered debts as her own and assures she is\naddressing them (R.T., at 28-46). \nApplicant did explore financial counseling, but found it of little benefit to her given\nher household situation and decided not to pursue counseling (R.T., at 64). Applicant\nassures she has set up payment plans with several of her creditors (creditors 1.a, 1.g,\n1.j, and 1.l), and she commits to working out settlement plans with the remainder of her\nacknowledged creditors.  Afforded an opportunity to supplement the record with\ndocumented payments and payment plans, Applicant provided documentation that her\ntwo disputed debts with creditors 1.m and 1.n were being deleted from her credit reports\nwith the principal credit reporting agencies (see ex. E). \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing documentation included an intended wage withholding\nto cover her student loan debt with a student aid commission (see ex. C).  Whether this\nis the same debt covered by creditor 1.g in the SOR is unclear, but likely, based on the\nroughly comparable amounts covered in her credit reports and post-hearing submission.\nApplicant\u2019s supplemental documentation also included proof of settlements with two\ncreditors that are listed in her credit reports but do not appear to be included in the SOR\n(see exs. 3, 4, D and E).  She did not provide any documentation, though, of payments\nor payment plans with any of her other listed creditors in the SOR.\nCurrently, Applicant has bi-weekly income of $1,277.38 (compare exs. 2 and B;\nR.T., at 67-69).  She has started a janitorial business, which she expects to add to the\ntwo cleaning jobs she already has (R.T., at 71-72).  Her current house-cleaning jobs net\nher about $120.00 a month (see ex. 2; R.T., at 71).  After deducting her estimated\nmonthly expenses (around $2,200.00, including her mortgage), she has a net monthly\nremainder of approximately (R.T., at 69).  With her current income, she has been able\nto stay current with her other debts listed in her most recent credit report (see ex. 3;\nR.T., at 62).   Applicant remains committed to paying her creditor 1.b debt, if she can\nsuccessfully enlist the creditor to return her calls.  \n\n4\nNot much is known about Applicant\u2019s work performance or trust and confidence\nin which she is held by her supervisors and coworkers. She did not provide any\ndocumentation of her performance evaluations, character references, or achievement\ncertificates. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \u201cConditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \u201cMitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial,\ncommon-sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\n\n5\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a production specialist who has held a security clearance with her\nemployer for many years and seeks a new security clearance to qualify her with access\nto some of her employer\u2019s specific programs.  Most of her listed delinquent accounts\ncontinue to remain unresolved.  Absent documented discharge or payment initiatives\nwith the listed creditors, these debts raise security significant concerns.  \n In Applicant\u2019s case, her still outstanding delinquent debts and her failure to\ndocument the debts she claims to have either paid or worked payment plans warrant\nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19 (a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19\u00a9), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d These disqualifying conditions cover the\ncore concern of AG \u00b6 18: poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which, both individually and collectively, can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts are attributable in part to medical and family\nissues associated with her disability in 2002-2003 and the care of her two\ngrandchildren, who reside with her, along with her son.  Her presented situation does\ndemonstrate extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant some application of MC\n20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.\n\n6\nWith the exception of the duplicate debts covered by creditors 1.m and 1.n,\nnone of Applicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been paid, disputed, or\nsettled.  Several of her debts, however, are quite old.  Of this group of debts, seven\nappear to be covered by her state\u2019s statute of limitations: specifically, creditors 1. a\nthrough 1.c, 1.e, and 1.q through 1.s (see exs. 3 and 4).  The state statute of limitations\nin Applicant\u2019s state for claims based on a written contract is four years See\n16.004(a)(3) of T Civ. Prac. and Rem. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16.051 (statute of limitations for\ncontracts and claims not otherwise provided for) and 16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations\nfor debts).  Applicant\u2019s listed debts with creditors 1.a through 1.c, 1.e, and 1.q through\n1.s all appear to covered by the State\u2019s statute of limitations, and are treated, as such,\nherein as debts that are time-barred.  \nWhile potentially applicable statutes of limitation have not been recognized by\nour Appeal Board to absolve security risks associated with unresolved delinquent\ndebts, statutes of limitation in general are considered important policy tools for\ndiscouraging plaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation.\nThey have never been equated with good-faith efforts, though, to repay overdue\ncreditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 2001). \nWeight, if any, to be assigned to potentially applicable statutes of limitations\nunder the new Guidelines should be considered in light of all the circumstances\nsurrounding the existing debts, and must take account of Applicant\u2019s entire history of\ndemonstrated trust and responsibility. Viewed in this whole person light, the controlling\nstate statute of limitations for written contracts and debts are entitled to be accorded\nsome mitigation weight in evaluating Applicant\u2019s overall financial risk with respect to\nthese specifically covered debts. \n                                                        \nBased on Applicant\u2019s afforded reliance on her state\u2019s four-year statute of\nlimitation to avert enforcement risk with respect to her accorded limitation-barred debts,\nmitigation credit is available to Applicant  By virtue of the age and non-enforcement\nstatus of the debts (only creditors 1.a through 1.c, 1.e, and 1.q through 1.s ), MC 20(a),\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has applicability to these specific\nlimitation-barred debts.  \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s remaining unresolved debts, mitigation credit is only\npartially available based on her proofs.  Without any documentation of her payment\nefforts and disputes concerning most of these debts (save for creditors 1.m and 1.n), \nimportant corroboration is lacking.  And while the Appeal Board has never held the lack\nof corroboration to be dispositive when assessing debt disputes (see ISCR Case No.\n02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 2006)), it has certainly considered it an important factor in\nevaluating the intrinsic reliability or weight of evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 01 -02677\n(App. Bd. October 2002).  Not helpful either to Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts is her lack\nof any demonstrable steps to seek financial counseling. \n\n7\nWithout more documented information to demonstrate she is addressing her\nlisted debts and making use of financial counseling, she cannot safely mitigate all of\nthe Government\u2019s financial concerns.  Only Applicant\u2019s duplicated debts are adequately\ndocumented and entitled to mitigation treatment.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared for access to classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases.\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18.  Without more to demonstrate progress in resolving her\nremaining debts, it is difficult to draw convincing conclusions about her overall\ntrustworthiness based on factors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the\nguideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to her still outstanding debts.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.d, 1.f\nthrough 1.l,1.o, and 1.p. of the SOR.  By contrast, favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.c, 1.e, 1.m and 1.n, and 1.q through 1.s of\nthe SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-para. 1.a:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSub-para. 1.g:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.I:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.j:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.k:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.l:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.m:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.n:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.o:\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.p\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.q:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.r:\n     FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.s\n     FOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 12,\n2007.  On November 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\n1\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF, E and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on March 11, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 28,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 17, 2008. The Government\nApril 30, 2008\n\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that she was divorced in March 2007 (Tr. 122).\n2\n2\noffered Exhibits (GE 1-18), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in\nher own behalf, and submitted Exhibits (AE A-M), without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript on April 23, 2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated December 17, 2007, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.k, 1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t. and 1.v of the SOR.\nShe also admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 2.a-2.j of the SOR but denied any\nintentional falsification. Applicant denied the other allegations because the debts were\npaid or she had no knowledge of them. She provided additional information to support\nher request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1982. In 1996, Applicant attended a business college full time one year.\nShe also received a certificate in 1997 from a computer center. She has worked for her\ncurrent employer since December 2006 (GE 1). Applicant held a security clearance\nfrom 1997 until 2004 (Tr. 40).\nApplicant married in 1986. After 12 years of marriage, she and her husband\nseparated in 1998 and remained separated for a period of 10 years.  Applicant\u2019s\n2\ndelinquent debts started after her separation from her husband in 1999 until 2001. She\nwas trying to find a place to live for herself and her son. In July 2001, Applicant\u2019s lease\nwas not renewed due to unpaid rent, and she was forced to move (Tr. 86).\nApplicant had an altercation with the apartment representative one afternoon.\nWhen she was picking up her son from school she was told that she could no longer be\non the property. An apartment representative presented her with a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d and\nApplicant shoved it back in his hand (Tr.42). The management filed assault and battery\ncharges against Applicant. She did not appear in court for the charge and a warrant for\nher arrest was outstanding.\nFrom 1997 until 2004, Applicant worked as a contractor (Tr. 54). She was\nunemployed for six months from March to September 2005, but received unemployment\nbenefits.\nApplicant was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2000. She received chemotherapy\ntreatment in 2001. She received disability payments during her treatment period (Tr.\n56).\nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts, including one tax delinquency, five\njudgments, one car repossession and approximately 14 other delinquent debts. The\n\nApplicant testified at the hearing that her wages were not garnished for 1.p debt. She made monthly\n3\npayments and it is now paid. Thus, question 34 concerning wage garnishments would not require\nApplicant to respond \u201cyes\u201d.\n3\ntotal amount of debt that Applicant owes is approximately $50,000 (GE 2, 3, 9-11, 13-18).\nApplicant admitted that the accounts in allegations \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.j,1.k, 1.l,\n1.m, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.u are not paid. Allegation 1.v for $11,718 is a student loan\nin deferment. The loan was in default until she recently reapplied for deferment.\nFor the following allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.t, Applicant\nprovided proof that she paid the accounts/judgments, in 2003, and the tax delinquency\nin 2005 (AE E-K). Allegation 1.g is in repayment status beginning in April 2008 ($20 a\nmonth) Tr. 72). \nThe current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: seven debts are\npaid and, two debts are in a payment plan. She made an appointment for financial\ncounseling last year, but did not keep the appointment (Tr. 127). She was inconsistent\nin her testimony regarding creditors that she contacted in the past few months.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $2,348. She has a part time job that\nprovides an additional $300 a month. After monthly expenses of $2,403, and current\ndebt payments of $140, she has a net remainder of $245 (AE L).\nApplicant completed her November 26, 2002 security application. In that\napplication she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 26. Your Police Record - Other Offenses, and\n\u201cno\u201d to questions 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, and 39 concerning financial matters (GE 4).3\nApplicant explained that she completely forgot about the assault and battery\narrest in 2001. She was stopped by the police for an expired decal. The police officer\nthen learned that there was an outstanding warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest for assault and\nbattery because she had not appeared in court for the charge. The court found her\nguilty. She was fined $125. \nApplicant did not answer \u201cyes\u201d to any of the questions regarding financial\nmatters. She had judgments and delinquent debts at the time. She admitted that she\nhad no reason for not listing them. At the hearing, on cross examination, Applicant\nstated \u201cthere was no reason and that she should have answered the questions\u201d in the\naffirmative on the 2002 security clearance application (Tr. 115-117). \nIn January 2004, Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance\nprocess. She reported to the investigator that a police officer stopped her for an expired\ndecal on her car. She then explained that she learned a warrant for her arrest had been\nissued because the apartment representative had filed charges against Applicant for\n\nDepartment Counsel withdrew the allegation in 2.b at the hearing. After Applicant testified, Department\n4\nCounsel noted that he had misread the report of information concerning the interview with the investigator.\n4\nAssault and Battery in the incident described above (Tr. 113). She also discussed her\nfinancial difficulties and the various debts she had incurred.4\nIn January 2007, Applicant considered purchasing a home. She completed a\nloan application and again became aware of her outstanding financial difficulties and her\ncredit history. This was only a few months before she completed her March 2007\nsecurity clearance application.\nWhen Applicant completed her March 12, 2007 application, she answered \u201cno\u201d to\nsection 23: Your Police Record (which asks about prior arrests) and \u201cno\u201d to section 28:\nYour Financial Delinquencies. Applicant explained that she had forgotten the 2001\narrest again. She had no reasonable reason for not answering \u201cyes\u201d to the question in\nsection 28(a) and (b) concerning the debts more than 90 or 180 days overdue (GE 1).\nShe was evasive at the hearing and inconsistent with her answers on cross\nexamination. She did not list the delinquencies because she did not want them to be a\npossible security concern. \nApplicant\u2019s current employer recommends Applicant for a security clearance. He\nreports she has excellent qualities and can be trusted. She is a dedicated worker. He is\naware of the security concerns facing Applicant, and believes she is resolving her\nfinancial problems. Applicant\u2019s recommendations include one from the acting pastor of\nher church and one from a friend (AE A-C).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\njudgments and did not meet her financial obligations from the late 1990's until the\npresent time. Her credit reports confirm that she has recent debts as well. The evidence\n\n6\nis sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 1999. She accumulated some delinquent debt due to her\nseparation. While those circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does\nnot end at that point. She has not acted responsibly. Her conduct over the last six\nmonths with her creditors does not remove security concerns or doubts about her\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She has 13 outstanding\ndelinquent debts. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, her\nfinancial problems initially arose from her separation, her illness and a period of\nunemployment. Although, she did receive disability payments and unemployment\nbenefits, those benefits were adequate for her to maintain payments on her debts. After\nshe became re-employed, she did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving these\ndebts. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling. She had an\nappointment in 2007 but did not keep the appointment. She paid some of debts and\njudgments in 2003, the tax in 2005, and has a payment plan for two debts. In light of her\n13 delinquent debts, her efforts are not sufficient to carry her burden in this case. I\nconclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant originally stated that\nshe disputed the car repossession as her debt because she thought her husband would\nmake payments on it. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\n\n7\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed her 2002 security application, she did not\nlist any delinquent debts, garnished pay, repossessions, judgments, or her 2001 arrest\nfor assault and battery. In her 2007 security application, she listed a repossession and\ngarnishment but did not list any delinquent accounts. She answered \u201cno\u201d to all the\nrelevant questions, and did not disclose the debts discussed in the previous section.\nHer explanations are not credible. She provided deliberately false information.\nMoreover, just a few months before the 2007 application, when looking for a house,\nApplicant was reminded of her financial problems when her credit was reviewed. Thus,\n16(a) applies.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns in this case. After considering them, none of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\n17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of her SF 86 in March 2007 is recent. She did not\npromptly inform the government of her falsification. Her interview in 2004 was two years\nafter her 2002 application. She did not receive counseling to improve her conduct. No\none advised her to falsify her SF 86. She admitted that she had no reason not to answer\nthe questions. The falsification of her SF 86 is substantiated. The falsification of her\n2007 SF 86 cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\n.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 31(a), an \u201csingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d may be potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly, under AG 31(c) an allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d may raise security concerns. As discussed above, Applicant intentionally\n\n8\nfalsified her security clearance applications. This is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions.\nWhile the falsifications in the 2002 are in the past, they have recurred as recently\nas 2007. Thus, none of the mitigating conditions apply and they are not sufficient to\nmitigate the disqualifying conduct. None of the mitigating conditions apply under this\nguideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has served in various positions with a\nsecurity clearance for a number of years. She has not had any documented problems\nwith her employment. Her current employer praises her hard work and professionalism.\nHowever, Applicant has a long history of financial difficulties and has resolved less than\nhalf of them.  Moreover, her recent falsification of her SF 86 in 2007 is a violation of\nFederal law under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, which is a felony. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations, personal conduct and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 10, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn August 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines E, F and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 22, 2008, and requested\nan Administrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 22, 2009. Applicant filed a\nresponse to the FORM on February 2, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February\n13, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn 2002, applicant was indicted for (1) Fraudulent Use of Identity and (2) Mail\nFraud. In 2003, she pleaded guilty to the first charge, and was sentenced to five years\nin prison (suspended), placed on five years reporting probation, and was ordered to pay\nrestitution. The second charge was dismissed.\nApplicant has 11 delinquent debts, totaling over $10,000.00. All 11 debts were\neither placed for collection or charged off in or before 2005.\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) in September 2006. She provided false material information in response to two\nquestions. Specifically, in response to Questions 28a and 28b, she denied that (1) in the\nprior seven years she had been over 180 days delinquent on any debt and (2) she was\nthen over 90 days delinquent on any debts. In fact, applicant was over 180 days\ndelinquent on all of the aforementioned debts. Applicant\u2019s false answers were clearly\nintentional.\nDuring a December 2006 interview with an OPM/DOD investigator, applicant\nintentionally provided the investigator with false material information when she stated\nshe was not involved in the 2002 crime discussed above, she did not have to report to a\nprobation officer, and she did not have to pay restitution.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\n\n3\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. Applicant has a long history of an inability or unwillingness to\npay her debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor her\nfinancial obligations is ongoing. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\npresented no credible evidence that would support application of this mitigating\ncondition.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. This  mitigation condition does not apply.\n\n4\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d This mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. Under\nParagraph 16.b., \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative\u201d may be disqualifying. In view of applicant\u2019s\nfalsification of material facts on the e-QIP, and during an interview with an OPM/DOD\ninvestigator, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nI reviewed the potentially mitigating factors under Guideline E and conclude none\napply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s 2003 conviction; and multiple falsifications of\nmaterial facts, which are felonies under 18 U.S.C. 1001, raise this disqualifying\ncondition.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\n5\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas a recent history of not honoring her financial obligations, dishonesty, and serious\ncriminal conduct. The little evidence she offered is insufficient to establish this conduct\nis unlikely to continue. She failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuidelines E, F and J.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 7 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 30, 2008). GE 7 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security clearance, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on May 21, 2008, and elected to \nhave her case decided without a hearing. Department Counsel requested a hearing \n(Transcript (Tr.) 14). At the hearing held on August 26, 2008, Department Counsel \noffered five exhibits (Government Exhibits (GEs) 1-5) (Tr. 18), and Applicant offered \nthree exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-C) (Tr. 20-21). There were no objections, and \nI admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-C (Tr. 18, 20-21). I received the transcript on September 9, \n2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted in her response to the SOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 26 years old.4 She graduated from high school and attended \ncosmetology school but did not graduate (Tr. 5). She does not currently hold a security \nclearance (Tr. 6). Her son is seven years old (Tr. 49). She is her son\u2019s sole provider (Tr. \n49). She has worked for a contractor for about two years, and she loves her job (Tr. 49). \nShe does not associate with people involved with drugs from her past (Tr. 49). Her \nclose friends, family members, and current boyfriend know about her drug problem, and \nher rehabilitation (Tr. 50). \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from approximately 1997 to October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nShe used cocaine at least once in high school around 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and she used \ncrack cocaine from about November 2002 to October 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). On July 7, \n2004, she was arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia because of \na drug pipe found in her car (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. 56). This charge was placed on the \u201cSTET\u201d \ndocket. Applicant believed that a STET disposition \u201cis on your record for a year and if \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GEs 4 (Responses to Interrogatories) and 8 (Response to \nSOR) are the sources for the facts in this section unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4GE 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated Sept. 20, 2006, will \nbe referred to as a security clearance application in this decision). GE 1 is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, and the next paragraph unless otherwise stated. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n[she] were to have another charge come up, they could bring that back up\u201d (Tr. 47). \nFrom October 28, 2004, to November 25, 2004, she received in-patient drug treatment \nin Maryland (SOR \u00b6 1.e). She received a diagnosis of cocaine dependence continuous \nand a good prognosis.       \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant disclosed she first used marijuana when she was 12 \nyears old (Tr. 51). She used crack cocaine, cocaine, marijuana, mushrooms \n(hallucinogenic mushrooms are also known as psilocybin or psilocin) and acid (lysergic \nacid diethylamide) (Tr. 51).5 She regularly used marijuana when she was 16 or 17 years \nold (Tr. 51). When she was 19 or 20 years old, she used cocaine for the first time in the \npowder form (Tr. 53). Later she smoked crack cocaine (Tr. 53-54). The frequency of her \ncrack cocaine consumption gradually increased until her use was daily (Tr. 54). \n \nApplicant recognized she was addicted to drugs (Tr. 45). She referred herself \ninto a 28-day, in-patient drug rehabilitation program in Maryland (Tr. 45, 48, 68). She \nreceived a diagnosis from a medical doctor of \u201cCocaine dependence continuous, \nPrognosis: Good\u201d (GE 5). She completed the program and decided to move into a \nhalfway house (Tr. 48). She left Maryland and went to Florida to get away from the drug \nenvironment and other drug users (Tr. 45-48, 69). She was determined to overcome her \ndrug problem, and left her son with her parents for 18 months so that she could focus \non beating her drug problem (Tr. 48). The last time she used any illegal drugs was in \nOctober 2004 (Tr. 52, 54, 57). \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Applications \n \nApplicant signed her security clearance application on September 20, 2006 (GE \n1), and incorrectly responded, \u201cNo\u201d to questions pertaining to previous criminal offenses \nand drug use.6  Section 23 of her security clearance application (GE 1) asked: \n \nSection 23: Your Police Record For this item, report information \nregardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or \n \n5Applicant said she used mushrooms on one occasion in June or July of 2000 (Tr. 55). Applicant \nsaid she used LSD on one occasion in 1998 (Tr. 55). She did not mention her LSD or mushroom use to \nthe OPM investigator because she was focused on the marijuana and cocaine use and did not think of it \n(Tr. 72-73). Mushrooms are the street name for psilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule (Sch.) I \nControlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, 351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a \nplant which may contain the Schedule I(c)(15) and I(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). \nLysergic acid diethylamide is a Sch. I controlled substance. See Schedule I(c)(9). See also 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812. \n \n6Applicant also denied in response to Section 23f of her security clearance application that she \nhad been arrested or charged with any other criminal offenses (excluding traffic offenses involving fines of \nless than $150). At her hearing, she disclosed that she was arrested and charged in 2004 with second \ndegree assault (Tr. 47). She contended the incident was self-defense in that she struck a man she was \ndating after her struck her (Tr. 47). He chipped her tooth, and she broke his nose (Tr. 47). The police \narrested both of them. However, he passed away before trial, and the charge was dropped (Tr. 48). The \nSOR did not allege that she failed to disclose this arrest and charge on her security clearance application. \nAt the hearing, the issue of her failure to disclose this information was not fully developed. I presume that \nshe did not disclose the assault arrest because the charge was subsequently dropped or dismissed.      \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \notherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this \nrequirement is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled \nSubstances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under \nthe authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. Answer the following \nquestions. . . . d. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any \noffense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?  \n \nSection 24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity The following \nquestions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. You are \nrequired to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your failure to do \nso could be grounds for an adverse employment decision or action against \nyou, but neither your truthful responses nor information derived from your \nresponses will be used as evidence against you in any subsequent \ncriminal proceeding.  Answer the following questions. a. Since the age of \n16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any \ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, \nhashish, \nnarcotics \n(opium, \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.), \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?    \n \nDuring a June 20, 2007, interview with an investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) Applicant disclosed her drug use as well as her arrest and charge \nof possession of drug paraphernalia (GE 4). Her description to the OPM investigator \nwas generally consistent with her statement at her hearing. She told the OPM \ninvestigator (GE 4) that she did not disclose her drug use for the following reasons: \n \nBecause a [co-worker] informed her that everyone has smoked marijuana; \nhe did not list it and he got his clearance. Subject also spoke with her \nparents about this and they advised her it was her personal choice to not \nlist any information regarding the arrest and drug involvement. Subject \nwas not afraid that she would not have gotten her clearance if she listed \nthe drug offense and involvement. Subject is not susceptible to blackmail \nor coercion, but admitted that she does not openly tell people about this \npart of her past. . . . She admitted that she did not list her drug \ninvolvement because she was scared and did not want anyone to find out \nabout it. Subject was afraid that she would not get her security clearance if \nshe listed this information because she knew that this was major, \nsignificant information.   \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she was aware her answers were wrong on her \nsecurity clearance application (Tr. 58-60). Applicant did not disclose her drug \nparaphernalia arrest and charge because she thought her record was clean and she did \nnot believe she was charged (Tr. 60-62). She said she did not believe she was ever \ncharged with possession of drug paraphernalia; but she subsequently learned from the \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nOPM investigator that she was charged (Tr. 62).7 Additionally, she did not disclose her \ndrug problems on her security clearance application because she \u201cwas thinking that it \nwas no one else\u2019s business. . . I wasn\u2019t ordered to go to this rehab so I figured I didn\u2019t \nneed to put it. It was behind me. I had moved on. I do realize it was wrong\u201d (Tr. 46). She \nconsulted with her parents,8 but did not consult with security personnel about \ncompletion of her security clearance application (Tr. 59). She did not consult security \nbecause, \u201c[She] was scared for them to know that [she] had been a drug addict[. So \nshe] chose to put no because it was from [her] past and [she] felt that [she] willingly \nwent to rehab and [she] didn\u2019t think that this was something that would be brought up.\u201d \n(Tr. 59). Applicant recognized she was wrong for not disclosing her drug problems on \nher security clearance application (Tr. 46). She has changed from the time of her drug \nabuse, and her environment has changed too (Tr. 73).   \n \nRecommendations \n \nIn August 2006, a contractor hired Applicant as a senior office aide and as \nreceptionist on the ground floor (Tr. 23-24). Applicant is the \u201cfirst line of defense\u201d for the \nsecurity program (Tr. 24, AE B). She registers visitors, and tracks foreign nationals who \nenter the facility (AE A). She reports to the facility security officer (FSO) (Tr. 23).  \nApplicant does not have a clearance, nor does she need a clearance to continue in her \npresent role (Tr. 31). The contractor wanted to expand her duties to encompass more \nsensitive security matters and for Applicant\u2019s career development (Tr. 31). Applicant will \nnot be fired if she fails to receive a clearance (Tr. 32). \n \nMs. D is the contractor\u2019s regional operations manager, and the person who hired \nApplicant (Tr. 23, 27, AE A). Ms. D supervised Applicant from August 2006 to January \n2007 (Tr. 23, 27, AE A). Ms. D described Applicant as diligent in the protection of \nsensitive information (Tr. 23, 27). After January 2007, Ms. D had indirect supervisory \nauthority over Applicant (Tr. 27), and has direct supervisory authority over the FSO (Tr. \n30). Ms. D opined that Applicant complies with all security protocols, and ensures that \nother employees likewise do so. She is always on time, and demonstrates a strong work \nethic (Tr. 24, AE A). Applicant\u2019s performance shows she is conscientious and \nresponsible in all areas of her duties (Tr. 23). Applicant loves her son and takes good \ncare of him (Tr. 25). Applicant is now fully aware of the necessity of full disclosure on \nher security clearance-related documents (Tr. 26). Ms. D recommends approval of \nApplicant\u2019s clearance (AE A).  \n \nMs. B, the contractor\u2019s FSO for the last four years, and Applicant\u2019s current \nsupervisor corroborated Ms. A\u2019s description of Applicant\u2019s duties and performance (Tr. \n34-44, AE B). She has daily, professional contact with Applicant (Tr. 39). Applicant has \n \n7Applicant was taken to the police station and \u201cbooked\u201d (Tr. 62). She was not simply given a ticket \nor citation to appear in court (Tr. 62-63). \n \n8Her parents advised her not to disclose her drug rehabilitation program because it was a self-\nreferral (Tr. 64). During her OPM interview, Applicant took a break and called her mother (Tr. 64). Her \nmother told her to be honest with the investigator (Tr. 65). After receiving this advice, she disclosed the \ninformation she had been withholding from the investigator (Tr. 65-66). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nexcellent judgment, and shows initiative (Tr. 35-37). When a problem arises she seeks \nassistance from Ms. B (Tr. 35-36). Applicant is open about her drug problem and what \nshe did to overcome and rehabilitate herself (Tr. 36). Applicant supports her community, \nher son and her fellow workers (Tr. 37, AE B).  She far exceeded expectations and is an \nexcellent employee (Tr. 37). Applicant did not disclose her drug charge on her security \nclearance application because the court indicated the offense was \u201cstet\u201d and she \nthought that meant cleared (Tr. 39-40). She did not disclose her drug use on her \nsecurity clearance application because she believed her drug use is a private matter \n(Tr. 40). The company provides guidance to employees that if they have questions \nabout completion of their security clearance application, they should send them to the \nsecurity coordinator or Ms. B (Tr. 41). Applicant did not ask Ms. B any questions about \nher security clearance application (Tr. 42). Ms. B believes Applicant\u2019s \u201cdiligence in \npromptly reporting concerns and adhering to required security policies and procedures \nwill ensure the integrity of national security\u201d (AE B). \n \nMr. O, Facilities Manger, has supervised Applicant since April 1, 2007 (AE C). \nApplicant is a reliable, dependable professional (AE C). She sets a fine example and \noften received compliments (AE C). She demonstrates attention to detail and is \nconscientious and highly organized (AE C).  She is a very valuable member of the team \n(AE C).   \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d9 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).10 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guidelines H (drug \ninvolvement) and E (personal conduct) with respect to the allegations set forth in the \nSOR. \n \n \n \n9See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances. See Sch. I (c)(9). See also Gonzales v. Raish, \n545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). Mushrooms are the street name for \npsilocybin or psilocin, which is a Schedule (Sch.) I Controlled Substance. See United States v. Hussein, \n351 F.3d 9, 16 (1st Cir. 2003) (mushrooms are a plant which may contain the Schedule I(c)(15) and \nI(c)(16) controlled substance psilocybin or psilocyn). Opium and cocaine are Schedule II Controlled \nSubstances. See Sch. II(a)(3) (opium); and Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine).   \n \n12AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d \u201cillegal drug possession,\u201d \n\u201cpossession of drug paraphernalia\u201d and diagnosis by a physician of drug dependence. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(d). The other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are \nnot applicable. These disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used marijuana, \ncocaine, and crack cocaine. She possessed these drugs before she used them. She \nalso possessed drug paraphernalia. On November 25, 2005, a physician diagnosed her \nwith continuous cocaine dependence (GE 5).   \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d13 \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was almost four years ago. AG \u00b6 26(a) fully applies \ndespite Applicant\u2019s last illegal drug use being relatively recent. Her overall illegal drug \nuse lasted approximately seven years (1997 to 2004), and involved numerous uses of \nmarijuana, and crack cocaine.14 AG \u00b6 26(a) applies because her drug use does not cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Because of her in-\npatient treatment and her time in a half way house, and her abstention from drug use for \nalmost four years, there is reasonable certitude that she will continue to abstain from \ndrug use. I am confident her illegal drug possession and use will not recur. Because she \nwill not use illegal drugs in the future, confidence in her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment is restored.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate her intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. She has disassociated from her drug-using associates and \ncontacts. She moved hundreds of miles from the location where she routinely abused \n                                            \n13 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an Administrative Judge stating: \n \nThe Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history \nof improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the \nsecurity clearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times \na year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the \nillegal purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n14In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the Administrative Judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse.  \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nillegal drugs, changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used. After \nthoroughly breaking her pattern of addiction, she returned to Maryland. However, she \ndid not renew her association with the drug abusing friends from her past. She has \nabstained from drug abuse for almost four years. However, she did not provide \u201ca \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d  AG \n\u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not applicable because her drug abuse did not follow an illness. The \ncocaine and marijuana were never prescribed for her.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is fully applicable. She satisfactorily completed a prescribed drug \ntreatment program, including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by medical doctor. See GE 5.  \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended her drug abuse in October 2004. The motivations \nto stop using drugs are evident.15 She understands the adverse results from drug \nabuse. She has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no drug abuse to \neliminate drug involvement as a bar to her access to classified information.  \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n15Retention of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free.  \n  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nApplicant failed to disclose her 2004 criminal possession of drug paraphernalia \narrest and charge, and her drug abuse from 1997 to October 2004 on her 2006 security \nclearance application (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nThe mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies to the allegation that she \nfalsified her answer to the question about her prior arrests and charges. Although she \nadmitted preparing her 2006 security clearance application and answering incorrectly on \nthis clearance document, she did not fully understood the requirement to provide the \ninformation the government sought. She was unaware of the responsibility to report her \nstet offense of possession of drug paraphernalia. She believed that with the charge or \narrest \u201cdismissed,\u201d it was gone and not reportable. She thought her police record was \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n\u201cclean\u201d for reporting purposes.16 I found her statement at the hearing to be credible. She \nhonestly thought the charges were gone and not reportable. Her statement shows \nconfusion about the requirement to disclose criminal/police record information. At the \ntime she provided this particular false information to security officials, she thought that \nthe answer she provided was permitted. She did not intend to violate the rules, and did \nnot have the necessary intent to establish the disqualifying conduct. Applicant has \nprovided sufficient information to unsubstantiate the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a.   \n \nThe allegation that she falsified her answer to Section 24 of her security \nclearance application is substantiated. She admitted preparing her 2006 security \nclearance application and answering Section 24 incorrectly. She provided false \ninformation for several reasons. One reason was because she was worried the \ngovernment might not approve her clearance if she disclosed her drug abuse and \nrehabilitation treatment. The allegation of deliberate falsification in SOR \u00b6 2.b is fully \nsubstantiated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n16The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of her clearance. Applicant \nrevealed her drug abuse to an OPM investigator on June 20, 2007, and at her hearing. I \nspecifically find her statements about her drug use and her description of the changes in \nher drug-abusing behavior to be credible. Applicant used illegal drugs from the age of \nabout 17 to about 22. She successfully completed a 29-day, in-patient drug treatment \nprogram, followed by lengthy treatment in a half way house. She no longer associates \nwith her drug-abusing friends. Now that she is in the workforce, the consequences of \ndrug abuse will be much more severe. She stopped using illegal drugs almost four \nyears ago. Through drug therapy, she knows the consequences if she resumes her \ndrug abuse. Applicant is a valued employee with excellent potential. There is no \nevidence at work of any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that \nshe would intentionally violate national security. Her law-abiding character and good \nwork performance shows some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. Her co-\nworkers and supervisors supported approval of her clearance. I am satisfied that her \ncurrent judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and her current ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules and regulations show solid future potential for access to \nclassified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant abused marijuana and/or cocaine from 1997 to October 2004. These serious \ndrug problems are fully mitigated for the reasons previous discussed. However, the \nfalsification of her security clearance application in September 2006 cannot be mitigated \nat this time. The falsification of her security clearance application was knowledgeable, \nvoluntary, and intentional. She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her \nconduct. Falsification of a security clearance application shows a lack of trustworthiness \nand poor judgment. Such conduct goes to the heart of the clearance process, and a \nsecurity clearance is not warranted at this time. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude she has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug \ninvolvement, but not personal conduct.    \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d17 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n17See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings as to SOR paragraphs 1(d), (g)-(k), (m), and (n) are not at issue on appeal.\n1\nDecision at 3.\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Brief at 1.\n3\nTranscript at 23.\n4\nDecision at 10.\n5\nId.\n6\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 8, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s factual findings are\nsupported by substantial evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision under\nGuideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred as to one of his findings of fact.  He also contends\nthat the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did not give sufficient weight\nto his mitigating evidence, which indicated that his financial problems resulted from the operation\nof a business and were unlikely to recur.  Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred in his\nfindings or that his decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that it was factual error for the Judge to find that: \u201cBecause he was\npassed over for promotion, the Army declined to accept him on active duty as a volunteer in 2001-\n2002.\u201d   Applicant claims that the erroneous finding demonstrates that the Judge failed to understand\n2\nthe distinguished nature of his military service.   The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\n3\nThe finding at issue is based upon Applicant\u2019s own testimony at the hearing: \u201c . . . when I\ntried to get back in, the Army said no, you\u2019re a lame duck.  Because you\u2019ve been passed over twice\nfor major, we won\u2019t take you back in.\u201d   The Judge did not appear to draw any pejorative inferences\n4\nfrom that testimony insofar as the distinguished nature of Applicant\u2019s military service was\nconcerned.  On the contrary, the Judge later noted in his decision that: \u201c . . . he is an honest, hard-\nworking employee, a good father, and patriot.  He is an honorable former Army officer.  I have no\ndoubt that he is loyal and would give his life for the United States.\u201d   The Judge then went on to base\n5\nhis adverse decision on the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial problems stating:\n\u201cNotwithstanding these positive attributes, he has not established his financial responsibility . . .\u201d6\n\nSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such\n7\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than\nthe weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620, (1966).\n\u201cApplicant learned of the security significance of his delinquent debt when he received the SOR, and did not\n8\nuse the next five months to address his six delinquent SOR debts.  He made no real progress in resolving these six\ndelinquent SOR debts.\u201d  Decision at 11.  \n3\nAccordingly, after reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the challenged finding is\nbased on substantial evidence,  or constitutes a reasonable characterization or inference that can be\n7\ndrawn from the record.  There is no record evidence that convinces the Board that, as regards his\nmilitary service, the Judge misconstrued Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony.  Applicant has not identified\nany harmful error likely to change the outcome of the case.  Considering the record evidence as a\nwhole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\n(2) The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had significant outstanding debts, and was\nstill trying to resolve his financial problems.   In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\n8\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant\nagainst the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of\nrelevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to several of the SOR allegations.\n However, he reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome all of\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo. The favorable\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).   \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\n\n4\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under\nGuideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.

GE 7 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nOctober 8, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.2 \n \nOn June 20, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a \nhearing (GE 8). On July 25, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held on \nAugust 21, 2008, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) \n26-27), and Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE A-B) (Tr. 29-30, 74). There were \nno objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-H (Tr. 27, 30, 74). Additionally, I \nadmitted the Hearing Notice (GE 6), SOR (GE 7), and Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR \n(GE 8). I received the transcript on September 8, 2008. I received additional \ndocumentation on September 23 and 24, 2008, and on October 6 and 8, 2008. I closed \nthe record on October 8, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, \n1.f, 1.i, 1.j and 1.l, with explanations (GE 8). He denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, \n1.k, 1.m and 1.n (GE 8). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact.4    \n \nApplicant is 43 years old (Tr. 5).5 In 1990, he received a bachelor of science \ndegree from a service academy (Tr. 6). He currently holds an interim secret clearance \n(Tr. 6). In 1994, he left active duty as a captain (Tr. 19). He wanted to become an \nentrepreneur (Tr. 19).

Immediately after the attack on September 11, 2001, he \nvolunteered to return to active duty (Tr. 20-21). While Applicant was in the IRR, the \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GE 8 (Response to SOR) is the source for the facts in this \nsection unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4There was no objection, and I approved admission of Applicant\u2019s opening statement as \nsubstantive evidence (Tr. 20). \n \n5GE 1 (2008 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. I accepted Applicant\u2019s opening statement as substantive evidence (Tr. 30). \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nArmy sent his personnel record before a promotion board to major (Tr. 22). He was \npassed over for promotion to major because he was not educationally qualified (he \nevidently had not completed his Captain\u2019s Career Course)(Tr. 22, AE A at 3-4). \nBecause he was passed over for promotion, the Army declined to accept him on active \nduty as a volunteer in 2001-2002 (Tr. 22-23). Applicant was honorably discharged from \nthe IRR in 2003 (Tr. 22).     \n \nApplicant assumed when he left active duty that he would be able to obtain a \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) loan (Tr. 32). He thought he could rely on his \nveteran\u2019s preference (Tr. 32). He learned he needed a positive cash flow for five years \nto qualify for an SBA loan (Tr. 32-33).   \n  \nApplicant ran a corporation from about 1996 to 2000 (Tr. 31). He was the sole \nshareholder of his corporation (Tr. 39). The corporation at one point had two employees \n(Tr. 66). The corporate product involved installation of back-up or standby power \nsystems (Tr. 31, AE A at 2). Most of his delinquent SOR debt was related to this \nbusiness (Tr. 31). He was proud of his business accomplishments, which did show \nsome success (Tr. 21). He did not consider his business endeavor to be reckless or ill-\nconceived (Tr. 33).  \n \nApplicant placed his corporate records into a storage unit; however, he was \nunable to pay the rent for his storage (Tr. 35). The storage company disposed of his \nrecords (Tr. 35, 66). He did not have corporate tax records or filings (Tr. 66). He said \nthe landlord/creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d, who was seeking payment of rent was fully \naware the debt was corporate (Tr. 37). Applicant explained: \n \n. . . they\u2019re fully aware that this was a corporate debt, but because they \nknow my name and they know how to put something on my credit report, \nthey put it on the credit report. I don\u2019t think it should legitimately be there. \nBut\u2014you know\u2014that\u2019s a battle I haven\u2019t fought. \n \n(Tr. 37). When the corporation failed, he made no effort to pay his debts, he just \u201cwalked \naway from the business\u201d (Tr. 40). He did not take action to officially disband the \nbusiness (Tr. 40). Up to the time of his hearing, he had not contacted the creditors to \nobtain information linking the debt to his prior corporation (Tr. 38-39). He did not contact \nthe creditors to protest the debts (Tr. 38). He did research the landlord\u2019s debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d), but was unable to locate any record about the current existence of the creditor (Tr. \n38). Applicant has not declared bankruptcy, and his corporation did not declare \nbankruptcy (Tr. 39). \n \nIn 2000, Applicant obtained employment with a contractor, providing support to \nthe Army (Tr. 20). His initial salary was about $80,000 per year (Tr. 41). His gross salary \nis now about $120,000 per year (Tr. 42). He has developed substantial expertise and \nacquired specialized, institutional knowledge (Tr. 25). The military personnel frequently \nturnover and he has worked loyally to help the Army in his area of specialization (Tr. \n26). His work on behalf of the Army is valuable (Tr. 25). \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant married twice and has four children and one step-child (Tr. 42). He is \npaying child support for five children (Tr. 43). His children range in age from five to 15 \n(Tr. 83). His first marriage failed because of financial pressure from his business (Tr. \n80). His second marriage failed because his spouse was a violent alcoholic (Tr. 81). \nApplicant said he worked out a budget but was unable to afford to pay his delinquent \ndebts for his business (Tr. 44). After his hearing he provided the following budget \ninformation (Tr. 45; AE E at 15):  wages after taxes: $5,890 and expenses $5,204 (rent: \n$1,000; auto: $480; child support: $2,200; food: $500; clothing: $100; transportation: \n$450; insurance: $50; telephone: $29; internet: $50; debt payments: $300; and storage: \n$45). After tax income minus expenses equals $686.    \n \n  \nAlthough Applicant did not have documentation to establish the existence of his \ncorporation at his hearing (Tr. 34), he subsequently provided documents establishing \nthe corporation\u2019s existence (AE E at 4-11).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts, totaling about $29,000.

I explained to Applicant that he needed to provide \nrecords proving the corporation owed the debts rather than Applicant personally or he \nwould lose his clearance (Tr. 67, 69-71, 74-75). I told him to go to the creditors and get \ncopies of the documents showing he owed the debts (Tr. 67-75). He said he understood \n\n \n \n5 \n \nwhat was required, and he agreed to request documentation to establish the corporate \nresponsibility for his debts (Tr. 68-70, 75-79). On September 21, 2008, Applicant wrote \nletters requesting records from the court that approved the three judgements in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a (AE H at 9), 1.b (AE H at 9) and 1.d (AE H at 10). On September 21, 2008, he wrote \nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e (AE H at 13), 1.i (AE H at 12) and 1.l (AE H at 11) asking for \ncase documentation.  The five letters in AE H 9-13 did not dispute or contest the validity \nof any of the SOR debts. \n \nIn his response to DOHA interrogatories, he said his corporation owed the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d (GE 3 at 2). For other debts, he said he incurred the debt \u201cfor the \npurpose of operating\u201d his corporation (GE 3 at 2-6). In an email dated October 3, 2008, \nApplicant elaborated on the issue of whether his remaining unresolved debts were \ncorporate as opposed to personal stating: \n \nIn order to be granted unsecured loans/lines of credit and contracts, such \nas facility and truck leases for [my corporation], it was often necessary for \nme to provide my SSN as the corporate officer and place my personal \ncredit at risk for the purpose of starting and operating the company. I \nalways tried to secure resources using the corporation first and only \nresorted to placing my personal credit at risk as a last resort. \n \n[The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d] certainly did know that I was running a \ncorporation right down the hall in the same building as their business \nheadquarters.  Hence, the directory that they placed on their wall [included \nthe name of my corporation]. \n \n[The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.l] would not lease [my corporation] a truck unless \nI, as the corporate officer, also placed my own credit rating at risk. I first \ntried to use only the corporation, but that request was denied. \n \nMonthly statements for other unsecured loans/lines of credit were \naddressed to both my name and [my corporation\u2019s name] and sent to [my \nhome address]. \n \nApplicant concluded his statement, succinctly explaining why he was not a \nsecurity risk: \n \nI served my country with distinction while in the Army.  I have been \nworking as an Army contractor since August 2000.  I have held an Interim \nSecret Clearance since July 2004.  My job performance has been superior \nand I am providing a high value service to the USA in my current career \nposition.  I have never and will never take any action that would place the \nUSA's security at risk.  I am willing to die in the service of the USA and \nthat is why I am a confirmed volunteer for the current operation. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                           \nRecommendations and Character Materials \n \n \nApplicant completed airborne, air assault and flight training (AE B at 10, 11 and \n15-17). He completed several other military training courses. He volunteered in his \ncommunity (AE B at 14). He was selected for captain in 1994 (AE B at 21). He received \nseveral letters and certificates of training, commendation and appreciation while on \nactive duty (AE B at 11-25). He was awarded the Good Conduct Medal (AE B at 23), \nand two awards of the Army Commendation Medal (AE B at 24, 25). Applicant\u2019s officer \nevaluation reports contained very positive statements about his leadership, dedication \nand integrity (AE B at 1-9, AE E at 16-25, 40-41, 43-50).6 He often received \u201ctop block\u201d \nevaluations in his senior rater\u2019s profile (AE E at 16-25).  \n \nAn Army brigadier general gave Applicant a note lauding him for his hard work on \nan important Army project (Tr. 24). Applicant did a \u201csuper job\u201d making an important \npresentation about the project for an Army major general and a civilian (Tr. 24). The \nbrigadier general emphasized Applicant\u2019s exceptional hard work and diligence (Tr. 24-\n25). His evaluations as a contractor showed outstanding service and contributions (AE \nB at 27-28). \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n6 Some of the documentation in AE B and E is duplicated.  \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n \n7 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n8 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his or her burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his credit reports (GE 4-5), his response to DOHA interrogatories \n(GE 3), and his SOR response (GE 8). However, I am satisfied that he paid the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($37), 1.k ($735) and 1.m ($100). The creditor waived collection of any debt \nowed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j (AE I). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($118) is not established. The \nissue of delinquent debt owed to six creditors remains for resolution. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve six delinquent \nSOR debts. Applicant has not shown any significant progress resolving his six \ndelinquent debts totaling about $22,000. His financial problems are not isolated. The \nongoing nature of his delinquent debts is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \n\n \n \n9 \n \n                                           \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment.\u201d He has been paying his non-SOR debts. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he \nreceives partial mitigation because his financial situation was damaged through his \ndivorces and he has a heavy child support burden of $2,400 per month. However, he \ndid not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his six delinquent debts.9 He \nadmitted that he has not maintained contact with these six creditors, and made no \nrecent efforts to set up payment plans or otherwise resolve these six debts.    \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have limited application. Applicant did not disclose \nfinancial counseling. There are some indications that \u201cthat the problem is being resolved \nor is under control\u201d because the amount of delinquent debt is not that large, and there is \nno new delinquent debt. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant \nshowed good faith10 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) mitigates his debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h. Although he did not \nprovide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\u201d with respect to \nthese debts, I will give him credit for mitigating them. The creditor waived collection of \nany debt owed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j (AE I). I found him to be credible concerning these \ndebts. He was unable to locate the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and as such was unable to \npay this debt. The Government did not provide a current address for the creditor in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d. Applicant returned the equipment and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h is minor at $94. I will \nfind \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j in the decretal paragraph \nof this decision.   \n \n9\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to six delinquent debts casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His six remaining \ndelinquent SOR debts total about $22,000 and likely will remain at that level for the \nforeseeable future. He is unable to come to terms and accept full responsibility for these \ndebts because of their connection to his defunct corporation. Nevertheless, he is an \nhonest, hard-working employee, a good father, and patriot. He is an honorable former \nArmy officer. I have no doubt that he is loyal and would give his life for the United \nStates. Notwithstanding these positive attributes, he has not established his financial \nresponsibility and that he has the judgment necessary to hold a security clearance. \nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating \nconditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. He is not financially sophisticated. He did not seem to understand that \nhe is financially responsible for the debts his corporation incurred because he agreed in \ncontracts that he was personally liable for those debts. His dedication to his children \nfrom his previous marriages is a very positive indication of his good character and \ntrustworthiness. He is a patriot and is completely loyal to his country. Applicant\u2019s record \nof good employment, and strong military record weighs in his favor. There is no \nevidence of any security violation. His non-SOR debts are current and being paid.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines is not sufficient to warrant a clearance at this time. The overall amount of his \ndelinquent debts at about $22,000 is substantial. He has been aware of his delinquent \ndebts since 2000. He has done little to address his six still delinquent debts and did not \n\n \n \n11 \n \npromise to pay these debts. Applicant learned of the security significance of his \ndelinquent debt when he received the SOR, and did not use the next five months to \naddress his six delinquent SOR debts. He made no real progress in resolving these six \ndelinquent SOR debts. His handling of his six delinquent SOR debts shows lack of \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.c: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i to 1.k:  \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. Findings of Fact The Applicant was 55 at the time of the hearing and single. He is employed by a Defense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with explanations in support of his request for access to classified information. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise of poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant. The Applicant was born in China in 1952. His mother has passed away from breast cancer in 1992. His father, his brother and sister continue to live in China. The Applicant has visited China annually from the year 2000 to 2007. His father\u2019s health is poor, which is the primary reason he travels to China. No one in his family works for the Chinese government. In addition to his trips, the Applicant calls his father once or twice a month. (Transcript at 42-45, 90-94; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F.) The Applicant came to the United States in 1986 to continue his education. He obtained his permanent resident status in 1991. The Applicant became a naturalized 3 American citizen in 1996.

On April 28, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nto the Applicant, which detailed security concerns under Guideline B stating why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether\na clearance should be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \n\n2\nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 9, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 4, 2008.  This case was assigned to me on June 6, 2008.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August\n15, 2008. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received\nwithout objection. The Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through V.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the record\nclosed, on August 27, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural Ruling\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). (Transcript at 21-23.)\nThe request and the allied documents were not admitted into evidence, but are included\nin the record.  The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general\nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute.  The facts administratively noticed\nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant was 55 at the time of the hearing and single.  He is employed by a\nDefense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment\nin the defense industry.  In his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the\nallegations in the SOR, with explanations in support of his request for access to\nclassified information. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has foreign contacts and interests that could lead to the exercise\nof poor judgment, unreliability or untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nThe Applicant was born in China in 1952.  His mother has passed away from\nbreast cancer in 1992.  His father, his brother and sister continue to live in China.  The\nApplicant has visited China annually from the year 2000 to 2007.  His father\u2019s health is\npoor, which is the primary reason he travels to China.  No one in his family works for the\nChinese government.  In addition to his trips, the Applicant calls his father once or twice\na month.  (Transcript at 42-45, 90-94; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F.) \nThe Applicant came to the United States in 1986 to continue his education.  He\nobtained his permanent resident status in 1991.  The Applicant became a naturalized\n\n3\nAmerican citizen in 1996.  He has worked in the Defense industry since 1997.  He has\nheld a security clearance for that entire period.\nWhen his mother died in 1992, the Applicant was living in the United States.  He\ncould not travel back to China to be with his mother because the Chinese government\nhad not renewed his Chinese passport.  This was due to his involvement in a protest\noutside the Chinese Embassy in Washington in 1989, during the Tien-An-Men Square\nStudent Protest Movement period.  (Transcript at 56-59; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.) \nHis involvement with this protest was not the first time the Applicant has had\nissues with the Chinese government.  The Applicant\u2019s entire family was affected by the\n\u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d of the 1950s and the \u201cCultural Revolution\u201d that swept China in the\n1960s.  During the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d the Applicant and his family nearly starved.\n(Transcript at 54; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B at 3.)  During the \u201cCultural Revolution,\u201d the\nApplicant and his siblings were exiled to different remote, poor, rural areas to work with\nthe local peasants.  He did that for two years, then he worked in a factory while\ncontinuing to do his studies.  During this same period, the Applicant\u2019s father was sent to\na labor camp and his mother was accused of being a Taiwanese spy because she had\na brother living there.  Because of all the things that happened to his family over the\nyears, the Applicant submits that he has zero sense of loyalty to the Chinese\ngovernment.  (Transcript at 59-66, 88-90; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 9, and Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits I and K.)\nOn the other hand, the Applicant submits that he has long-standing relationships\nand loyalties to the United States.  He is fully integrated into American society, and\nappreciates the life that he has here.  At page 4, paragraph (2) of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B\nhe eloquently sets forth the differences between his life in China and that of his life here.\nIn particular, he stated, \u201cIn 1996 after I became a U.S. citizen, I voted for the U.S.\npresident and congress men. That was a very exciting moment when the first time in my\nlife I had the right to vote and select my leaders.\u201d  (See Transcript at 56.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s entire professional career has been spent in the Defense\nindustry.  He is acknowledged to be an expert in his field of expertise, and his direct\ncontributions to the defense of the United States have been many and varied.  His\ncareer is filled with awards and recognitions from his employers and the Federal\ngovernment.  He is knowledgeable about the security requirements connected to his job\nin the defense industry, and the record shows that he fulfills them.  (Transcript at 66-80;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits L through T.)  His most recent employee evaluation was very\nlaudatory and stated that he has the potential to rise to one of the highest levels in his\ncompany.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit T.)\nThe Applicant has considerable assets in the United States.  As of the date the\nrecord closed, his net assets amounted to approximately $1,000,000.  (Transcript at 37-\n39; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  He has no assets in China whatsoever.\n\nAll of the following statements are supported by the documents submitted by the Department Counsel in\n1\nsupport of his request for administrative notice.  (Administrative Notice Documents I through VI.)\n4\nThe Applicant submits that the Government\u2019s own documents show that he is not\nan individual the Chinese government would attempt to influence.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibit U\nis an extract from the \u201cIntelligence Threat Handbook.\u201d  This same extract is cited by the\nGovernment in their administrative notice document Roman numeral II.  The Applicant\nstates at page 9 of Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B: \nAs stated in page 22 of this document [Applicant\u2019s Exhibit U]: \u201cThe crux of\nthe PRC\u2019s [People\u2019s Republic of China] approach is not to try to exploited\n(sic) a perceived vulnerability but to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help\nChina out in some way.\u201d  In general, the Chinese intelligence service may\nprefer to appeal to young students who may [n]ot know the brutality of the\ngovernment, or who may have been benefited (sic) from the government\nsuch as government employees and the children and relatives of the\ncentral and local government leaders and authorities.  I and my family\nwere victims of this government.  How could you think we have the desire\nto help this government out?\nThe Applicant is fully aware of the security issues involving his traveling to China.\nHis employers have always been notified of his trips in advance, he has reviewed the\napplicable and available security videos, and he files the appropriate after action\nreports.  (Transcript at 84-87.)  He is very discrete when he visits China, spending most\nof his time with his ill father.  (Transcript at 45, 52.)  Though it has little if any weight, the\nApplicant also repeatedly stated that if the Government believes his trips are not in the\nnational interest, he would stop visiting China.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 3.)  \nThe Applicant has contacts with China.  Accordingly, it is appropriate to discuss\nthe relationship between China and the United States at this time.   China, the most\n1\npopulous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an important trading\npartner of the United States.  It is run by the Communist Party which controls all aspects\nof the Chinese government.  It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.\nAlthough there has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the\nUnited States in the past.  China has an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense\nestablishment, and space capability.  China has launched satellites, has ballistic\nmissiles, nuclear arms, and nuclear bombs.  Its diplomatic and military dispute with the\nRepublic of China (Taiwan), foreshadows a possible military conflict, which the United\nStates opposes as a resolution of the conflict.  China has an abysmal human rights\nrecord, which includes arbitrary killings; detention or incarceration without notice in\nmental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no right to a public, fair trial;\na politically controlled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free speech, on\nreligious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of\nprivacy - family, home or correspondence. \n\n5\nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive\nnetwork of businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced\nU.S. military technology. One approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel\nfrom government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military industries,\nindependently of the PRC intelligence services.  This is believed to be the major method\nof PRC intelligence activity in the United States.  It also tries to identify ethnic Chinese\nin the United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes is able to\nenlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.   However, I also note\nthe following in administrative notice document Roman numeral II at 21, \u201cThere is no\nevidence that the PRC considers Chinese-Americans to be more vulnerable to\napproach than any other group.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant has family members in China (Guideline B).  The Applicant,\non the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe concern under Guideline B is styled as follows:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.\n\n7\nIn this case, Applicant has contact with his remaining family in China.\nSpecifically, his father, brother and sister.  The Applicant has traveled annually to China\nsince the year 2000.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following\nDisqualifying Conditions apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member .\n. . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and (b)\nconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information. \nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following\nMitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:\n8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nThe Applicant is a person who has shown over an extensive period of years his\nconnections to the United States and his desire to be not only a good citizen, but a\nsecurity aware citizen.  It is to his benefit that the Applicant shows an appreciation of the\npossible activities of the Chinese government.  This is shown by his affirmative acts to\nmake sure that his travels to China are appropriate, and his conduct when there.  The\nevidence shows that he is discrete and prudent.  \nThe Applicant has extensive financial ties to the United States.  In addition, he is\na deeply respected member of the Defense industry, who makes a substantial income.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, the Applicant has shown that he has deep and\nlongstanding loyalties in the United States.  Based on my analysis of the facts, including\na consideration of the espionage activities of the Chinese government, I find that the\nApplicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006).\n2\nI conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of the Applicant\u2019s security\n3\nclearance.  Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines that the mitigating conditions\narticulated under Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and (b) do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I find\nthat the whole person analysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this\ncase.\n\u201c[Matters], such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\n4\nties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country, his or her social ties within the U.S., and many others\nraised by the facts of a given case can properly be factored in to a judge\u2019s evaluation of an applicant\u2019s\nworthiness for a security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5, 2007).  (Citations\nomitted.)\n8\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\u201c[A] Judge is not limited to Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions when\ndeciding whether an applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.\u201d   The\n2\napplication of the Directive\u2019s General Factors to the Applicant\u2019s foreign connections,\nspecifically relevant General Factor (8), also justifies granting the Applicant a security\nclearance.  The totality of this Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at\nlength above, including the virtually non-existent potential for exploitation, shows that he\nwarrants a favorable finding under the whole person standard.3\n  \nThe record shows that the Applicant has been a patriotic American citizen for\nmany years, and has substantial financial assets in the United States.  His immediate\nfamily lives in China, but the evidence shows that they have no love for the Chinese\ngovernment, and he would successfully withstand any hypothetical attempt at coercion.\nThe Applicant is alert to the security concerns presented by his particular circumstances\nand the responsibilities incumbent upon him.  The Applicant testified about his pride in\nbeing an American citizen and a member of the defense industry.  Using the whole\nperson standard, the Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his foreign\nconnections and is eligible for a security clearance.4\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer Technician IV and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admits fifty-four of the fifty-five debts set forth in the SOR under this guideline. These debts were incurred between 1996 and the present, and total approximately $20,000.00. Each of the debts are reflected in the Applicant\u2019s Credit Reports dated January 31, 2008, January 13, 2009 and May 4, 2009. (Government Exhibits 5, 6 and 7). Even the smaller debts remain owing. Applicant testified that he has recently tried to re-establish himself with his creditors by trying to pay them what he could afford. (Tr. p. 33). He contends that all of these debts were incurred as a result of financial hardship and not extravagant spending. (Tr. p. 39).

(Government Exhibit 1).  On November 7, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 7, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on January 22, 2009.  A notice of hearing was originally issued on\nFebruary 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 27, 2009.  The matter was\ncontinued based upon a scheduling conflict.  An amended notice of hearing was issued\non February 23, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 3, 2009.  Applicant requested a\nsecond continuance based upon good cause that was granted.  An amended notice of\nhearing was issued on February 26, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 10, 2009.\nDue to difficulties with the court reporting contract, per agency instruction, the hearing\nwas continued.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 11, 2009, scheduling the\n\n2\nhearing for April 10, 2009.  Applicant requested a continuance based upon good cause\nthat was granted.  Based upon Applicant\u2019s medical reasons, another continuance was\ngranted.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for\nMay 5, 2009.  At the hearing, the Government offered seven exhibits, referred to as\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant\noffered no exhibits, but testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until\nclose of business on May 19, 2009, to allow the Applicant to submit  documentation on\nhis behalf.  Applicant failed to submit any additional documentation.  The transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) was received on May 14, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 35 years old and has an Advanced Technical Certificate in\nComputer Technology.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer\nTechnician IV and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).

Even the smaller debts remain owing.  Applicant testified that he\nhas recently tried to re-establish himself with his creditors by trying to pay them what he\ncould afford.  (Tr. p. 33).  He contends that all of these debts were incurred as a result\nof financial hardship and not extravagant spending.  (Tr. p. 39).    \nThe Applicant explained that he and his wife had their first child in 1997, at a very\nyoung age.  They were young, naive and did not handle their money correctly.  (Tr. p.\n27).  His first child, a son, was born with a disability, known as \u201cAsperger\u2019s Austism\u201d.\nThis condition caused them to incur medical debt that they did not expect.  Medi-cal\nonly covers between 60 to 80 percent of his son\u2019s medical expenses.  (Tr. p. 70).  The\nApplicant is responsible for the rest.  \nIn 1998, while the Applicant was working a menial job, he injured his back on the\njob.  This caused more unexpected medical bills.  In December 1999, he was placed on\n\n3\nworkers compensation for three years due to his injury.  (Tr. p. 30).  The injury to his\nlower spine ultimately required that he have a back fusion.  It was financially difficult to\nsupport his family, but they managed.  \nIn December 3, 2002, the Applicant was allowed to go back to work.  By this\ntime, he and his wife had three children.  They continued to struggle financially.  In\n2005, the Applicant began working for his current employer.  Since then, he has not\nbeen able address his delinquent debts.  \nTwo years ago, the Applicant underwent extensive medical testing for cancer and\nHIV, and it was determined that he had a serious infection in his lymph nodes.  This\ncaused him to be hospitalized and lose 67 pounds in a matter of six weeks.  (Tr. p. 37).\nHe incurred more unexpected medical bills and caused him to fall deeper in debt.        \nRecently, the Applicant\u2019s wife underwent a hysterectomy.  This caused more\nunexpected medical bills.  Despite this, the Applicant recently took out a loan against his\n401(k), known as a \u201chardship loan\u201d in the amount of $7,084.00, in order to address\nsome of his delinquent debts.  (Tr. p. 38).  He has been diligently contacting each of his\ncreditors and setting up payment plans within his budget to pay his debt.     \nApplicant testified that he would never do anything to jeopardize the\nGovernment, his country, his job, or the national security.  (Tr. p. 45).\nDue to his son\u2019s medical condition, his wife does not work outside of the home.\nApplicant now earns approximately $51,000.00 annually.  (Tr. p. 33).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n\n4\n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19.(e) consistent spending beyond ones means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\n\n5\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  It is recognized and I sympathize with the Applicant\u2019s history of\ncontinual medical problems in the family that have been the main cause of his financial\nproblems.  Particularly, unexpected medical bills brought on by his son\u2019s Asperger\nAutism, his three year period on disability with his back, his lymph node infection and\nhis wive\u2019s recent hysterectomy, have all been contributing factors to his financial\ndemise.  Not to mention the fact that, prior to his current employment, he worked menial\njobs that did not pay well.  Since 2005, he states that he has demonstrated outstanding\nwork performance on the job.  He also states that he has been promoted and given a\nwage increase on a consistent basis.  In order to resolve his past due indebtedness, he\nstates that he has recently taken out a hardship loan against his 401(k) and is hoping to\n\n6\npay some of his delinquent debt.  At the present time, however, he has failed to present\nany documentary evidence to support his testimony. He has failed to demonstrate that\nhe has been able to address any of his delinquent debts.  Furthermore, the Applicant\nwas given the opportunity to provide some documentary evidence, such as medical\nrecords for those effected family members, letters of recommendation from supervisors\nand coworkers and performance evaluations, to name a few.  The record remained\nopen after the hearing for two weeks for receipt of such documentation.  The Applicant\nfailed to submit any documentation.  Under the circumstances, he has not made a good\nfaith effort to resolve his indebtedness, and there is insufficient evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  The Applicant has not demonstrated that he can properly handle his\nfinancial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation apply.  However, Mitigating Condition 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances applies but is not\nsufficient to mitigate the extent of his indebtedness.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, and it does not sufficiently\nmitigate the adverse information brought against him.  On balance, it is concluded that\nthe Applicant has not overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n7\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst  the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst  the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.y.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.z.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.aa.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.bb.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.cc.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.dd.: Against the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.ee.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.ff.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.gg.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.hh.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.ii.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.jj.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.kk.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.ll.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.mm.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.nn.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.oo.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.pp:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.qq:    For the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.rr.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.ss.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.tt.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.uu.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.vv.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.ww.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.xx.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.yy.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.zz.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.aa.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.bb.: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.cc.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old test supervisor for a defense contractor with 11 technicians working for him at 15 test stations that are considered classified because of the test data that is inputted on them. He attended a community college and has an associate\u2019s degree. He served in the Navy for 21 years and was discharged in 2001 as an E-7. He has held a security clearance during and since his military service for a total of 28 years (Exh. F). He has worked for his present employer and the former owner since his discharge from the Navy.

Applicant was briefed on his duties by the ISSM when he was named ISSO and given some additional training. The total training given to Applicant is detailed at Exh. 32 (a-p). His staff of technicians was also given annual training. After several of the staff violations occurred, Applicant requested the ISSM to provide training every six months.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nOn December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline K Handling Protected Information. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n            Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 22, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 10, \nDecember 18, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 20, 2008, for a hearing on August 12, \n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through \n32, which were received without objection. The exhibits include many government and \ncorporate documents relating to requirements imposed by the National Industrial \nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) (Exhs. 4 and 5), and the implementation \nof those documents by the corporate employer.  \n \n            Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Exhibits A-L which were \nadmitted without objection. An index for both sets of documents was submitted and \nappended to each one. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 20, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            Applicant is a 46-year-old test supervisor for a defense contractor with 11 \ntechnicians working for him at 15 test stations that are considered classified because of \nthe test data that is inputted on them. He attended a community college and has an \nassociate\u2019s degree. He served in the Navy for 21 years and was discharged in 2001 as \nan E-7. He has held a security clearance during and since his military service for a total \nof 28 years (Exh. F). He has worked for his present employer and the former owner \nsince his discharge from the Navy. The allegations center around a series of security \nincidents involving his staff of technicians and three in which he solely was a participant.  \n \n            Sometime in early 2003, Applicant was given the additional duty of Information \nSystems Security Officer (ISSO) for his group. Applicant was briefed on his duties by \nthe ISSM when he was named ISSO and given some additional training. The total \ntraining given to Applicant is detailed at Exh. 32 (a-p). His staff of technicians was also \ngiven annual training. After several of the staff violations occurred, Applicant requested \nthe ISSM to provide training every six months. His request was granted (Tr. 103).  \n \n            At the time the additional duties were assigned, Applicant was working ten hours \na day and weekends on a rush project for a customer of his employer (Tr. 25 and 186). \nDuring the next three years or until July 2006 a number of security incidents occurred \nwhich are the subject of five of the allegations in the SOR. These incidents were \ncommitted by one or more of the eleven members of the technical staff whom he \nsupervised. Applicant and the violators were both held responsible. Applicant was \ncounseled, given written warnings, and, for the last incident, suspended for three days \nwithout pay. All of these incidents are SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 (a., b., d., e., and g.)). \nTwo other violations occurred (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 (c. and f.)) for which he was personally \ninvolved and admits in his answer. \n \n            The security incidents by Applicant\u2019s staff were as follows: \n \n1. Unauthorized use of another employee\u2019s password in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1 (a)) \n(Exh. 7); \n \n            2. Improper installation of software in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1 (b));  \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \n           3. Improper access to test station in May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1 (e.)) (Exh. 26);  \n \n4. A trusted down-loading incident (taking unclassified information from a \nclassified work station) on March 3, 2006, (SOR \u00b6 1 (d)) (Exh. 25); and, \n  \n5. A second incident involving trusted downloading by an employee who had not \nbeen trained to do so occurred on July 27, 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1 (g)) (Exh. 28).  \n \n           Applicant observed the May 2006 violation and reported it to his superiors. Both \nApplicant and the staff member were reprimanded (Tr.45-47). Applicant also advised \nthe employee in the July 2006 incident that he was not qualified to do downloading and \nsuggested others who should do it for him. However, the employee ignored his \nApplicant\u2019s instruction and did it himself (Tr. 49). After the second trusted downloading \nincident by his staff members in 2006, Applicant\u2019s ISSO duties were terminated later in \nthe year (Exh. 28).  \n \n           According to the Master System Security Plan adopted by Applicant\u2019s company \n(Exh. 11), the Information System Security Manager (ISSM) \u201chas the oversight \nresponsibility for the development, implementation, and evaluation of the facility\u2019s IS \nSecurity Program.\u201d The ISSM appoints and delegates certain responsibilities to an ISSO \n(Exhs. 10 and 11). The company had a classified test station which consisted of a \nseries of classified computers in a secured area. Everyone who worked in the area had \na clearance. It was the responsibility of the ISSM to set up the initial user accounts and \naccess privileges.  \n \n           The first alleged security violation for which Applicant admits responsibility (SOR \n\u00b61 (c)) was in October 29, 2005, when he failed to properly set an alarm in a protected \narea as he left the building (Exh. 24). The alarm should have buzzed when operational \nbut it did not. He left the building before making certain that it was properly set. He was \ngiven a written warning. The alarm system had created problems for others as well as \nfor him according to his supervisor (Exh. B). The protected area of the building was \nlocked and no compromise of security or tampering was discovered (Exh. 24 p. 2). \n \n           The second alleged security violation for which Applicant admits responsibility \n(SOR \u00b61 (f)) occurred on June 26, 2006, (Exh. 27) when he was called by one of his \nstaff on an unsecure phone while he was on the way to the airport at the beginning of a \nweekend. The employee needed access to a classified safe. Applicant gave him the \ncombination over the phone but advised him to have the combination immediately \nchanged. However, the staff member did not follow his instruction and waited until the \nfollowing Monday morning to have the combination changed. The incident was recorded \nin Applicant\u2019s personnel file for 18 months, and he and his staff member were required \nto re-take safe responsibility training. He was also given a written warning for incident.  \n \n           The last alleged incident in which Applicant was personally involved was on \nMarch 19, 2007, eight months after his ISSO duties were terminated (SOR \u00b61 (i)) (Exh. \n29). A security audit by a Defense Security Service representative found six unmarked \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nmedia disks on Applicant\u2019s desk and, according to the SOR, approximately 75 \nunmarked media disks on a shelf behind his desk. Applicant believed there were only a \ntotal of 50. The security incident report on this matter indicated confusion as to the \nextent of markings on the disks and the location of the disks at issue (Exh. 3, p. 6).  \n \n            All the disks had been in the possession of a former employee who recently \ndied. Applicant was asked by his manager to review the disks, all of them unmarked, \nand determine whether classified material was on them. This was an extra duty which \nhe had been doing over a three month period as of July 2007. He had reviewed the \ndisks on the shelf which were in a box marked \u201cunclassified\u201d and determined that there \nwas no classified information on any of them, but had not affixed individual markings on \nthe disks. He had not reviewed the six disks on his desk and they were unmarked. For \nthis incident he was suspended without pay for five days and removed from supervisory \nresponsibility for classified information (Tr. 82-100).  \n \n            Counsel for Applicant contended at the hearing that the failure to apply markings \nwas not a violation of corporate regulations or of Section 4-212 of the NISPOM (Exh. 4). \nThat section provides that wholly unclassified material need not be marked unless two \nconditions apply. There was no evidence submitted at the hearing to show that those \nconditions were applicable. A contra corporate position of the ISSM appears in the \nrecord that indicates all disks must be individually marked whether classified or \nunclassified (Exh. 29).  \n \n            An Administrative Inquiry was conducted in 2006 by the Defense Security \nService concerning the incidents that had occurred as of that time. A report was issued \non August 23, 2006 (Exh. 2) finding a pattern of negligence and forwarding the matter to \nDISCO for appropriate action. An administrative inquiry (ASC) was conducted by the \ncorporate employer after the discovery of the last incident in March 2007. At that time \nno punishment for the 2007 incident had been imposed. A report was issued on March \n28, 2007 (Exh. 31). It stated that Applicant \u201cwas involved in four minor security incidents \n(deviations), one infraction and one violation (involving compromise of classified \nmaterials) in the past 18 months.\u201d The recommendations of the ASC were based on the \none violation (communicating safe combination over phone), the infraction (alarm \nissue), and the most recent incident (disk marking) which it characterized as a \n\u201cdeviation\u201d. The deviations involving staff members were discounted as indicative of \nsecurity leadership weakness. \n \n            The inquiry concluded that Applicant was unable or unwilling to comply with \nsecurity rules and there was a clear pattern of negligence. The inquiry recommended a \nwritten warning, an adverse information report to DSS, and counseling of Applicant and \nhis manager on importance of compliance. In addition the report recommended that the \nmanager with access to the closed area should brief all employees on the importance of \nmarking all media. The report recommended no follow up activity or any changes in \npolicy or procedure. The report relied on the Progressive Discipline for Security \nIncidents guidelines (Exhs. 19 and 20).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n            One allegation, (SOR \u00b61 (h)), does not allege any specific conduct but recites \nthe facts alleged noting that two incidents by Applicant\u2019s staff were repeat offenses and \nfive of them involved classified computers. It recites the DSS conclusion that the facts \nindicate a pattern of \u201cnegligence and carelessness\u201d and that an Administrative Inquiry \n(ASC) was conducted and forwarded to DISCO. These facts are consistent with the \nrecord.  \n \n            Applicant had no security violations in his career before he was named ISSO. At \nthe time of the termination of his additional duty as ISSO, a new full time ISSO was \nnamed. After he was terminated as an ISSO in 2006, he had one security incident that \ninvolved him personally (SOR \u00b6 1 (i)) concerning unmarked media disks on March 19, \n2007. He has had no security incidents since the 2007 incident (Exhs. F and I).  \n \n            Three letters from Applicant\u2019s supervisors at three supervisory levels, and \nnumerous performance appraisals, evaluations, and awards were submitted in evidence \n(Exhs. A, B, and C). These letters describe him as scrupulous and conscientious about \nsecurity issues. They all recommended that he retain his security clearance. The \nevaluations describe Applicant as a dedicated, conscientious, and highly-valued \nemployee. He is described as hard working, ethical, honest, trustworthy, and reliable. \nApplicant is divorced and has three adult children (Tr. 21-24). \n \nPolicies \n \n            When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n            A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct   \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n            AG \u00b6 16 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying. The following is the only one that is potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n            Applicant\u2019s conduct was also alleged under Guideline K (Handling Protected \nInformation), as addressed below. That conduct constitutes credible adverse \ninformation in another adjudicative issue area that may not be sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It is also personal \nconduct that could create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n            AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) is sufficiently raised for consideration. Conditions that could mitigate \nPersonal Conduct security concerns are provided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n            The discussion under the guideline for Handling Protected Information is equally \nappropriate for this guideline. Additionally, Applicant has been open and honest about \nthe violations in his testimony and earlier statements. This has reduced any potential \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. The above mitigating conditions \nare applicable.  \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n            The same allegations alleged under Guideline E as security concerns were also \nalleged under Guideline K Handling Protected Information set out in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n            AG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of classified or other protected \ninformation to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to personal or \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nbusiness contacts, to the media, or to persons present at seminars, \nmeetings, or conferences; \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \u201cpalm\u201d \nor pocket device or other adjunct equipment; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and \n             \n(h) negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n            AG \u00b6 33 addresses \u201c[d]eliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and \nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information.\u201d Applicant\u2019s actions \nregarding the violations for which he was personally involved were not deliberate \nsecurity violations. Negligence is commonly defined as the failure to use reasonable \ncare under the circumstances. It is the doing of something which a reasonably prudent \nperson would not do, or the failure to do something which a reasonably prudent person \nwould do under like circumstances. The government characterized Applicant\u2019s actions \nas careless or negligent to which Applicant admitted. After considering all the evidence, \nI conclude that he was negligent in those three incidents. Applicant\u2019s actions were \nsufficient to raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(g) and (h) for consideration.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Handling Protected Information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities. \n \n            Applicant was chosen to be an ISSO in addition to his regular duties. He had \nnever held the duty before but he trained for it and attempted to insure through \naccelerated training that his staff was prepared. However, incidents occurred caused by \nothers for which he was held responsible and given punishment despite his best efforts \nto insure that they were not repeated. He has been appropriately disciplined for all of \nthe incidents including the ones actually committed by his staff without his knowledge, \ndirection, or permission.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n            Applicant no longer has the ISSO additional duties. He approaches the \ndischarge of his security responsibilities with a positive attitude and has had no further \ndifficulties since the disk marking incident. While he had three violations in which he \nwas personally involved as the administrative inquiry found, he was punished for all of \nthem. The first two resulted in warnings and he was suspended for five days without pay \nfor the third. However, the three incidents in which Applicant was personally involved \nwere quite different as to the type of security issues involved and the classification of \nthe three as an infraction, a violation, and a deviation. \n \n            The Progressive Discipline process applies increasing penalties as sequential \nviolations of a similar nature occur. Several of those for which his staff was involved \nwere similar in that they involved the use of classified equipment. The discipline did \nincrease for the last of the two trusted downloading staff incidents that occurred within a \nthree month period. The second one resulted in removal of ISSO responsibilities from \nApplicant. No further action was recommended by the ASC corporate inquiry.  \n \n            While the conclusion of the ASC is not binding on the government which \ncharacterized them at the hearing as only \u201copinions\u201d that neither bound the government, \nnor precluded further government action, the ASC makes rational and sensible findings \nin view of the circumstances of this case. I find that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n            Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n            (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n           Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Security violations are one of the \nstrongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified information, as \nthey raise very serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Once it is established that an applicant has committed a security violation, \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nhe or she has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he or she should be entrusted \nwith classified information. Because security violations strike at the very heart of the \nindustrial security program, an administrative judge must give any claims of reform and \nrehabilitation strict scrutiny.  \n \nIn many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having \nan indicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, \ndelinquent debts or drug use). No such indicator or any other indicator has occurred in \nthis case.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that supervisors can be held responsible for \nsecurity violations by members of their staff. The most recent decision so holding was \nISCR Case No. 06-21537 (App. Bd. February 2, 2008) where the Board reversed a \ndecision granting clearance to a supervisor who had a pattern of gross negligence, and \nhad failed to favorably respond to the security violations or to have a positive attitude \ntowards security duties. The facts of this case do not indicate that either failure is \napplicable to Applicant. \n \nSecurity violation cases reveal more than simply an indicator of risk but in ISCR \nCase No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006) cited by the government, the applicant was \nfound to have disregarded procedures and tried to conceal violations. No evidence of \nsuch conduct was established in this matter and, in fact, Applicant reported at least one \nincident when he was the only person to know of it, and he was punished with the staff \nviolator. He also directed another staff member not to do what he then proceeded to do \nthat resulted in a security incident. The frequency and duration of the security violations \nare also aggravating factors, but in ISCR Case no 97-0435 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998) the \ncase cited by the government for this issue, there was evidence of deliberate security \nviolations over a ten year period.  \n \nThe three incidents for which Applicant was personally involved were viewed by \nthe ASC as a single violation, a single infraction, and a single deviation. They were each \na different type of security violations committed over a period of 18 months with little, if \nany, consistent pattern as to the facts or even the gravity of the incidents.  \n \nApplicant is a dedicated, trustworthy employee who was in over his head as an \nISSO. His duties were more than he could effectively perform in addition to his basic \nrequired duties. He could not watch every action of his staff and others in the work \nenvironment.  Yet he was held responsible for them. He took steps to insure that \nadequate training was provided to insure that violations did not occur. He did as much \nas could be expected of him. There is no real potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of the same \nbehavior is very low. He has met his heavy burden.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct at the hearing and the quality of the answers to questions \nfrom both of the counsel and from me indicated complete honesty, and a willingness to \naccept responsibility for those actions for which he should have accepted responsibility. \nHe did not attempt to shift blame to others but realistically explained the difficulty of \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nattempting to insure full compliance by all members of the staff and others who had \naccess to the classified stations. The government conceded at the hearing that the case \nwas \u201csomewhat circumstantial\u201d (Tr. 159) and clearly it is. I am convinced that there are \nno lingering concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that justify \nremoval of his security clearance.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his handling \nprotected information and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n            Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n               \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n            \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.I:  For Applicant  \n \n             \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n        \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n            In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                                     _________________                       \nCharles D.

On April 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H, E,\nand J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on June 2, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nJune 26, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 9, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing on August 1, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 12, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and one other witness\ntestified on behalf of Applicant. He submitted Exhibits A through C, Which were\nreceived without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on August\n\n2\n11, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a., 1.b.,1.c., and 1.d., and  he\ndenied 2.a., 2.b.,  and 3.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nother witness, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is married, and he has two children. He received a\nBachelor of Science degree in 1997. \nApplicant works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists 4 allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under Adjudicative\nGuideline H. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were\nlisted in the SOR:\n1.a. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times three to six times\na year,  from approximately 1991 through at least December 2006.  \nApplicant testified that he actually last used marijuana on November 23, 2006.\nHe testified that he has matured and also because he is a father he does not think he\nshould use it in the future. \nHe testified credibly that he intends to never use marijuana again. He explained\nthat he has committed to his girlfriend that he will not use it again. He is planning a life\nwith his girlfriend, and he does not want drugs to play a part in that life. He also testified\nthat using Marijuana would hurt his career, about which he is now more serious. Finally,\nhe testified that even if he did not need a security clearance, he has made a decision\nthat he will not use marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \n1.b.  Applicant was arrested on or about June 19, 1994, and charged with\nPlanting and Cultivating Marijuana and or Hashish.  He was detained in jail for two days.\nHe testified that a friend gave him some marijuana plants and equipment, and Applicant\nset about to grow the marijuana plants. In the police report (Exhibit 5) Applicant told the\npolice that he planned to grow the marijuana to use himself, because he was spending\ntoo much money for the marijuana. Also in the police report it states that Applicant\u2019s girl\nfriend, whom Applicant testified is now his wife, stated that the marijuana found in their\n\n3\nbedroom, was for Applicant\u2019s personal use, \u201cbut occasionally he would sell it to friends.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant denied that he sold marijuana, he could give no reason for his\nformer girlfriend, and now wife, telling the police officers that he did sell marijuana at\ntimes. Finally Applicant did concede that  if the marijuana plants all grew, he considered\nselling the excess marijuana after he retained enough for his usage. \n1.c.  Applicant was arrested on or about September 26, 1998, as a result of a\nwarrant for his arrest from a 1992 Driving Under the Influence offense, during which he\nwas also charged with Possession of a Marijuana Cigarette. He was placed in a three\nmonth drug diversion program, at which time the drug related offense was removed\nfrom his record. Applicant testified that the warrant was also dismissed, because he had\npreviously fulfilled all of the requirements for the 1992 arrest.\n 1.d. Applicant continued to use marijuana through at least December 2006, even\nthough he was granted and possessed a security clearance from April 1998 to the\npresent. He testified that after he first completed a SCA, he was interviewed by a\nGovernment investigator, and at that time he wrote a signed, sworn statement in which\nhe promised that he would abstain from all drug usage in the future. Applicant conceded\nthat he did not keep that promise, nor could he give a reason for his failure to keep his\npromise. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n2.a. the conduct as set forth under paragraph 1., above. \n2.b. Applicant executed a SCA on November 29, 1997 (Exhibit 11).  Question\n#24 of the SCA asked since the age of 16 or in the previous seven years, whichever is\nshorter, had Applicant illegally used any controlled substance? Applicant answered\n\"Yes\" to this question, and replied that he had used marijuana on three occasions\nbetween August 1991 to June 1993. The Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s use of\nmarijuana was far more frequent and extensive than that listed by Applicant as\ndiscussed in subparagraph 1.a., above.  At the hearing Applicant conceded that he did\nnot include the full amount of his marijuana usage, because it could potentially hurt his\nchances of receiving a clearance. \n2.c.  During a June 18, 2007 interview with an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense, Applicant minimized his culpability in the 1994 drug cultivation\narrest, as discussed in 1.b., above. In the signed, sworn statement that he made as a\nresult of the interview (Exhibit 4), Applicant stated that a friend offered to help Applicant\nwith his rent if he let the friend use his garage to cultivate the marijuana. At the hearing\nApplicant conceded that this statement was not true.  Applicant also failed to identify to\nthe investigator that packets of marijuana were also found when the police searched\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s home. He did not give any reasonable explanation for his failure to give\ncomplete and truthful answers about this event to the investigator.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct. \n3.a. Applicant's conduct, reviewed above in Paragraph 2, subparagraphs b. and\nc., constitutes a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001,\nwhich is a felony.\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted performance evaluations from his employer from 2002\nthrough 2007 (Exhibit B). The ratings were quite positive with the overall rating of no\nless than \u201cMeets Requirements\u201d and as high as \u201cFar Exceeds Requirements.\u201d He also\nsubmitted some photographs of his family and some depicting him in his position as a\nchildren\u2019s soccer coach (Exhibit C), which he has done for five years.\nFinally, a witness, who is a manager of Applicant, and has known him for more\nthan ten years testified very positively on his behalf. However, when he was confronted\nwith the information that Applicant had been using marijuana while possessing a\nsecurity clearance and as recently as 2006, he indicated that he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d, and that\nApplicant \u201chas let a  lot (sic) of people down obviously.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use of\nmarijuana, and his many years of continued use after receiving a security clearance is\nof great concern, especially in light of his continued desire to have access to the\nnation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse\nclearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug\nabuse), (c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution), and (g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a\nsecurity clearance).\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s many years of use of an illegal substance, especially\nwhile holding a security clearance, and his lack of candor in the information about his\ndrug involvement that he furnished to the Government, I can not conclude at this time\nthat Applicant\u2019s conduct comes within any Mitigating Condition (MC). \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has failed to introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\n\n6\nexplanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against\nhim.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant received a\nsecurity clearance in April 1996,  and yet he continued to use marijuana through at least\nDecember 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s continued use of marijuana for many years, after being granted and\nmaintaining a security clearance, shows extremely poor judgement. \nAdditionally, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to the Government\nincomplete, untruthful answers regarding the extent of his drug involvement on a SCA\nthat he executed on November 29, 1997, and during an interview with a Government\ninvestigator on June 18, 2007.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that\nDC 16. (a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and\nfalsification of relevant facts from a personnel security questionnaire, which was used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility. DC (b) also applies since Applicant deliberately\nprovided false relevant information to the Government investigator. I can not find that\nany Mitigating Condition (MC) applies in this paragraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 2, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant\nengaged in criminal conduct, by his knowingly providing false and misleading\ninformation to the Government investigator and on a  security questionnaire, which is a\nfelony.\nDC 31. (a), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this\ncase. DC 31. (c), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, is also applicable to this case. There is no MC under\nCriminal Conduct. Paragraph 3, Guideline J is found against Applicant\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines H, E, and J in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s long history of using\nmarijuana, even while holding a security clearance, and his lack of honesty and candor\nwith the information he furnished to the Government, I find that the record evidence\nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability\nfor a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nDecember 22, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 19, 2006.  On July 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines E and K for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 15, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on July 18, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter, and I received the case\nassignment on September 17, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing that same day,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 25, 2008.  The Government\n\n2\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 and 2, which were received without objection.  Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit (AppX) A, without objection.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (TR) on October 6, 2008. The record closed the\ndate of the hearing, September 25, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraph 1.a, of the SOR, with explanation.  He denied the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c and 2.a of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nThe Applicant is a 51 year old engineer, who has worked in the defense industry\nfor 27 years, and has held a security clearance for \u201c25/26 years\u201d (TR at page 15 line 18\nto page 18 line 14).  During that time period, he has never had a security clearance\nviolation (Id).\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\n1.a.1.  Through the auspices of an internet service, which he joined in 2006, the\nApplicant corresponded, about once a week, with a Cambodian national (TR at page 19\nline 11 to page 23 line 23).  He also spoke to her on one occasion by telephone (Id).  In\n\u201cabout March of 2007,\u201d they terminated their communication (TR at page 19 line 11 to\npage 23 line 23).  When corresponding with this foreign national, he did not report this\nforeign contact to his Facility Security Officer (FSO), but the Government has failed to\nshow that Applicant has a responsibility to do so.  He did, however, report his\nassociation with this foreign national after the fact, as evidenced by a Foreign Relative\nor Associate Interview (AppX A at Encl V).\n1.a.2.  Through the auspices of the same internet service the Applicant\ncorresponded, about once a week, with a Philippine national (TR at page 23 line 24 to\npage 27 line 14).  He also spoke to her on the telephone (Id).  Again, in about March of\n2007, they terminated their communication (TR at page 23 line 24 to page 27 line 14).\nWhen corresponding with this foreign national, he did not report this foreign contact to\nhis Facility Security Officer (FSO), but the Government has failed to show that Applicant\nhas a responsibility to do so.  He did, however, report his association with this foreign\nnational after the fact, as evidenced by a Foreign Relative or Associate Interview (AppX\nA at Encl VI).\n1.a.3., 1.b. and 1.c.  Through the auspices of the internet service the Applicant\ncorresponded, \u201cat least once a week,\u201d with a Vietnamese national (TR at page 27 line\n15 to page 31 line 23).  About every other week, he also spoke to her on the telephone\n(Id).  In December of 2006, during a visit to Vietnam, the Applicant met this foreign\nnational (TR at page 35 line 5 to page 42 line 6).  The primary purpose of this trip was to\n\n3\nvisit Vietnam, and not to visit this foreign national (TR at page 48 line 16~20).  In about\nJuly of 2008, they terminated their relationship (TR at page 35 line 5 to page 42 line 6,\nand AppX A at Encl IV).  The Applicant did report his trip to Vietnam to his FSO (AppX A\nat Encl III).  He also reported his association with this foreign national after the fact, as\nevidenced by a Foreign Relative or Associate Interview (AppX A at Encl IV).\nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\n2.a.  The Applicant did comply with the National Industrial Security Program\nOperating Manual by reporting his December 2006 trip to Vietnam (TR at page 43 line\n15 to page 44 line 22, and AppX A at Encl III).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\n\n4\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nParagraph 15 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Personal Conduct: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out certain conditions that could raise security\nconcerns.  Subparagraph 16(c) arguably applies and provides that \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation\u201d may be disqualifying.  Here, the Applicant corresponded by e-mail with\nthree foreign nationals, spoke to them on the telephone, and visited one as part of his\ntrip to Vietnam.  This is clearly countered, however, by Subparagraph 17(e) as the\nApplicant \u201chas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d  Here, the Applicant has terminated whatever relationship he\nhad with the three foreign nationals.\nGuideline K - Handling Protected Information\nUnder Paragraph 33 the \u201c[d]eliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and\nregulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard\nsuch information . . . .\u201d  Here, I can find no Disqualifying Conditions applicable under the\nfacts of this case.  The Applicant complied with the requirements of the National\nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from his foreign contacts and alleged failure to safeguard protected information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On July 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F \nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 26, 2008, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received her response on September \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n29, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 5, 2008. On \nNovember 14, 2008, the case was assigned to another administrative judge, and on \nJanuary 15, 2009, the case was reassigned to me due to caseload considerations. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nJanuary 22, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government submitted a List of Government Exhibits, \nExhibit (Ex.) I. The Applicant offered a binder with three separate tabs collectively \nmarked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was received without objection, and \ntestified on her own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documents on her behalf. Applicant timely submitted a series of e-mails \ncollectively marked as AE B, which were received without objection.

Her admissions and \nexplanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old logistics analyst, who has worked for her defense \ncontractor employer since April 2008. GE 2, Tr. 19-20. She currently holds a top \nsecret clearance, discussed infra, and seeks to renew her clearance. To remain \neligible for employment, she must maintain a secret clearance. Tr. 20-21.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1989, and was awarded a \nbachelor of science degree majoring in information technology in October 2003. GE 2, \nTr. 21-23. She served in the U.S. Army from November 1991 to August 2000, and was \nhonorably discharged as a Sergeant (pay grade E-5). While in the Army, she \nsuccessfully held a top secret clearance, which was granted in December 1996. She \nmaintained that clearance with several employers post-Army until now. GE 2, Tr. 20-\n21, 28-29. \n \nApplicant was previously married from December 1990 to February 1993. That \nmarriage ended by divorce. Applicant remarried in December 1998, and that marriage \nended by divorce in January 2002. She has a nine-year-old son from her second \nmarriage. Applicant lives and works in a very remote U.S. location in military housing \nwith her 61-year-old mother, and nine-year-old son. Her mother suffers from the \neffects of a 2003 heart attack and receives social security disability payments. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is unable to care for herself both financially and physically. \nApplicant provides her mother financial support sufficient to claim her as a tax \nexemption. GE 2, Tr. 23-28. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her signed sworn October 2002 statement, her September 2004 \nSF-86, her December 2004, May 2006, December 2007, June 2008, November 2008 \ncredit reports, and April 2008 DOHA Interrogatories. GE 1 \u2013 8.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 11 separate line items, which included three charged \noff accounts, and eight collection accounts approximating $36,900.  \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to unemployment following her \ndischarge from the Army, a series of low paying jobs, a former husband who incurred \ndebt and did not contribute to the family income, and a separation followed by divorce. \nIt was not until she secured her present job that she was able to earn sufficient income \nto support herself and her family. Tr. 35-56. \n \nSince her SOR was issued, Applicant has paid off one charged off account in \nthe amount of $683.00 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). In September 2008, she entered into an \nagreement with a credit management company to consolidate her debts. Since \nOctober 2008, she has been paying this company a monthly fee by direct debit that is \napplied to the company\u2019s fee or debt principle. AE A. Additionally, post-hearing she \nprovided evidence of having sought financial counseling and provided updates of her \nprogress in attaining financial stability. AE B. \n \nApplicant provided five favorable reference letters from individuals who have \nknown her in a professional and personal capacity. All references support the notion \nthat Applicant is trustworthy and honorable. AE A. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant owed substantial debt as reflected \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.k. through her admissions and evidence presented. At the time the \nSOR was issued in July 2008, Applicant owed 11 debts approximating $36,900. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness stems from a lengthy period of underemployment and \nunemployment. Additionally, her former husband incurred debt during Applicant\u2019s \nsecond marriage which she is responsible for. All of this contributed to Applicant being \nplaced in a financial tailspin.  \n \nHer financial situation has substantially improved as a result of finding a job \nwhich provides her with enough income to support her family and meet her financial \nobligations. She entered into an agreement with a credit management company to \nwhom she pays a monthly fee by direct debit, and has sought financial counseling. \nShe has submitted post-hearing updates on her financial progress. She has \nestablished a credible budget. All indicators point to an individual who has taken this \nprocess quite seriously and taken what appears to be all reasonable steps to correct \nher financial situation. What is different now as opposed to before is she has the \nmeans, tools and resolve to achieve financial stability. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are three potentially mitigating conditions: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because at the time Applicant incurred the debts, she was \neither underemployed or unemployed, and married to a spouse whose spending \nexceeded his contributions. Her financial situation continued to deteriorate during her \nseparation and divorce. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant sought financial \ncounseling. While paying down her debts, she continues to explore strategies to \nimprove her financial situation. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies because Applicant initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. In short, Applicant \nhas made substantial progress in turning her financial situation around. She has \nestablished a viable budget, which shows a net remainder after her monthly bills are \npaid. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I also gave \nconsiderable weight to her years of honorable service in the Army, her years of \nsuccessfully holding a top secret clearance, her service as a defense contractor \nserving in a very remote U.S. location, and her being the sole support for her nine-\nyear-old son and to a lesser extent her 61-year-old mother. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.k.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born and raised in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1989 at the age of 16 to pursue his education (see ex. 4). At the time of his emigration, he and his family members were citizens of the British Colony of Hong Kong, before it reverted to the PRC. British culture and capitalism were major influences on Applicant in his formative years. Mainland China and the Communist Party played no part in his family upbringing. After completing his high school education in the U.S., Applicant enrolled in a local university. Applicant obtained B.S. degrees in mechanical engineering and mathematics in 1995 and 1996, respectively, an M.S. degree in engineering in 1998, and an M.B.A. in 2003, all from the same local university (see exs. 1 and 4)). Since 1998, Applicant has worked as a lecturer and net manager for the university where he earned his degrees (ex. 1). He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in April 2006 and received his U.S. passport in May 2006 (see exs. 1 and 3). Applicant is unmarried and has no children. For the first 10 years of his residency in the U.S., he lived alone. His mother joined him in 1999 and currently resides with him as a permanent resident (see ex. ",

Green, Esquire       \n \n \n______________ \n \n Decision \n______________ \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge: \n \nHISTORY OF CASE \n \n \nOn May 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 6, 2008, and requested a hearing.  The \ncase was assigned to me on July 10, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on \nSeptember 17, 2008.  A hearing was held on September 17, 2008, for the purpose of \nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, \ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's \ncase consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on five witnesses (including himself) and \neight exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on September 25, 2008.  Based upon \na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified \ninformation is denied. \nNovember 5, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nBesides its five exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of six \ndocuments:  Background Note: China, U.S. Department of State (January 2007); \nCountry Specific Information: China, U.S. Department of State (December 2007); \nIntelligence Threat Handbook [Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency OPSEC \nSupport Staff (IOSS) (June 2004); 2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and \nSecurity Review Commission (November 2007); Annual Report to Congress from the \nNational Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006 (August \n2006); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, China, U.S. Department of \nState  (March 2008); Background Note: Hong Kong, U.S. Department of State (February \n2008); Country Specific Information: Hong Kong SAR, U.S. Department of State \n(December 2007) \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR \nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for \nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative Law, \nSec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was \ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical \nsituation in Hong Kong. Administrative notice was extended to the documents \nthemselves, consistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  This notice did  \nnot foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information \ncontained in the reports addressing Hong Kong\u2019s current state.   \n \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues \n \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to consider retention of \nhis British identity card and passport and document their surrender should he make the \ndecision to do so.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days, to October 1, \n2008 to supplement the record. The Government was afforded seven days to respond.  \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with faxed and posted \ncover letters to the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. relinquishing his permanent \nidentity card and requesting renunciation of his British citizenship and relinquishing his \nBritish passport. Department counsel did not object to these post-hearing submissions.  \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered as exhibits M and N.   \n \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS \n \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have a father who is a citizen of the \nUnited Kingdom who resides in Hong Kong.   \n \nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to have (a) exercised dual citizenship with \nthe U.S. and Hong Kong, (b) maintained a valid British (.U.K.)  passport (expiration date \nin September 2013), (c) maintained a valid Hong Kong personal identity card, allowing \n\n \n3\nhim the right of abode in Hong Kong, and (d) declined to have relinquished his U.K. \npassport due to increased travel flexibility when traveling in Hong Kong. \n \nFor his answer, Applicant denied each of the allegations in the SOR without \nexplanations.  \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as \nrelevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent. He \nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1989 at the age of 16 to pursue his education (see ex. 4). At the \ntime of his emigration, he and his family members were citizens of the British Colony of \nHong Kong, before it reverted to the PRC.  British culture and capitalism were major \ninfluences on Applicant in his formative years.  Mainland China and the Communist Party \nplayed no part in his family upbringing.  \n \nAfter completing his high school education in the U.S., Applicant enrolled in a local \nuniversity.  Applicant obtained B.S. degrees in mechanical engineering and mathematics \nin 1995 and 1996, respectively, an M.S. degree in engineering in 1998, and an M.B.A. in \n2003, all from the same local university (see exs. 1 and 4)).  Since 1998, Applicant has \nworked as a lecturer and net manager for the university where he earned his degrees (ex. \n1).  He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in April 2006 and received his U.S. passport in \nMay 2006 (see exs. 1 and 3). \n \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children.  For the first 10 years of his residency \nin the U.S., he lived alone.  His mother joined him in 1999 and currently resides with him \nas a permanent resident (see ex. 4), and has lived with him ever since.  He has been self-\nsufficient since 2000 (ex. 4). \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members include his mother who became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in August 2002, and has resided with Applicant since 1999 (see \nex. 1; R.T., at 25).  His father is a dual citizen of Great Britain and the PRC by virtue of his \nbirth in Hong Kong and unilateral declaration by the PRC that persons who are of \nChinese descent and who were born in the mainland China or Hong Kong are PRC \ncitizens (see Country Specific Information: Hong Kong SAR, U.S. Department of State \n(December 2007).  His father owns and operates a herbal business in Hong Kong and \nhas no known ties to the PRC government (see ex. 4).  \n \nApplicant maintains weekly telephone contact with his father.  He visited him in \nHong Kong in August 2003, and saw him again in July 2004, when he and his father \n\n \n4\nunited with his sister in Great Britain for his sister\u2019s college graduation (see ex. R.T., at \n107-08).  Applicant\u2019s father visited him on three or four occasions before 2000.  \n \n Applicant has one sister who resides in Britain (R.T., at 110-11).  She has British \ncitizenship by birth and now PRC citizenship by virtue of the PRC\u2019s unilateral declaration \n(R.T., at 111-12).  She earned a doctorate degree in international relations and resides in \nBritain.  She holds an academic position in economics at a British university (ex. 4; R.T., \nat 25).  Applicant  keeps regular telephone contact with her, once or twice a week (see \nex. 4).  She comes to visit Applicant, her mother, and other family members every year \n(R.T., at 112-13)   \n \nApplicant has not been involved in any embarrassing or compromising incidents \noverseas, and has not engaged in any illegal activities (ex. 4).  He provides no financial  \nassistance to any of his family members (who are self-sufficient), or to anyone or any \nentity outside the U.S.  He has never served in a foreign military; nor he is willing to do so \n(ex. 4). He has had no contact with any foreign government representatives or \norganizations since residing in the U.S.  He has no financial interests or obligations in \nHong Kong.  He has no property ownership, no foreign bank accounts, no retirement, \nmedical, or education benefits in Hong Kong, and no social security or any other received \ngovernment benefit from Hong Kong or any other foreign country (see ex. 4).  He has \nnever had any foreign property confiscated, and he has never sponsored any foreign \nnationals to the U.S. (see ex. 4). Nor has he ever voted or sought political office in Hong \nKong or any foreign country, and has not performed or attempted to perform duties that \ncould serve the interests of Hong Kong or any foreign government.  \n \nBy contrast, Applicant has held jobs in the U.S. and maintains brokerage accounts \nwith U.S. banks.  He owns the home he resides in. He considers himself a fully \nassimilated U.S. citizen (see ex. 4; R.T., at 26), and professes no allegiance, preference, \nsympathies or alliances with any person or entity or government in the PRC, or anywhere \nelse (see ex. 4).  He fully understands the importance of reporting any all foreign travel to \nhis employer\u2019s security officials. \n \n \nApplicant retained his valid British permanent identity card and passport after \nbecoming a naturalized U.S. citizen and receiving his U.S. passport.  His passport carried \na September 8, 2013 expiration date (see exs. 3).  He also retained a Hong Kong \npermanent identity card that entitled him to claim Hong Kong as his permanent abode \n(see ex. 3).  Prior to the hearing, Applicant had declined to relinquish either his British \npassport or his permanent identity card, citing the flexibility it affords him and the lack of \nany furnished reason why he should relinquish it (R.T., at 104-05).  Informed of the nature \nof the Government\u2019s concerns over dual citizens holding foreign passports and using \nthem to travel abroad, Applicant acknowledged his understanding of the reasons and \nexpressed a desire to reconsider his retention of his British passport (R.T., at 113-16). \n \nIn his post-hearing submissions, Applicant documented relinquishing his Hong \nKong permanent identity card (see ex. M), and renouncing his British citizenship and \n\n \n5\nrelinquishing his British passport (see ex. N).  In the package materials he mailed to the \nBritish Embassy in the U.S., he enclosed his original British passport and identity card \nand asked for certified statements of receipt of his identity card and passport and a \ncertificate of citizenship renunciation (see exs. M and N).  Although the PRC\u2019s nationality \nlaw imposed unilateral Chinese citizenship on Hong Kong citizens before the 1997 \nreversion, this provision of the law would not appear to apply to Applicant who had \nbecome a permanent resident of the U.S. before 1997 and a U.S. citizen in 2006.  Neither \nthe SOR nor the Government\u2019s proofs claim Applicant exercised any dual citizenship with \nthe PRC and the U.S. following the reversion.  Because Applicant\u2019s British passport and \nidentity card entitled him to entry/exit and abode privileges, though, they create some \ncross links with the PRC that carried over even after the reversion. \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by close friends, family members, college professors,  \nand colleagues. A close friend from college who has kept in touch and is familiar with \nApplicant\u2019s background describes him as honest, selfless, and ever-generous, and one \nwho was instrumental in their joint start-up of a non-profit end-to-end encrypted email \nproduct (see ex. G; R.T., at 26-28). A cousin whose family sheltered Applicant after he \narrived from Hong Kong described him as very trustworthy (ex. I). And a former college \nprofessor described Applicant as a serious, hard-working, and reliable student (see ex. \nF). \n \nApplicant\u2019s professional associates characterize his work as excellent in quality \nand credit his honesty and cite his important contributions to his team\u2019s soft-ware projects \n(see ex. D; R.T., at 34 ).  His direct supervisor and senior engineer of his project team \ndescribe Applicant as an excellent performer who possesses sound judgment and is \nhonest and trustworthy in all of his work relationships (see ex. C; R.T., at 43-47).  \nApplicant\u2019s group leader who hired him in 2006 describes him as an excellent performer \nwho he considers to be honest and trustworthy.  He credits Applicant with developing all \nof his project\u2019s computer models and software design, and supporting other project \noperations in important troubleshooter roles (see ex. B; R.T., at 53-55).   \n \nApplicant documents excellent performance reviews for his past two years of \nservice to his employer (see exs. K and L).  He was credited by his supervisor with \nconsistently high ratings in all of the pertinent assessment criteria. \n \nHong Kong\u2019s historical background \n \nHong Kong\u2019s history dates back over five millennia.  It developed strong trading \nrelationships with Britain in 1842 (following the First Opium War) under the Treaty of \nNanking (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 2).  Britain was granted a perpetual \nlease on the Kowloon Peninsula under the 1860 Convention of Beijing, and expanded its \ncontrol over the surrounding area under a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898 \n(id.). \n \n\n \n6\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hong Kong developed as a warehousing \nand distribution center for British trade with southern China (see Background Note: Hong \nKong, supra).  Heavy migration to Hong Kong occurred after the Communist takeover of \nmainland China in 1949.  Hong Kong achieved considerable economic success as a \nBritish colony in the post-1949 period as a manufacturing, commercial, finance, and \ntourism center.  High life expectancies, literacy, per capita income, and a confluence of \nother \nsocioeconomic \nindicators \nserve \nto \nillustrate \nHong \nKong\u2019s \nmeasurable \nsocioeconomic achievements. \n \nHong Kong\u2019s reversion \n \nSince July 1, 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of \nthe PRC.  This is important to note because of the generally recognized heightened risks \nthat are associated with the PRC, and the unilaterally imposed citizenship and residency \nstatus on Applicant and his father as birth residents and citizens of Hong Kong before the \nreversion (see Country Specific Information: Hong Kong SAR, supra, at 2).  Dual national \nAmericans like Applicant and his mother (who became naturalized U.S. citizens after the \nreversion) who use their non-U.S. passports are at risk to denials of U.S. consular \nprotections by the PRC government (id.)  This does not mean that the U.S. Government \nwill not offer consular services to dual nationals who use their non-U.S. passports in Hong \nKong and other sectors of the PRC.   But because the PRC does not recognize dual \ncitizenship under its nationality law, use of other than a U.S. passport to enter China can \nsimply increase the difficulties of consular assistance for any dual national who is arrested \nunder such circumstances (id.). \n \nHong Kong today has a population of 6.92 million (95 per cent of which are \nChinese), and is one of the most densely populated regions of the world.  China has \ngiven Hong Kong considerable autonomy over its domestic affairs. The PRC has retained \nresponsibility and control over foreign and defense affairs.  State Department records \nconfirm that the PRC has taken an increasingly active oversight role over Hong Kong\u2019s \npolitical developments. \n \nStill, both the Sino-British joint declaration (1984) and the basic Law provide \npolitical safeguards to ensure that Hong Kong retains its own political, economic, and \njudicial systems and unique status for at least 50 years after reversion and continue to \nparticipate in international conventions and organizations under the name of \u201cHong Kong, \nChina (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 2). Hong Kong, with its quasi \nautonomy, remains a free and open society where human rights are respected, courts are \nindependent, and there are established traditions of respect for the rule of law (see id., at \n3).   \n \nCitizens of Hong Kong are limited, however, in their ability to change their \ngovernment, and the legislature is limited in its power to change government policies (id.). \nAnd the PRC still retains oversight and ultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s \neconomic and political decision making.  Any changes in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (such \n\n \n7\nas to achieve full universal suffrage) will require approval by Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive \n(currently Donald Tsang), at least a two thirds approval by the Legislative Counsel \n(Legco), and then the PRC\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress Standing Committee (NPSCS), \nwhich is by no means assured (see id, at 3). \n \nBecause Applicant\u2019s father is still a citizen and resident of Hong Kong with \nunilaterally imposed Chinese citizenship by the PRC\u2019s immigration law, the PRC\u2019s \nsystem, its respect for human rights and the rule of law, and its collection activities that \nextend throughout its maintained intelligence operations in Hong Kong and Macau, \nbecome quite relevant to evaluating any potential security risks associated with Applicant \nand his father. \n \nThe PRC\u2019s country status \n \nEstablished in 1949, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) with over 1.3 billion \npeople is the world\u2019s most populous country.  Today it continues to undergo rapid \neconomic and social change.  Political power, however,  remains centralized in the \nChinese Communist Party (CCP) with little indication of any change in the foreseeable \nfuture.  China\u2019s 70.8 million country is authoritarian in structure and ideology and \npossesses increasingly sophisticated military forces which continues to transform itself \nfrom a land-based military power to a smaller, more mobile, high tech military that \neventually will be capable of mounting limited operations beyond its coastal waters (see \nBackground Note: China, supra, at 14-16).  \n \nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and interests, the PRC \nmaintains a relationship that is more competitive than cooperative.  The PRC operates a \nlarge and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the Ministry of State Security (MSS) \n(see Intelligence Threat Handbook, supra, at 17 (June 2004)).  These operations use \nclandestine agents to collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC who \nare suspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other pro-\ndemocracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities  (see Intelligence \nThreat Handbook, supra, at 72). \n \nBased on past reports to Congress, the PRC is considered one of the most active \ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information (see Annual Report to Congress \nfrom the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006, \nsupra).  The PRC is known especially to use its intelligence services to gather information \nabout the US and to obtain advanced technologies (see Intelligence Threat Handbook, \nsupra, at 17).  The PRC actively monitors international communications satellites from \nmaintained intercept facilities, in addition to collecting information on US military \noperations and exercises.  Examples of PRC economic espionage are cited in the Annual \nReport to Congress from the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic \nCollection, 2005-2006, supra, at 10-12.  Most of the examples of illegally exported \ntechnology to the PRC involved high tech equipment and devices used in missile and \n\n \n8\naircraft guidance systems, highly sensitive weapons parts, infrared cameras and missile \nmicrochips.  \n \n As a corollary of its authoritarian roots, the PRC has never been known for a \npositive human rights record among Western nations and international human rights \ngroups.  Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC\u2019s lack of any cognizable \ntradition for respect for developing democracies and the rule of law. State Department \ncountry reports on the PRC cite the country\u2019s poor human rights record.  Its noted \nhistorical abuses include the suppression of political dissent, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners (see Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, China, supra, at 2-9). \n \nOf growing concern to U.S. security interests are State Department\u2019s latest  reports \nof increased high profile cases in the PRC involving the monitoring, harassment, \ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers \nseeking to exercise their law-protected rights (see  Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices - 2007, supra). The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible \naccounting of all those killed, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in custody, \ndisappearance, torture, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment \n(see id., at 2-3). While the PRC officially denies holding any political prisoners, Western \nnon-government organizations estimate that approximately 500 persons remained in \nprison in 2006 for the repealed crime of counterrevolution, and thousands of others were \neither serving sentences or were being detained for counter-revolutionary offenses (id., at \n8).  \n \nIn its November 2007 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission \ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge \ndeveloped by multiples of collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by \nespionage (see  2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission, supra, at 104-06).  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to acquire sensitive \ntechnology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence measures.  Recent \nindictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight the PRC\u2019s spying \nactivities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating its own 2004 U.S.-China agreement, the PRC oft-\nfails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use items licensed for export to \nthe PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they are multilateral in scope (see \nid.).  Without effective dual use export controls in place, the PRC can be expected to \nacquire dual use technologies with military potential through the U.S. and other source \ncountries.  \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by \nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These \nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could \n\n \n9\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and \nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the \nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In \naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into \naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to \nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy \nfactors are pertinent herein: \n \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security \nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial \ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. \ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign \ninterest.  Adjudication under the this Guideline can and should \nconsidered the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism   See revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG), \u00b6 6. \n \nForeign Preference \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate   \npreference    for a foreign country over the United States, then he or \nshe may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are \nharmful to the interests of the United States.  See AG, \u00b6 9. \n \n \n \n \n \n      Burden of Proof \n \nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continued   \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n10\n \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted fact[s] \nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven \nhave a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security \nclearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately \nor inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or \nmitigation of the Government's case. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was born in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent and traces his \nBritish heritage through Hong Kong\u2019s historical colonial links with Britain. He immigrated \nto the U.S. in 1989 for educational reasons.  He completed his high school and college \ncurricula in the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen in 2006.  Applicant is a highly regarded \nengineer for a U.S. defense contractor.  Security issues of concern to the Government \nfocus on his past exercise of dual citizenship with Hong Kong and the U.S. through his \npost-naturalization possession of his British identity card and passport and the \ncitizenship and residence of an immediate family member (his father) in Hong Kong \nfollowing its reversion to the PRC in 1997, a country known for its poor human rights \nrecord and its engagement in economic data collection in Hong Kong and the U.S. \n \nForeign influence concerns \n \nGovernment urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmember (his father) that resides in Hong Kong (which has since reverted to the PRC) \nmight be subject to undue foreign influence by PRC authorities to access classified \ninformation in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  Because Applicant and his father who \nhave PRC citizenship by virtue of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC in 1997, they \npresent potential heightened security risks covered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 \n7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates \na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.  \n \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s father in what is now the PRC \nposes some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign \ninfluence that could compromise classified information under Applicant's possession \nand/or control.  DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \n\n \n11\ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d has possible application due to \nthe  presence of Applicant\u2019s father in the PRC. Although, Applicant has not seen his \nfather since his last visit to Hong Kong in 2003, and has no financial interests in China \nthat could create potential conflicts of interest. \n \nBorn and raised in Hong Kong, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1989 and \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006.  Likewise, his mother immigrated to the U.S. \nand became a naturalized U.S. citizen (in 2002).  His only sister has retained her British \npassport (albeit now a citizen of the PRC by virtue of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion) and \nresides in Britain.  All of Applicant\u2019s assets and financial interests are situate in the U.S. \n \nApplicant and his family have deep roots in Hong Kong (for years a British \ncolony) and are steeped in British culture, free markets, democratic government, human \nrights protections, and respect for the rule of law.  Applicant has no contacts with or \ninterests in the PRC. \n \nFrom what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily residing in Hong Kong (with only his father identified as such an immediate family \nmember residing in the country) have any political affiliations with the Hong Kong or \nPRC governing bodies.  Nor does his father have any history to date of being subjected \nto any coercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same.  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe citizenship status and presence in Hong Kong of Applicant\u2019s father poses \nsome risk because of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC\u2019 and the latter\u2019s sovereign \noversight powers over all of Hong Kong\u2019s domestic affairs, and plenary responsibility \nover its external affairs.  The risks are manageable, though, and reconcilable with U.S. \nsecurity interests. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his father (while regular) are more than \nneutralized by the former\u2019s had demonstrated strong loyalties to the U.S. and manifest \ncommitments to protect this country\u2019s security interests and resist any family pressures \nthat could weaken his fiducial duties to protecting classified information. \n \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se \nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are \ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an \nacceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence \ncases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are \navailable for referencing in the supplied materials and country information about Hong \nKong.  \n \nThe new AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the \nU.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with \ncitizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical \naims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter.  \n\n \n12\n \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's father in \nHong Kong (a Chinese sector that continues in a semi-autonomous way despite its \nreversion to the PRC), any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue \nforeign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or \neconomic or proprietary data out of Applicant through his family members residing in \nHong Kong is a manageable one. \n \n Applicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating \ncondition: MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  \n \nFor Hong Kong, with its quasi autonomy, remains a free and open society where \nhuman rights are respected, courts are independent, and there are established \ntraditions of respect for the rule of law (see id., at 3).  True, citizens of Hong Kong are \nlimited in their ability to change their government, and the legislature is limited in its \npower to change government policies (id.).  Further, the PRC still retains oversight and \nultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision making. \nSince reversion, though, the PRC has essentially left Hong Kong to manage its own \ninternal affairs without any interference from PRC authorities.  This deference is not \nexpected to change in the foreseeable future.  \n \nApplicant, accordingly, may take partial advantage of mitigating condition: MC \u00b6 \n8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Further, in the hypothetical situation where \nApplicant\u2019s father or any of his family members residing in Hong Kong, Britain, or the \nU.S. were to be pressured, Applicant\u2019s strong loyalties and security commitments to the \nU.S. make it very unlikely that he would permit himself to be pressured into \ncompromising classified information.  \n \nOf full benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, \npatriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S., are well demonstrated and \nenough under these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in \nhis relationships with his immediate family members and college.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to \nconflict of interests with his father in Hong Kong.  Not only has Applicant become a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen and received his advanced degrees in the U.S., but he has \nmade every effort to work, save, and pursue his financial interests exclusively in the \nU.S.  Applicant is highly regarded and trusted by his friends, former university \nprofessors, co-workers and supervisors who regularly interface with him.  None of these \ncharacter references is aware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of \nhis family members might be exposed to.   \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being \nbrought to bear on his father or any of his immediate family members would appear to \nbe minimal.  By all reasonable accounts of the presented record, Applicant has no \nvisible conflicts of interest with Hong Kong and the PRC or property interests in China \nthat could be at risk to exploitation or compromise by Hong Kong government \nauthorities or PRC military or intelligence officials.   \n \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's father residing \nin Hong Kong are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about \nApplicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial \nrelationships in Hong Kong (now part of the PRC).  His demonstrated loyalties and \ncommitments to protecting U.S. security interests, make it highly unlikely he would \nsuccumb to any foreign influence brought to bear on himself or his father by PRC \ngovernment or military officials.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the \nallegations covered by Guideline B. \n \nForeign preference concerns \n \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite \ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the \nforeign country over the interests of the U.S.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over \nApplicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the U.S. \n \nBy virtue of his birth in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese ancestry, Applicant \nbecame entitled to a British identity card and passport which he continued to hold even \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen.  He was free to relinquish these documents at any time of \nhis choosing.   Until this hearing, he consistently declined to relinquish his British \nidentity card and passport out of respect for his parents and his desire for flexibility.  \nSince becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken no actions and \nexercised no British or PRC privileges that can be fairly characterized as active indicia \nof dual citizenship, save for his retention of his British identity card and passport  He \nholds no assets in Hong Kong, retains no Hong Kong privileges, and has never \nperformed or attempted to perform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the \ninterests of Hong Kong or the PRC in preference to the interests of the U.S. since \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. \n \n\n \n14\nBecause Applicant continued to possess his British passport after becoming a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, the Government may apply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a) \nof AG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This \nincludes but is not limited to: \n \n (1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;  \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other \nsuch benefits from a foreign country;  \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;  \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in             \nanother country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election.   \n \n However, Applicant claims no intention to return to Hong Kong to live, has no \nfinancial interests in Hong Kong, and has never used his British/PRC citizenship to \nprotect his financial or business interests.  By relinquishing his British identity card and \npassport, Applicant has complied with the mitigation requirements of MC \u00b6 11 (e), \u201cthe \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated,\u201d of AG \u00b6 918. He satisfies the mitigation requirements of MC \u00b6 11 \n(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  \nAccordingly, each of these mitigating conditions has application to Applicant\u2019s situation. \n \nFailure to satisfy a mitigating condition may be taken into account when \nassessing an applicant\u2019s overall claim of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances, but may not be turned into a disqualifying condition.  See ISCR Case \nNo. 01-02270 (Appeal Bd. Aug. 29, 2003).  That Applicant herein may have initially \nwished to keep his dual British citizenship and retain his British identity card and \npassport out of respect for his parents and his desired flexibility is not sufficient reason \nto preclude him from mitigating security concerns over his holding dual citizenship and \nretaining his British identity card and passport, if those rights did not entail his exacting \npreferential retirement privileges from Hong Kong or the PRC.   \n \nWhole person precepts favor Applicant\u2019s preference for the U.S. over Britain and \nindirectly th PRC by virtue of the reversion.  He is a U.S. citizen by naturalization and \nhas consistently demonstrated his loyalty for the U.S.  All of his financial interests are \nsituated in the U.S.  He is highly regarded by his friends and university professors that \n\nhe has impressed with his academic achievements and trusted personal relationships, \nand with his coworkers and supervisors who credit him with sound judgment, reliability \nand trustworthiness in executing his team project responsibilities. Renouncing his British \ncitizenship and relinquishing his British identity card and passport document his \nundivided loyalty and preference for U.S. institutions and its way of life over those of his \nbirth country (Hong Kong/Britain), and indirectly the PRC. \n \nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the U.S.  He satisfies his \nproof burden in several ways: demonstrated lack of any exercise of any privileges \nassociated with his British citizenship, save for his possession of his British identity card \nand passport after his naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 2006. Applicant absolves \nhimself of foreign preference concerns and carries his evidentiary burden on the \npresented issue of whether his preference lies with his adopted country (U.S.) or the \ncountry (Hong Kong/Britain) where he was born and raised as a minor through his \nparents\u2019 British citizenship. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the \nallegations covered by subparagraphs 2.a through 2.d of Guideline C. \n \nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a \nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the \nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, \nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate \nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSub-para 1.a: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nGUIDELINE C: (FOREIGN PREFERENCE): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSub-para. 2.a : \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSub-para. 2.b : \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSub-para. 2.c : \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSub-para. 2.d : \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n15\n\n \n16\nConclusions \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.   \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n                                   \n    \nRoger C.

On May 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 6, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 23, 2008. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. On July 31, 2008, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for August 21, 2008. The case was heard on that \ndate. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. Applicant testified. She offered ten exhibits which were admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1-10. The transcript was received on September 2, 2008.  \nSeptember 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old truck driver whose company subcontracts with a \nDepartment of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance.

She worked there for 30 years. She received $42,000 when the \nbusiness closed. She used the money to attend truck driving school and started a truck \ndriving business. She had good credit at the time. She was able to purchase four trucks \nfor her business from 1998 through 2001. (Tr at 24, 45-46; AE C.) \n \nIn 2001, Applicant began to have serious health problems. She had severe nerve \ndamage in both arms. A doctor advised her that she may need to have both arms \namputated. Applicant worried about who would take care of her. Her brother had \ncerebral palsy and lived in a home most of his life and did not receive excellent care. \nConcerned the same thing would happen to her, she became depressed and did not \nwork for 14 months starting in approximately September 2001. She never sought \ntreatment for depression. (Tr at 16, 33, 69-72; Gov 2 at 4-7.)  \n \nAround 2002, a friend told Applicant to get a second opinion and referred her to a \ndoctor.  Based on the doctor\u2019s opinion, Applicant had surgery on her left arm to relieve \nthe nerve damage. She had health insurance at the time. After the surgery, she \ndiscovered that her health insurance company went out of business and she was left \nwith a $30,000 surgery bill in addition to her other debts. (Tr at 15, 42-43; Gov 2 at 4; \nAE A; AE B.) Applicant still needs surgery on her right arm as well as cataract surgery. \nThe surgery for her right arm will cost approximately $30,000. She is unable to get \nhealth insurance based on her pre-existing condition. (Tr at 25, 63, 68; Gov 2 at Gov 2 \nat 4-6.) \n   \nApplicant admits that she owes a lot of bills. She disputes the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.h. 1.m, 1.o, 1.q, 1.u, and 1.x because she does not recognize the \ncreditor. She disputes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.w because the credit cards \nwere reported as stolen. She did not formally dispute any of the accounts with the credit \nreporting agencies. (Tr at 47-60.) She claims the following debts are duplicates: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.j, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.v. Upon review of the credit reports (Gov 3, Gov 4, \nGov 5), it appears the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j, and the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.l \nare duplicates. Essentially, the debts were sold to a collection agency. For this reason, I \nfind for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.l.   \n \nApplicant is unable to pay any of her debts. She is focusing on saving money for \nher surgery. She sought the advice of a credit counselor who advised her to file for \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbankruptcy. She claims she does not have enough money to hire a bankruptcy attorney. \n(Tr at 45, 48-49, 63-64.)  \n \nApplicant describes her current financial situation as tough. She begged her \ndoctor to allow her to go back to work because she needed the money. She often \nborrows money from her boyfriend, who is also her truck driving partner, to pay for her \nmedications. She currently earns approximately $800 to $1,000 per month. She lives \nwith her boyfriend. She does not pay rent but shares in buying groceries. She also pays \nher medical and phone bill. Her medicine costs around $300 a month. She would love to \npay her debts but her focus is on her health issues. Her medical expenses in 2007 \ntotaled $5,379. Her total income was approximately $14,283. (Tr at 22; 61-63, 69; AE \nF.) She is current on her federal and state taxes. (Tr at 73; AE H; AE I; AE J.) \n \nThe general manager of the company who loaned Applicant money to purchase \nfour trucks wrote a letter on her behalf.  Prior to approving the loans, Applicant\u2019s \ncredentials and credit were investigated. It was discovered that she had an excellent \ncredit rating. He has firsthand knowledge of her health problems, having acted as a \nrecovery agent for the lenders. He notes she was unable to find a suitable manager for \nher business. She voluntarily surrendered the trucks. He states Applicant is \u201can honest, \nhonorable and caring person that unfortunately had an overwhelming business problem, \nwhich marred her otherwise excellent credit and personal ratings.\u201d (AE C.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s boyfriend and truck driving partner wrote a letter on her behalf. He \nwas also present at the hearing to provide emotional support to Applicant. He has \nknown Applicant for about five years.  He finds her to be \u201can honest, loyal and dedicated \nworker and partner in life.\u201d  He states that in an attempt to increase her income she put \na team of drivers in her truck and went to work on his truck as a co-driver. The drivers \nwrecked the truck.  He states that they have carried numerous sensitive loads for \nvarious companies and government agencies, including DOD. (AE D.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \n\n \n6 \n \n \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. From 2001 to 2007, Applicant has \naccumulated over $89,766 in delinquent debt. A substantial amount of the debt relates \nto her failed truck driving business. She is unable to pay these debts due to her limited \nincome and medical issues. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties is too recent to apply this mitigating condition.  \nAll of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s health issues \ncontributed to her financial situation. The failure of her health insurance company further \naggravated Applicant\u2019s financial situation since she found herself responsible for a lot of \nmedical bills.  Currently, Applicant suffers from numerous health problems and is unable \nto get health insurance. There were circumstances beyond her control that adversely \naffected Applicant\u2019s finances. However, Applicant did not work for 14 months because \nshe was depressed about her health situation. While the trauma and anguish she \nexperienced over her health issues is understandable, Applicant\u2019s decision to not work \nfor 14 months was a factor within her control and was a major cause in her trucking \nbusiness\u2019 financial problems. It cannot be concluded that Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. While Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency who \nrecommended that she file for bankruptcy, she took no action towards filing for \nbankruptcy, claiming that she had no money to pay an attorney. Her delinquent \naccounts remain and it is unlikely that her financial situation will improve in the future.  \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant has not taken steps towards \nresolving her delinquent accounts.   \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n7 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s medical \nconditions and her inability to obtain health insurance. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character reference letters. However, a security risk remains because  \nApplicant has an overwhelming amount of debt which she is incapable of paying. An \ninability to pay one\u2019s debts remains a security concern under financial considerations. \nThe financial considerations concern is not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 63-year-old security guard who has worked for the same government contractor since 1994. She is a widow who raised five children. She has a high school diploma. She returned to school as an adult for some college course work. After her marriage, Applicant worked as a wife and mother. Her husband, then in his 30's, died in 1981.

On March 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating security concerns\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on June 17, 2008, Applicant denied all eleven\nallegations raised concerning allegedly delinquent debts. She also requested a hearing.\nDOHA received Applicant\u2019 request on June 10, 2008, and it was assigned to another\nadministrative judge. The case was reassigned to me for caseload considerations on\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n Tr. 17.\n1\n2\nJuly 10, 2008. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to an August 14, 2008,\nhearing date, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on July 17, 2008, to that effect.\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted four\nexhibits (Ex.), accepted into the record as Exs. 1-4 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted three exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-C without objection. Applicant was\nassisted by her daughter. Both Applicant and her daughter gave testimony. No other\nwitnesses were called and no exhibits were offered into evidence. Applicant was given\nthrough August 29, 2008, to submit any additional materials. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on September 4, 2008. The record was closed on September 8, 2008, with no\nadditional documents received. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and\ntestimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 63-year-old security guard who has worked for the same\ngovernment contractor since 1994. She is a widow who raised five children. She has a\nhigh school diploma. She returned to school as an adult for some college course work. \nAfter her marriage, Applicant worked as a wife and mother. Her husband, then in\nhis 30's, died in 1981. Applicant was left as a single parent living off Social Security and\nmeager benefits from his estate. She eventually found work as a cleaner. She worked\nhard to make sure her children were well taken care of and educated. \nOne of Applicant\u2019s daughters took a student loan for $5,000 in 1989 while in\ncollege. Because she was underage at the time, Applicant co-signed for the loan.\nBefore the daughter graduated in June 1991, the lender accidently started asking for\nrepayment prematurely, although the loan was not set for repayment until six months\nafter her graduation. The student aid office referred her to some forms to fill out to\ncorrect the situation and make sure she was not liable for the interest. The school told\nher not to pay the loan at that time. Neither the daughter nor Applicant heard about that\nparticular student loan until Applicant applied for a home mortgage in the spring of\n2008. In the interim, the daughter paid off all of her other student loans.1\nBetween 2001 and 2003, Applicant oversaw her elderly mother\u2019s medical care.\nAlthough the mother had some financial resources, Applicant was needed to co-sign a\nlease so her mother could rent an apartment. After about six months, Applicant had to\nleave her job because caring for her mother was so time consuming. Applicant\neventually sublet the lease to a niece in 2002 when Applicant\u2019s mother had to be placed\nin a nursing facility. Applicant continued with regular visits to visit her mother until, after\na brief time in the hospital, her mother died on New Years Eve of 2003. \nWhen Applicant applied for a home loan in the past year, she learned her niece\nhad broken the lease by vacating the apartment prematurely. As a consequence,\n\n Tr. 19.\n2\n Tr. 18; 22.\n3\n Tr. 30-32.\n4\n Tr. 22.\n5\n Ex. A (Monthly payment stub); Ex. B (Income contingent repayment letter); Tr. 27.\n6\n3\nApplicant was deemed liable for the lease balance. The apartment owner ultimately\naccepted a proposal that Applicant would repay the balance owed on the lease through\nmonthly $25 payments.  Applicant has been making payments in accordance with that\n2\nagreement.\nOver the years, Applicant and one of her daughters have been confused with\nother because they have the same name, lived at many of the same addresses, had\nthe same phone numbers, and other similarities.  This confusion is apparent on\n3\nApplicant\u2019s credit report in several entries regarding personal information. For example,\nit notes Applicant\u2019s profession as that of her daughter. Applicant\u2019s daughter similarly\nnotes that the telecommunications/telephone accounts noted on Applicant\u2019s credit\nreport are, in fact, hers.4\nAt issue in the SOR are 11 allegedly delinquent accounts:\nMedical Account Balance ($537 and $30) \u2013 Addressed/In Processing \u2013 These medical\nbills were submitted to Applicant\u2019s medical provider, which apparently declined to cover\nthem. She is awaiting verification that she is liable for them. (SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b).\nCell Phone Bill ($492) \u2013 Unaddressed \u2013 Applicant\u2019s daughter lost this phone in an\namusement park. She states that she immediately reported the lost phone, but that it\nwas not disabled. She claims subsequent calls on the phone were wrongfully billed to\nher mother, the Applicant.  (SOR \u00b6 1.c and \u00b6 1.e).\n5\nCredit Balance ($57) \u2013 Unaddressed \u2013 Applicant stated this account was paid, but\nfailed to provide evidence of payment. (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nCollection Account ($643) \u2013 Unaddressed \u2013 Applicant does not recognize this account\nentry. She believes it is an error on her credit report, but there is no documentation that\nthis has been disputed with either the company or any of the credit reporting bureaus.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.f).\nTelecommunications ($118) \u2013 Unaddressed \u2013 Applicant\u2019s daughter claims this is one of\nher telephone accounts. Applicant denies that it is her account. Applicant stated the\naccount was disputed, but provided no evidence of dispute. (SOR \u00b6 1.g).\nStudent Loan ($16,025) \u2013 In repayment \u2013 Applicant requested and received a\nrepayment plan to pay off her daughter\u2019s educational loan.  The terms call for payments\n6\n\n Tr. 25-29.\n7\n Ex. C (Creditor letter, dated July 22, 2008).\n8\n See Ex. 3 (Credit report, dated April 5, 2007).\n9\n Ex. D (Letter, dated June 10, 2008).\n10\n Tr. 30.\n11\n Tr. 43.\n12\n4\nof approximately $215 per month. Applicant demonstrated that the credit report marked\nas Government Exhibit 3, at 13, reflects the account as being currently in repayment.7\n(SOR \u00b6 1.h).\nCreditor ($4,905) \u2013 Paid \u2013 Applicant settled for a pay off of this account for $2,800. That\namount was tendered and the account is now satisfied.  (SOR \u00b6 1.i).\n8\nPhone Bill ($160) \u2013 Unaddressed \u2013 Applicant believes this is a repeat of the cell phone\nbill noted in \u00b6 1.c and \u00b6 1.e), above. It does not, however, have the same account\nnumber or date for the opening of the account as any of the above telecommunications\nor phone services.  Again, Applicant\u2019s daughter believes the cell phone bills are hers\n9\nand on her mother\u2019s credit report in error. (SOR \u00b6 1.j).\nApartment Lease Balance ($1,391) \u2013 In repayment \u2013 This is the apartment which was\nsublet to Applicant\u2019s niece. Applicant demonstrated she has a promissory note to repay\nthe balance that shows payments have been made.  She was to submit evidence of a\n10\nhistory of payment after the hearing, but none arrived prior to the closing of the record.11\n(SOR \u00b6 1.k).\nApplicant recently became a homeowner with the help of her daughter, who lives\nnearby. She has received financial counseling to the extent she has been thoroughly\ncounseled by her daughter, a finance professional with a major financial institution. The\ndaughter has 15 years of experience in a capacity not far akin from a personal\nbookkeeper and financial analyst. She is considered to have excellent skills in her\nprofession.  \n12\nApplicant\u2019s daughter has impressed upon Applicant the importance of being\nresponsible with credit and the importance of keeping her use of credit low. Starting\nearlier this year, she helped her mother devise a strategy for dealing with the debts\nnoted by the home lender and, subsequently, the SOR. Thus far they have worked out\ntwo repayment plans that are in progress and satisfied a major debt with a credit card.\nThe record shows execution of their strategy thus far has developed a meaningful track\nrecord which, when the daughter\u2019s phone bills are set aside, leaves less than $1,500\nyet unaddressed. \n\n Tr. 38.\n13\n Id.\n14\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n15\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n16\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n17\n5\nWith her mother living nearby, the daughter now discusses both her mother\u2019s\nphysical well-being and recent expenditures daily. She now regularly reviews her\nmother\u2019s accounts, expenses, and expenditures. Applicant\u2019s bills now go directly to her\ndaughter\u2019s home so that she can go over them with her mother.  With her daughter\u2019s\n13\nhelp, Applicant\u2019s credit cards have a zero balance at the end of each month.  Her\n14\ndaughter is committed to helping her mother both keep her home and her security\nclearance. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n15\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n16\n17\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n Id.\n18\n Id.\n19\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n20\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n21\n6\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n18\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n19\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n20\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.\u201d  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n21\nunder this guideline.  \nIn the spring of 2008, Applicant discovered she had several delinquent accounts\non her credit report. She was unaware of many of them, either because she assumed\nthey had been paid or because her role as co-signer had been exploited. Regardless,\nseveral of the accounts remain unpaid to date. Consequently, Financial Considerations\n\n See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1,\n22\n2007).\n7\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) apply.\nWith such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case\nagainst her and mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant was co-signer on an apartment lease for her aging mother. When\nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s health dramatically declined and she had to be moved into a\nnursing facility, her niece took over the lease. When, unbeknownst to Applicant, the\nniece abandoned the apartment and broke the lease, Applicant became responsible for\nthe outstanding balance. Similarly, Applicant was assigned responsibility for cell phone\naccounts properly belonging to her daughter. This apparently occurred because of\nidentity confusion on the part of the credit bureaus, which have repeatedly confused the\ntwo in other areas in the past. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 2,\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d) applies.\nApplicant and her daughter discovered most of the debts at issue when\nApplicant was considering the purchase of a home in the spring of 2008. With the help\nof her daughter, a finance professional, Applicant was advised about how to improve\nher credit, to address her debts, and to manage her finances in the future. Together,\nthey sought to address the debts in order of their significance. Applicant sought out a\nrepayment plan for the student loan, her largest debt, and the apartment lease. She\npaid off the second largest debt. Aside from those debts, Applicant needs to clean up\nher credit report by reporting inaccurate information and accounts. She also needs to\naddress several small accounts representing less than $1,275 in debt. However, given\nApplicant\u2019s income and the four months since receiving the SOR, significant strides\nhave been made and a meaningful track record developed.  FC MC 4, AG \u00b6 20(d),\n22\n(\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d) applies. To the extent her daughter\u2019s counseling and oversight can be\nconsidered counseling, and in light of the efforts thus far made to address Applicant\u2019s\ndebts, FC MC 3, AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol\u201d) applies. \nInasmuch as Applicant has presented mitigating conditions with regard to how\nher debts have arisen and has shown how she is systematically approaching the\nsatisfaction of those debts with the help of her daughter, a finance professional, she\nhas mitigated financial considerations security concerns.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\npublic trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature woman who, when widowed early, did what she could to\nsee that her children were raised well and educated. She has balanced her work as a\ncleaning person, and then a security guard, with her obligations as a mother and a\ndaughter. Before her daughter interceded, Applicant had little guidance as to how to\nsystematically approach her bills or how to organize and maintain records.\nConsequently, an SOR was issued regarding 11 allegedly delinquent debts. \nApplicant has demonstrated a meaningful track record of debt resolution. She\nsought out a repayment plan for the student loan she co-signed for her daughter. She is\nin repayment on that loan. She has also entered into a settlement agreement and then\npaid off her second largest debt in July 2008. Although Applicant failed to demonstrate\na monthly history of timely payment on the apartment complex obligation, she did\ndemonstrate that a promissory note has been executed and that payments were being\nmade. Not counting various telecommunications accounts which are apparently part of\na credit report mix-up with her daughter\u2019s identity, Applicant leaves a manageable sum\nof well under $1,275 in accounts yet unaddressed.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter is a finance professional with 15 years of experience.\nWithin the past six months, she has interceded in her mother\u2019s life as an informal\nbookkeeper and financial mentor. She lives near her mother and the two have daily\ncontact. They meet whenever questions or issues regarding money arise. The daughter\nreenforces organization and reasoned expenditures, finances, and the importance of\ntimely repayment as the keys to maintaining her home and her job. All bills go through\n\n9\nthe daughter, and the two discuss their monthly payments and budget. With her help,\nApplicant\u2019s daughter hopes to help complete Applicant\u2019s fulfillment of her financial\nobligations and clear up errors on her credit report. Given her recent help to make her\nmother a homeowner, Applicant\u2019s prospects look good with regard to honoring her two\nremaining repayment plans and methodically addressing those accounts yet to be\nsatisfied. Between the Applicant\u2019s efforts thus far and her daughter\u2019s on-going\nguidance, Applicant has mitigated security concerns. I conclude it is clearly consistent\nwith national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nSeptember 9, 2008\n\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR), at 1-2; Attachments to rebuttal.\n1\nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance, dated October 17, 2006) at 1, 2, 4.\n2\nItem 1 (Statement of Reasons) at 1-2; Item 6 (Credit Report, dated October 17, 2006); Item 7 (Credit Report,\n3\ndated January 2, 2008); Item 8 (Credit Report, dated April 22, 2008).\nItem 4, supra note 1, at 4-5.\n4\n2\nApplicant received the SOR On March 31, 2008. He submitted a notarized,\nwritten response to the SOR allegations dated April 2, 2008, and requested a decision\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on May 14, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on June 9,\n2008. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response and additional\nevidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on August 15, 2008. The government\nsubmitted eight exhibits, which have been marked as Items 1-8 and admitted into the\nrecord.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 2, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.l. He denied the remaining allegations. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.1\nApplicant is 42 years old. He works for a Department of Defense contractor as a\ndistribution clerk. He is divorced.2\nIn November 2000, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 Petition for Bankruptcy. The court\ndischarged his debts in April 2002. Since his bankruptcy discharge, he has incurred\nadditional debts, including two judgments against him by a utility company and a car\ndealer. His unpaid bills total $11,044, of which $5,693 is for medical bills, $2,484 is for\ncredit cards, and $902 is for telephone bills.  \n3\nApplicant provided documentation which verifies that he paid the two judgments\nagainst him. He paid the utility judgment in 2007 and the car dealer judgment in 2006.\nHe has not provided any documentation reflecting payment of his other debts or a\nrepayment plan for these debts. He has not provided any documentation showing his\ncurrent income and expenses, nor offered an explanation as to how these debts\noccurred.4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n3\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated more delinquent debt after his bankruptcy\ndischarge, which he has been unable to pay for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions in AG\u00b6 20(a)-(f) and concluded that\nnone are applicable in this case as to the debts he admits owing. Applicant has\nestablished he paid the two judgments, He paid the car dealer judgment through\ngarnishment and the utility judgment after being contacted by a collection attorney.\nThus, allegations 1.a and 1.b are found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \n\n5\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case as well as the above whole person\nfactors. Since this record contains little evidence, I have no information to provide a\ngood whole person analysis. His debts remain unpaid. He has not provided a reason for\nthese debts nor has he provided any information on his current financial circumstances.\nI find that Applicant has not presented evidence which mitigates the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains one allegation under the drug involvement guideline that Applicant admitted. The alcohol consumption guideline contains three allegations. Applicant admitted subparagraphs SOR 2.a. and 2.b., but denied subparagraph 2.c. He did not provide reasons why he admitted subparagraphs 1.a., 2.a., and 2.b., and why he denied subparagraph 2c. Applicant is 24 years old and single. He has been employed as a financial analyst by a defense contractor since July 2007. Drug Involvement During his interview in September 2007 with an investigator, Applicant discussed his drug and alcohol use. On December 21, 2007 (Item 4, answers to interrogatories), he officially answered questions about his drug and alcohol use. In addition, he adopted (acknowledged as correct the information he provided in the September 2007 interview) the information he provided to the investigator in his September 2007 interview concerning his drug and alcohol use was true. The frequency of his alcohol use and frequency of intoxication after December 2006 is more in his answers to interrogatories in December 2007 than in his interview in September 2007. According to his September 2007 interview, Applicant began using marijuana in August/fall of 1999 in high school. He and a high school friend purchased approximately $5.00 of marijuana from a friend. The two smoked a pipe\u2019s worth of marijuana, but the drug had no effect on Applicant. About two years later while working as a lifeguard at an ",

On February 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug\ninvolvement (Guideline H) and alcohol consumption (Guideline E). The action was taken\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 29, 2008, and requested\na decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File\nof Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on April 8, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on April\nISCR Case No. 07-16007\nJuly 8, 2008\n\n2\n21, 2008. His response was due May 21, 2008. No response was received by DOHA.\nThe case file was assigned to me on June 24, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains one allegation under the drug involvement guideline that\nApplicant admitted. The alcohol consumption guideline contains three allegations.\nApplicant admitted subparagraphs SOR 2.a. and 2.b., but denied subparagraph 2.c. He\ndid not provide reasons why he admitted subparagraphs 1.a., 2.a., and 2.b., and why he\ndenied subparagraph 2c. Applicant is 24 years old and single. He has been employed\nas a financial analyst by a defense contractor since July 2007. \nDrug Involvement\nDuring his interview in September 2007 with an investigator, Applicant discussed\nhis drug and alcohol use. On December 21, 2007 (Item 4, answers to interrogatories),\nhe officially answered questions about his drug and alcohol use. In addition, he adopted\n(acknowledged as correct the information he provided in the September 2007 interview)\nthe information he provided to the investigator in his September 2007 interview\nconcerning his drug and alcohol use was true. The frequency of his alcohol use and\nfrequency of intoxication after December 2006 is more in his answers to interrogatories\nin December 2007 than in his interview in September 2007. \nAccording to his September 2007 interview, Applicant began using marijuana in\nAugust/fall of 1999 in high school. He and a high school friend purchased approximately\n$5.00 of marijuana from a friend. The two smoked a pipe\u2019s worth of marijuana, but the\ndrug had no effect on Applicant. About two years later while working as a lifeguard at an\napartment complex, Applicant and a friend smoked marijuana about once a week in\nJune, July, and August 2001, by sharing a pipe to ingest the drug. The marijuana made\nApplicant feel euphoric and light-headed. He paid the friend between $5.00 and $10.00\nto assist in purchasing the drug. His use of the drug stopped when he returned for his\nlast year of high school in September 2001. \nApplicant did not recall using marijuana until he started college in September\n2002. He took a few puffs from a pipe at a party his first year of college. His next use of\nthe drug was in September 2003 at his apartment. \nThe next time Applicant used marijuana was in March 2006, during a seven-day\nvacation with friends in the Carribean. He and his friends purchased between $60.00\nand $100.00 for the drug. Applicant recalls smoking about once or twice a day during\nthe seven-day trip. The marijuana he ingested on this trip seemed to be stronger than\nany other he had experienced to date. Applicant was 23 years old the next time he used\nmarijuana in March 2007. His use in Europe occurred during a two-day visit to a city\nwhere marijuana use is legal. He purchased the drug for about $5.00, and smoked it\neither in a pipe or in a cigarette. According to his answers to interrogatories in\nDecember 2007 (Item 4), Applicant has used no marijuana since March 2007. He never\n\n3\nconsidered drug use a principle part of his life. He never sold marijuana or any other\nkind of drug. He was never cited for a drug related offense, and never had a positive\ndrug test. \nAlcohol Consumption\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s September 2007 interview, he started drinking in 1998\nwhen he was 15 years old. In his third and fourth years of high school, he drank more\nfrequently, probably two or three weekends a month. On those occasions, he would\nconsume about five or six beers or a similar number of mixed drinks. The level of\nconsumption would make him intoxicated. \nIn the summer before college, he did not drink much at all. From August 2002\nthrough December 2006, Applicant consumed between 3 beers and 10 beers, or a\nsimilar number of mixed drinks about three times a week. He drank to intoxication about\nonce each weekend. In the summer months between school years, he drank on a\nweekend night, and he usually reached intoxication on this same night. Some summer\nweekends he did not drink at all. \nAfter graduating from college (Item 4, September 2007 interview), Applicant\ndrank one weekend night per month, and got intoxicated on that night also. According to\nthe information he provided in his answers to interrogatories in December 2007. (Item\n4), his drinking increased to every Friday and/or Saturday night. He became intoxicated\nseveral times a month. \nAccording to his September 2007 interview, Applicant does not believe he is an\nalcoholic. He defines an alcoholic as one who cannot function without alcohol. Alcohol\nhas never negatively impacted his finances or his occupational functioning. He never\nhas been charged with an alcohol-related offense. He does not believe he was charged\nwith an alcohol offense in the fall of 2004. (SOR 2.c.) \nAccording to Item 4 (answers to interrogatories provided in December 21, 2007),\nApplicant last consumed alcohol about six days before he provided the responses to the\ninterrogatories on December 21, 2007. The last time he was intoxicated was on\nNovember 21, 2007. Alcohol use puts Applicant in a good mood, while making him\nrelaxed. He intends to drink alcohol in the future. He has never been treated for his\nalcohol use. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant graduated from college in December 2006 with a Bachelor\u2019s degree.\nHe provided no independent evidence substantiating his assertion that he stopped using\nmarijuana in March 2007.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nDrug Involvement (DI)\nUsing drugs brings the user\u2019s trustworthiness into question while casting a pall\nover his ability to comply with the law.\n\n5\nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\nAlcohol consumption may impair a person\u2019s judgment and lead to security\nviolations. \nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement (DI)\n24. The Concern. \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability tor willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s sporadic use of marijuana on approximately 20 occasions between\n1999 and March 2007 activates DI disqualifying condition (DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse)\nWhile his March 2007 use evokes some residual security concerns because of its\nrecency, the period of use that is most troubling is the seven-day abuse in March 2006,\nwhen he was using marijuana once or twice a day.\nThe DI guideline contains two mitigating conditions (MC) that may mitigate the\ncircumstances of this case. The recency of his drug use over the last two years renders\nthe first element of DI MC 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement) inapplicable. However,\nApplicant receives significant benefit from the second clause of DI MC 26.a., because\nhis drug use has been infrequent since September 2003.\nEven though Applicant does not meet all elements of DI MC 26.b. (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from\ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where\ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; a signed written statement of\nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation), I am convinced that he\nhas undergone a maturation process that has motivated him to move on with his life.\nThe DI guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAlcohol Consumption (AC)\n21. The Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant started using alcohol in 1998 when he was 15 years old, his\nalcohol consumption did not really become significant until he was in college.\nApplicant\u2019s consumption at the levels disclosed demonstrates conduct that falls within\nAC DC 21.c. (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\n\n Subparagraph 2.c. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. The government presented no evidence to support this\n1\nallegation. Applicant does not recall being cited for any offense in January 2005. \n6\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent) From August 2002 to December 2006, Applicant consumed\nsufficient amounts of alcohol (up to ten beers or a similar number of mixed drinks) three\ntimes a month to become intoxicated on each occasion. Though he reduced his drinking\nto one weekend night (usually drinking to intoxication on that weekend night) in the\nsummer months while he was away from school, his binge drinking practice continued\nwhether he was in school or on summer break. \nSince his graduation from college in December 2006, Applicant claims (according\nto his September 2007 interview that he acknowledged as true in the last page of Item\n4) he was drinking only one weekend night a month. Based on his drinking pattern while\nin college, it is reasonable to infer he was still consuming a binge level of beer or alcohol\nduring that weekend night. However, according to his answers to interrogatories\nprovided in December 2007 (Item 4), since December 2006, his drinking increased to\none or two times a week, and he drank to intoxication several times a month. The last\ntime he drank alcohol was about a week before his interview with an investigator, and\nthe last time he was intoxicated was about a month before he was interviewed on\nDecember 21, 2007. \nAC MC 23.a. (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not\napplicable as Applicant continues to drink alcohol at binge levels, and appears to have\nresumed his consumption to the levels similar to his college days. With no independent\nevidence from his supervisors, friends, or family to support Applicant\u2019s claims regarding\nthe nature, scope, and pattern of his alcohol use, I am unable to find AC MC 23.a. or the\nAC guideline, in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAC MC 23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use if an\nalcohol abuser) is not applicable either. Even though Applicant was in college between\n2002 and December 2006, drinking up to 10 beers or mixed drinks three times a month\nconstitutes alcohol consumption at an abusive level because it often leads to poor\njudgment. Given the four-year period of alcohol abuse, an applicant is responsible\nunder AC MC 23.b. to present evidence that demonstrates he understands his alcohol\nabuse issues, and he has taken action to overcome the problem. Whether an applicant\ndrinks intoxicating levels of alcohol once a month, or three times a month, or several\ntimes a month, when he is intoxicated, he is not in a position to exercise the judgment\nnecessary for safeguarding classified information and/or complying with security\nregulations. Given his failure to provide independent evidence to support his position\nthat he does not have an alcohol problem, Applicant has not mitigated the AC\nguideline.  \n1\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine\ngeneral policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nFactor 6 (the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavior changes)\nand Factor 9 (the likelihood of continuation or recurrence) are critical factors in this\ncase. Applicant presented no independent evidence which shows rehabilitation or\nbehavioral changes in his conduct that facilitates abstinence or control over his\nconsumption of alcohol. Applicant has not satisfied his burden of persuasion under the\nAC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Brian Cruz, Esquire\nMcKenna Long & Aldridge\nJune 23, 2008 \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated June 15,\n2007.  On February 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 26, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on April 29, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 12, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for June 9, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented two\nexhibits.  The Applicant presented fifteen exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The\nofficial transcript (Tr.) was received on June 18, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 25 years old and engaged to be married.  He has a Bachelors\nDegree in Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Payload Systems\nEngineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted that he has used marijuana less than 25 times between\nAugust 2003 through May 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  He has never purchased or\nsold marijuana or used any other illegal drug.  (Tr. p. 25).  In his answers to\ninterrogatories dated January 8, 2008, he indicated that he has used marijuana at least\n20 times.  (Government Exhibit 2).  \nThe Applicant was Valedictorian of his high school and then attended a\nprestigious University where he graduated with a GPA of 3.667.  He explained that he\nfirst used marijuana in 2003, while attending college, and while studying abroad in\nIreland for a year.  He met some Irish citizens who offered it to him, and he used it with\nthem at social gatherings.  When he returned from Ireland to the United States in 2004,\nhe continued to use marijuana on a couple of occasions, again at a party or social event\nwhere a friend, or friend of a friend, offered him marijuana.  (Tr. p. 24).  He last used\nmarijuana at his going away party in May 2007, when it was offered to him, even though\nhe knew at the time that he was going to be working for a defense contractor that\nprohibited illegal drug use.  The Applicant attributes his use of marijuana as an\naberration, a serious lapse in judgement, and a stupid mistake that will never happen\nagain.  \nSince moving to a new state to start his job with the defense contractor, the\nApplicant has made new friends who do not use illegal drugs, and is involved in a more\nactive lifestyle.  He no longer associates with anyone that uses illegal drugs.  He shares\na home, that he is renting, together with three other engineers from his company who\nhold security clearances and do not use illegal drugs. He is currently engaged to be\nmarried, and his fianc\u00e9 does not use any illegal drugs of any sort.  He admits that he\nnow has a \u201cfantastic job\u201d and a \u201cbeautiful fianc\u00e9\u201d that he will not jeopardize under any\ncircumstances.  For investment purposes, he has purchased a house in another state\nthat he is renting to tenants.  He regrets using marijuana in the past and indicates that\nhe will never use any illegal drugs again.   \nHe understands the law and DoD policy that prohibits the use of any illegal\ndrugs.  He understands that holding a security clearance is a privilege and not a right.\nHe realizes that he has worked too hard establishing his career and does not ever want\nto do anything to jeopardize it.  He has now committed himself to a drug free lifestyle.    \n  \nFive letters of recommendation submitted by various individuals who know the\nApplicant, including his supervisor, coworkers and friends, collectively reflect that the\n\n3\nApplicant is intelligent, responsible, conscientious, organized, and thorough.  He is\nconsidered to be a person who upholds the values of leadership, integrity, loyalty, and\ndependability.  He always produces quality work.  He has regularly handled proprietary\ndocumentation as part of his job and has never mishandled the information in any way.\nHe is said to have a high respect for company rules, procedures and standards.  The\nApplicant is held in such high esteem by the company that he was chosen to represent\nthe company at recruiting events.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E).     \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal for 2007 reflects that he either \u201cmeets\u201d or\n\u201cexceeds expectations\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).\nThe Applicant has received a number of achievement awards from his company,\nwhich were received November 1, 2007, December 3, 2007, December 11, 2007,\nMarch 27, 2008 and most recently on May 17, 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G through K).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24.  The Concern.  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n\n4\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about th his performance evaluation reflects\nthat he is a valuable asset to his company e person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\n\n5\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline H of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, disqualifying conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, and 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution or possession of drug paraphernalia, apply.  However,\nmitigating condition 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment also applies.  \nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use started in college and continued until 2007,\nuntil he became employed in his field of study, that of an Engineer.  Applicant\u2019s last use\nof marijuana occurred in 2007, just over a year ago.  His illegal drug use of the past was\nobviously an aberration given his outstanding academic achievements and his favorable\nwork performance.  Since starting to work for the DoD, he has matured and\nunderstands the responsibilities involved in holding a security clearance.  He is trusted\nby his supervisor and coworkers on the job, and is currently living with three engineers\nfrom the company who all hold security clearances and do not tolerate drug use of any\nkind.  He admits his mistakes of the past and realizes that it can never happen again.\nHe credibly testified that he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug in the future.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept by considering the totality of\nthe Applicant\u2019s conduct and all of the circumstances, using the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed above.  The Applicant is a young, intelligent individual who\ndisplayed poor judgment in the past.  Over the past year, he has grown up, matured,\nand realizes his mistakes.  He is now a home owner, is engaged to be married, and\nunderstands the responsibilities that go along with it.  His performance evaluation\n\n6\nreflects that he is a valuable asset to his company.  He understands the privilege and\nseriousness of holding a security clearance and will do nothing to jeopardize it.  Under\nthe particular facts of this case, I do not find his past use of marijuana to be recent or of\nsecurity significance (factor A(3)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(factor A(8)).      \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the SOR.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn March 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 2, 2008, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on June 6, 2008 and was scheduled for hearing on July 14,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 14, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and 11 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.)\nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n2\nwas received on July 21, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his payoff of his two of his listed debts in the SOR and his\ndebt consolidation firm\u2019s acceptance of the payments in satisfaction of his debts with the\ncreditors.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the\nrecord.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documented\npayments of his listed debts with creditors 1.c and 1.e and his debt consolidation firm\u2019s\nacceptance of his payments toward satisfaction of the covered debts.  His post-hearing\nexhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant accumulated five debts exceeding $30,000.00.  For\nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the listed debts but denied the\nallegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b on the grounds Applicant paid the\ndebts to a collection agency in August 2007 an dis able to document the payments.  He\nclaims he is enrolled with a debt consolidation firm and is saving toward payment of\nthese debts through his debt consolidation firm.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old munitions lead for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is married with three children: two daughters (ages 19 and 22) and a\nson (age 16).  His oldest daughter is a recent university graduate who funded her\ncollege education on a golf scholarship (R.T., at 62); while his youngest daughter is an\nenlistee in the Air Force, who is taking college credits (R.T., at 63). His son (age 16)\nlives at home and receives his financial support (R.T., at 40).  Applicant served in the ir\nForce for almost 22 years before his retirement in January 1997 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 38-\n41).  He has almost two years of college credit and is just one class away from receiving\nhis AA degree.\nApplicant maintained good credit while in the Air Force but had difficulty\naccumulating any savings for his retirement (R.T., at 52).  Following his Air Force\nretirement, he and his wife bought a home (R.T., at 52-53).  Having just started a new\njob in the private sector, he and his wife were confident of maintaining their mortgage\npayments and household obligations (R.T., at 52).  Neither Applicant nor his wife\nanticipated major home repairs within the first few years of their purchase.  But soon\nafter they moved into the home, they encountered furnace problems and roof leaks that\n\n3\nrequired expensive repairs (estimated to be about $18,000).  These were expenditures\nthat Applicant and his wife had not anticipated, but were necessary (R.T., at 52-54).\nBy 2006, Applicant\u2019s debts had increased significantly. Altogether, he\naccumulated five debts exceeding $31,000.00.   Four of the five debts involve two\ncreditors (two credit card accounts with each of the identified two creditors).  Unable to\nbudget effectively to cover his accumulated debts, Applicant sought debt counseling\nwith a recognized debt counseling firm (see ex. N; R.T., at 31-36).  This firm permitted\napplicant to choose his own accounts for consolidation inclusion.  With a $5,000.00\nadvance from his oldest daughter (with no repayment obligations, but repayment\nexpectancies, nonetheless), he completed a 36-month payment agreement with a debt\nconsolidation firm in February 2006 (see ex. A; R.T., at 49-50).  Under the terms of his\nrepayment agreement with this firm, he paid $5,600.00 (which included an $1,800.00\nup-front fee) to the firm in the first six months of his payment arrangement for ensuing\napportionment to his listed creditors over a 21-month time frame (R.T., at 56-61).  \nApplicant documents payment of four of his five six listed debts (see exs. B\nthrough H, L and M; R.T., at 45-47).  His payments to creditors 1.a and 1.b were\nactually satisfied in August 2007 and corroborated in January 2008 (see exs. B through\nG).  After saving $100.00 a month to accumulate funds to pay off his creditor 1.c debt\n(for $4,655.00), Applicant was able to pay off this debt as well with saved funds paid\nover to his debt consolidation firm in July 2008 (see exs. H, L and M ; R.T., at 33).  He is\nable to document keeping his promise to pay his creditor 1.e debt (for $5,265.00) as\nwell (see exs J, N and O; R.T., at 48-49).  The only creditor that Applicant has not been\nable to satisfy in full is his creditor 1.d debt.  Applicant was successful in setting up a\npayment plan with this creditor and documents payments on this account through his\ncredit consolidation firm (see exs. I and O; R.T., at 33).  \nTo ensure that he is able to stay atop his finances in the future, Applicant has set\nup a personal budget to allocate his current expenses and debts from his estimated net\nincome resources.  His estimated adjusted gross income is $63,943.81 for the 2008\ncalendar year, which works out to about $4,800.00 a month (ex. K; R.T., at 64).  Against\nthis calculated income stream, he estimates expenses and debt payment aggregates of\n$63,058.56.  This leaves him with a net remainder of $885.25, which can vary up or\ndown, depending on necessary adjustments to his income and expense/debt loads\nduring the calendar year (R.T., at 65-79).  Applicant assures that he will have satisfied\nhis remaining SOR debt by March 2009, and credits his enrollment with his debt\nconsolidation firm with his successful resolution of his debt problem.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\n\n4\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a\nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also\na security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.  See Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n5\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an experienced munitions leader with his defense contractor with an\nhonorable discharge from the Air Force.  He accumulated a number of credit card debts\nover a four-year period spanning 2002 and 2006 after starting a new job due to\nunanticipated roofing repairs on a newly purchased home and en ensuing downturn in\nthe real estate economy.  After briefly considering a bankruptcy alternative, he chose a\ndebt consolidation firm to assist him in resolving his delinquent debts.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability to address most of these debts\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC  \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC\n\u00b6 19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to unanticipated home repairs following\nhis purchase of a home in 2006 just after starting a new job. All of his debts are\nconsumer-related credit card accounts that incurred significant interest accumulations\nonce he fell behind in his monthly payments.\nBefore receiving the SOR, Applicant  initiated considerable efforts to resolve the\ndebts through a debt consolidation firm.  Specifically, he is able to document satisfaction\nof four of his listed debts and is well on his way to satisfying his fifth and final listed debt\nthrough his continued savings and the assistance of his debt consolidation firm.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with his\nunanticipated need for home repairs just after joining his current defense contractor and\nensuing downturn in the real estate market, and his exhibited considerable efforts\npaying his debts with his budgeted resources, Applicant may rely on MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial considerations.  Extenuating\ncircumstances continue to impact Applicant in her current efforts to resolve his\naccumulated debts.  \n\n6\nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on his exhibited substantial\nefforts paying his debts with his budgeted resources.  Payment of his debts warrants\napplication of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve his debts.\u201d  Applicant has addressed all of his debts in a\nsubstantial way and provides documentation of payment in full of his four of his five\nlisted debts and an earnest payment plan with the fifth and final creditor that he expects\nto complete in March 2009.  Prospects for Applicant\u2019s successful completion of his\npayment plan with this creditor are excellent based on his repayment record to date.\nApplicant received considerable financial counseling from the debt consolidation\nfirm he chose to work with in 2006.  He is to be credited with earnestly looking for\nsources of financial advice with the resources available to him and taking productive\nadvantage of the public advice he received from his debt consolidation firm in\naddressing his debts.  He may take advantage MC \u00b6 20\u00a9), \u201cthe person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Based on his initiated efforts to date,\nprospects for his gaining important insights in handling his finances in the future appear\nto be promising.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d in the management of an applicant\u2019s finances, which\ncertainly includes evidence of actual debt reduction through repayments.  See ISCR\nCase No. 05-01920, at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s good-faith debt\nrepayment does not require, though, that he demonstrate repayment of each and every\nlisted debt.  All that is required is that the applicant demonstrate that he developed a\nplan to resolve his debts and taken significant actions to implement the plan.  See ISCR\nCase No. 07-16013, at 2 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-09684, at 2 (App.\nBd. July 6, 2006).  Applicant meets these Appeal Board requirements in this case.\nFrom a whole person standpoint, Applicant presents a history of honorable Air\nForce service and retirement and many years of demonstrated good judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness while holding a security clearance.  His children have profited\nconsiderably from his excellent parental example.  His strong repayment initiatives\nreflect responsible and mature judgment and corrective measures that merit the\nGovernment\u2019s renewed confidence in his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations and his documented steps taken to resolve them, Applicant\n\n7\nmitigates security concerns related to his listed debt delinquencies.  Favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.e of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On July 10, 2008, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Furthermore, the Judge has articulated a satisfactory explanation for her conclusion that\n1\nApplicant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion regarding the Guideline E security concern.\nSee Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 (After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns);  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d).  In this regard, the Board notes that\nApplicant chose to have the case decided upon the written record, with the  result that his credibility\ncould not be evaluated in the context of a hearing.  See ISCR Case No. 08-00899 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.\n29, 2008).  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline E is sustainable.  In light of\n\nthis conclusion, the Board need not address the Guideline F issues raised on appeal.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

Finding no error, we affirm. The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 58 years old and holds a B.S. degree in business and management. He served in the U.S. military from 1969 to 1977 and has held a security clearance since 1969. Applicant has delinquent debts exceeding $23,000, which originated during a period of underemployment from 2001 until 2004. The debts resulted from his use of three credit cards to pay living expenses. These debts are owed to two separate creditors and were unpaid as of the close of the record. When completing his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to questions inquiring about debts over 90 days and 180 days. These answers were not true, in light of the ongoing debts described above. Additionally, Applicant had previously filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, which was subsequently dismissed due to his failure to comply with the terms of the payment plan.

His eligibility\nfor a security clearance is denied.\nOn May 15, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nalleging security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct. DOHA\u2019s action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJuly 10, 2008\n\n2\nOn March 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that\nhis case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The government compiled its\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 7, 2008. The FORM contained documents\nidentified as Items 1 through 15.  By letter dated May 14, 2008, a copy of the FORM\nwas forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or\nobjections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant filed an undated response consisting of a\nfour page rebuttal and nine attachments. I marked these documents as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits (Ex.) A through K . Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s exhibits or\nto his response to the FORM, and I have admitted them to the record of this case. On\nJune 27, 2008, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  \nEvidentiary Ruling\nThe government offered, as Item 15 of the FORM, the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) Record of Investigation, which included a summary by an OPM\ninvestigator of an unsworn interview with Applicant on July 11, 2007 and interviews and\ncommunications with Applicant\u2019s creditors. The government conceded that Item 15\nmight be inadmissible under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive if Applicant objected to its\ninclusion and cited specific grounds for its exclusion. (See FORM at 2, Fn 1.)  Applicant,\nwho appeared pro se and is not trained in the law, did not object to the admission of\nItem 15.\n  \nParagraph E.3.1.20 of the Directive reads as follows:\nOfficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of\nbusiness, other than DoD personnel background reports of investigation\n(ROI), may be received and considered by the Administrative Judge\nwithout authenticating witnesses, provided that such information has been\nfurnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its responsibilities in\nconnection with assisting the Secretary of Defense, or the Department or\nAgency head concerned, to safeguard classified information within\nindustry under E. O. 10865 . . .. An ROI may be received with an\nauthenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible under the\nFederal Rules of Evidence (28 U.S.C. 101 et seq . . . ).\nAdditionally, \u00b6 4.3.3 of the Directive states that it is DoD policy that an applicant\nreceive \u201c[n]otice of the right to a hearing and the opportunity to cross-examine persons\nproviding information adverse to the applicant.\u201d I have reviewed relevant DoD policy as\nexpressed in \u00b6\u00b6 E.3.1.20 and 4.3.3, the government\u2019s argument for admission of Item\n15, the proffered evidence, and Applicant\u2019s silence on the matter. I conclude that Item\n15 is inadmissible in this case.  \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial\nConsiderations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6I 1.a. through 1.f.) (Item 1.) Additionally, the SOR alleges\n\n3\nunder AG E, Personal Conduct, that Applicant falsified answers about his financial\nobligations on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) he executed in\nMay 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a.)  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b., 1.c.,\n1.d., and 1.f.  He denied the debt alleged at \u00b6 1.e and asserted it had been satisfied. He\ndenied the Guideline E allegation.  \nApplicant is 58 years old and never married. He holds a bachelor of science\ndegree in business and management. From 1969 to 1977 he served in the U.S. military.\nHe received an honorable discharge in 1977. He has held a security clearance since\n1969.  (Item 7; Item 6.)\nFrom December 1979 to July 2001, he was employed as a logistics analyst by\ngovernment contractor A. He was laid off by his employer in July 2001. His yearly salary\nwhen he was laid off was $57,500.  Applicant was unemployed until August 2002, when\nhe took a job with an automotive dealer. He worked for the automotive dealer until\nFebruary or March 2003, when he was again unemployed. From June or July 2003 until\nJanuary 2004, he worked for two other automotive dealers. He earned about $250 a\nweek when he was employed by the automotive dealers. During this time of under-\nemployment, Applicant charged miscellaneous living expenses to three credit cards.  He\nwas living with a girlfriend who also provided him with financial support. (Item 7; Item 8;\nEx. A.) \nIn January 2004, Applicant accepted a position as an analyst with government\ncontractor B. He worked for employer B until April 2005, when he took a job with\nemployer C. Employer C laid him off in February 2006. He was unemployed until\nOctober 2006, when he was again hired by government contractor B. (Item 7; Item 9.)\nIn 1991, when he was working for employer A, Applicant filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy protection. He listed total secured debts of $109,133.35 and total unsecured\ndebts of $12,745.70. Under the plan approved by the bankruptcy court, Applicant\ncommitted to a payment plan of $530 a month for 60 months in order to satisfy his\ncreditors. Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 case was dismissed on January 2, 1996, when he\nfailed to meet the terms of his payment plan. In moving for dismissal, Applicant\ncommitted to establishing \u201ca repayment schedule with the unsecured creditors similar to\nthat which existed prior to the filing of his case.\u201d  Eighteen months later, in June 1997,\nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau report showed he was responsible for debts in collection and\ncharge-off status totaling $22,359. (Item 10; Item 11.)\nOn January 17, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator\nfrom OPM and provided an affidavit. In the affidavit, Appellant stated that he used three\ncredit cards to pay his living expenses between 2001 and the first half of 2004. The\ndebts he accrued by using these three credit cards were alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b.,\nand 1.e. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that his debts to the creditors\nidentified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1(a) and 1(b) remained unpaid.  He asserted he had satisfied his\ndebt to the creditor alleged at SOR \u00b61.e.  In his affidavit, Applicant also stated:\n\n4\nIn January of 2004, I began employment with my current employer. I am\nearning a decent salary and it is my intention to pay my outstanding debts\nover a period of time. I have not done so previously because I did not\nhave any contact information for my creditors.  After talking to the special\ninvestigator helping me to prepare this affidavit, I now have contact\ninformation for these creditors and I intend to contact them in order to\nmake arrangements to pay off my debt. I am not going to ignore my\nfinancial responsibilities.\n(Item 8.)\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he owed a creditor approximately\n$9,438 on an account placed for collection and, as of January 25, 2008, the debt had\nnot been paid. (SOR, \u00b6 1.a.)  He also admitted a debt of $13,594 to another creditor,\nwhich, as of January 25, 2008, had not been satisfied. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Additionally,\nApplicant admitted two medical debts, one for $250 and one for $579, which had not\nbeen satisfied as of May 24, 2007. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d.) He denied a debt of $1,675 to\na creditor and claimed the debt had been satisfied in 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) However, in his\nanswer to the SOR, he failed to provide documentary evidence to corroborate his claim.\n(Item 3.)\nBy letter dated April 14, 2008, Applicant supplemented his answer to the SOR.\nHe stated he had contacted the successor creditor for the debt identified at SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nHe further stated the creditor had reduced the amount of the debt owed to $6,179.13.\nApplicant stated he had made one payment in an unspecified amount \u201caround April 7,\n2008.\u201d Applicant provided no documentation to corroborate his statements that he had\npaid the creditor and that the creditor had reduced the amount of the debt. In his\nresponse to the FORM, Applicant provided a  communication from the creditor stating it\nwould debit his bank account for $125 on June 2, 2008. The communication showed a\nbalance of $5,804.13. (Item 4.)\nIn his April 14, 2008 letter, Applicant also stated he had contacted the creditor\nidentified in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He reported that the creditor had reduced the amount of the\ndebt from $13,594 to $6,933.19. He failed to provide documentation to corroborate his\nstatement that the debt had been reduced by the creditor. He also stated he intended to\nmake a payment to the creditor \u201caround April 21, 2008.\u201d He did not provide receipts\nfrom the creditor to acknowledge payments made.\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation to corroborate\nhis statement that he had paid the debt alleged at SOR 1.d. The documentation showed\nthe creditor had placed the debt for collection in November 2003. The creditor\nacknowledged payment from Applicant on May 19, 2008. A credit bureau report dated\nJune 7, 2008 showed the debt had been paid in full. (Ex. C; Ex. G.) \n\n5\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant also provided a computer print showing\npayment in full of a medical debt of $250 on May 8, 2008. The debt was alleged at SOR\n\u00b6 1.c. The computer print showed the debt had been incurred in February 2003. (Ex. D.)\nIn addition, in his response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation to\ncorroborate his statement that he had satisfied the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Ex. E.)\nApplicant provided no evidence that he had received financial counseling. In a\npersonal financial statement prepared at DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant reported assets of\n$104,000.  (Item 9.)\nApplicant completed and certified an SF-86 on May 15, 2007.  Section 28a on\nthe SF-86 reads as follows: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 130 days\ndelinquent on any debt?\u201d  Section 28b on the SF-86 reads: \u201cAre you currently over 90\ndays delinquent on any debt?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Sections 28a and 28b.  In\nhis answer to the SOR, he stated: \u201cI did not know there were outstanding debts on my\ncredit report until recently. I had not done a Credit Report search in over 7 years.\u201d  In his\nresponse to the FORM, Applicant stated he was not aware of his delinquent debts until\nhis discussion with the authorized investigator from OPM in January 2005.  (Item 3; Item\n7; Item 8; Response to FORM at 2.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to\nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, the guidelines take\ncognizance of the complexities of human behavior and are applied in conjunction with\nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. The adjudicative process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.  See A G \u00b6\n2.(c).\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. A G \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Adjudicative Guideline F, & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\n& 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated multiple debts and was unable to pay his\nfinancial obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several conditions could mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. Unresolved financial delinquency\n\n7\nmight be resolved if it happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(a))  Additionally,\nunresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, such as loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. (Guideline F,\n\u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be applicable include evidence\nthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (Guideline F, \u00b6\n20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. (Guideline F, \u00b6 20(d).)  \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate his assertion he had satisfied\nthe debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.  Accordingly, those allegations are\nconcluded for Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged financial delinquencies were long-standing and date to\nat least 1991, when he sought protection from his creditors by declaring Chapter 13\nbankruptcy. In 1996, Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed, when he failed\nto meet the terms of his payment plan. At that time, Applicant promised to pay his\nunsecured creditors.  A year after his bankruptcy case was dismissed, Applicant\u2019s credit\nreport showed an increase in indebtedness. \nTo his credit, Applicant provided documentation that corroborated his statements\nthat he had recently paid two medical bills, alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d.  However,\nApplicant\u2019s two largest financial delinquencies, alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., remain.\nAlthough Applicant stated he had payment plans to resolve the debts, he failed to\nprovide documentation to corroborate settlements that he said reduced the amounts of\nthe debts. He also failed to produce receipts from the creditors acknowledging receipt of\npayments. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s delinquent financial behavior remains as a security\nconcern and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I\nconclude that Guideline F, \u00b6 20(a) does not apply as a mitigating condition.\nApplicant was laid off from three jobs. The first lay-off occurred in 2001, and\nApplicant was unemployed for 13 months, until August 2002.  He was unemployed\nagain from March 2003 to June or July 2003. He was unemployed as the result of a lay-\noff by employer C between February and October 2006. Applicant asserted his\nunemployment contributed to his inability to timely pay his creditors. During his\nunemployment between 2001 and early 2004, he used three credit cards to pay his\nliving expenses, thus incurring considerable additional debt. Choosing to pay his living\nexpenses in this way caused Applicant to become financially overextended. Applicant\nwas not persuasive when he argued that his financial delinquencies were largely\nbeyond his control or that he acted reasonably under the circumstances.  Accordingly, I\nconclude \u00b6 20(b) applies only in part to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\n\n8\nNothing in the record suggests Applicant has sought or participated in financial\ncounseling and has a plan in place to avoid financial delinquencies in the future.\nAccordingly, I conclude that \u00b6 20(c) is inapplicable.  \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate that he had satisfied three of\nhis five delinquencies. One debt was satisfied in 2007; the other two were satisfied after\nhe received the SOR. With the exception of the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant\u2019s\nrecent actions to pay his creditors reflected neither a good faith effort to timely pay his\ndebts nor a track record of consistently meeting his financial obligations.  Accordingly, I\nconclude that \u00b6 20(d) is applicable only in part.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \u201cOf\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.\u201d Guideline E, \u00b6 15.   \nUnder Guideline E, a security concern is raised by an individual\u2019s \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d Guideline E, \u00b6 16(a). \nApplicant completed a SF-86 on May 15, 2007. His signed and dated SF-86 is\nentered in the record as Item 7. In his responses to Questions 28a and 28b on the SF-\n86, Applicant denied any financial delinquencies of 180 days in the last seven years,\nand he denied being over 90 days delinquent on any debt. In his answer to the SOR,\nAppellant acknowledged debts that he accrued between 2001 and 2004 and which\nremained unpaid. In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated he was unaware of his\ndelinquent debts until he met with an authorized investigator in January 2005. Yet, when\nhe completed his SF-86 in May 2007, he denied any debts of over 180 days in the past\nseven years and he denied any debts of over 90 days. In his answer to the SOR,\nApplicant denied he falsified his answers to questions 28a and 28b. Given his previous\nacknowledgment of those debts in his January 2005 affidavit and his expressed intent at\nthat time to contact his creditors and pay his debts, Applicant\u2019s denials on his May 15,\n2007 SF-86 were not credible.   \nTwo Guideline E mitigating conditions (MC) might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s\nconduct. Pursuant to MC 17(a),  personal conduct security concerns might be mitigated\nif \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment,\nor falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d Pursuant to MC 17(e), personal\n\n9\nconduct security concerns might be mitigated \u201cif the individual has taken positive steps\nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d\nApplicant provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to list his financial\ndelinquencies on his 2007 SF-86.  At the time he completed his SF-86 in 2007,\nApplicant was approximately 57 years old and had held a security clearance since 1969.\nAlthough he knew, or should have known, the importance of telling the truth to the\nGovernment, he had reason to attempt to minimize his knowledge of his financial\ndelinquencies. His assertions that his falsifications were made because he was ignorant\nof his financial delinquencies were not credible. He did not make good-faith efforts to\ncorrect his omissions, concealment, or falsifications before being confronted with the\nfacts, and he did not take positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress caused by his long-standing financial\ndelinquencies.  I conclude that MC 17(a) and MC 17(e) do not apply to the facts of\nApplicant\u2019s case.\nWhole Person Concept\nThe revised adjudicative guidelines and the Directive require that the adjudicative\nprocess in a security clearance case not only assess conduct under the adjudicative\nguidelines, but it must also reflect a careful weighing of a number of variables known as\nthe whole person concept.  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis\ninclude the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or\nrecurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has a history of financial over-extension. His\nhistory of not meeting his financial obligations and his inability to pay his debts over a\nperiod of several years raises a security concern because it suggests a lack of effort or\nresolve. To his credit, he has satisfied three debts alleged on the SOR. However, he\nsatisfied two of those three debts recently. Two of the three satisfied debts, which were\nincurred or placed for collection over five years ago, were satisfied after he received the\nSOR.\nApplicant listed over $100,000 in assets on his Personal Financial Statement,\nleading to a conclusion that he could have used his own resources to make his creditors\nwhole. He has not sought consumer credit counseling or assistance in learning how to\nmanage his finances. Despite paying three of the debts alleged on the SOR, Applicant\nhas failed to demonstrate that his financial problems will not continue to be security\nconcerns in the future. \n\n10\nApplicant deliberately falsified his SF-86 to hide his financial delinquencies from\nthe government, suggesting that he put his own interests before those of the\ngovernment and was untrustworthy and unreliable.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount\nconcern. Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose\nfurther punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the objective of the security\nclearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts\nand omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct. Having done so, I\nconclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance. In reaching my\ndecision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors\nand guidelines in Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended. I conclude\nthat Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c. through 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\n                     Against Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n_____________________\n                                            \nJOAN CATON ANTHONY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on July 29, 2008, with additional\ndocuments and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was\nassigned to this Administrative Judge on September 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on September 16, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on\nOctober 28, 2008, in Santa Barbara, California.\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 12, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and the documents submitted as part of\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s RSOR were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on November 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.f., under\nGuideline J, 2.a. through 2.d., and 2.f., under Guideline H, and 3.b through 3.d. under\nGuideline E. He denied allegations 2.e. and 3.a. The admitted allegations are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He served in the\nNavy from 2000 to 2005, and received and Honorable Discharge. He is currently\nemployed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in following criminal acts:\n1.a. On July 4, 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with Misdemeanor\nDrunk Driving with Injury Enhancement, Felony DUI with .08% Alcohol Causing bodily\nInjury with Enhancement, and Failure to Provide Proof of Insurance.  He pled no contest\nto the charge of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, a misdemeanor. Applicant was\nsentenced to serve 20 days in jail, which he did serve, perform community service,\nattend a DUI First Offender program, and he was placed on three years probation.\nApplicant testified that he believed he had about five drinks in the course of an\nhour, after which he drove his vehicle and became involved in a vehicular accident. He\nremains on probation for approximately two more years during which he must report to\na probation officer. He received a fine of $3,000, and he still owes $2,000 on this fine. \n1.b. On March 3, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with Disorderly\nConduct. He was sentenced to serve six months in jail; which was suspended, and fined\n$217.\nApplicant and an acquaintance in the Navy had a physical altercation as to who\nwould drive a vehicle. This was after they had both been out for the evening, during\nwhich time they were both consuming alcohol. \n1.c. On July 29, 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with Distribution of a\nLook-A-Like Substance, a class three felony. Applicant was found Guilty, and he was\nsentenced to two years probation, and ordered to pay fines and costs of $813.\n\n3\nApplicant testified that he attempted to sell baking soda to a drug user and\ncharge him as if it were cocaine. The individual whom he believed to be a drug user was\nan undercover police officer, which resulted in Applicant\u2019s arrest. He testified that he\nserved two weeks in jail for this offense. \n1.d. On May 17, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with Unlawful Use of\na Weapon, a felony.  He was found guilty and sentenced to serve 12 months probation,\nand pay fines and costs of $255. On September 16, 1998, his probation was extended\nfor two additional years and he was sentenced to serve 14 days in jail. \nApplicant testified that a friend of his had accidentally shot himself with a gun.\nApplicant claimed that while the friend was in the hospital, Applicant took the gun from\nhis friend\u2019s vehicle in order to keep the police from locating it, but the police had the\nvehicle under surveillance, and Applicant was arrested and charged. As alleged in 3.d.\nbelow, Applicant had a different explanations as to what actually occurred in this event. \n1.e. On March 24, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of\nCannabis (30 grams) and Possession of a Firearm without a Valid license, a\nmisdemeanor.  He was found guilty sentenced to serve 16 days in jail; and he was\ngiven credit for 16 days time served. \nApplicant testified that he was driving when he was stopped by a police officer,\nwho found both marijuana and a shell casing in his vehicle. Applicant claimed that the\namount of marijuana was less that the 30 grams for which he was charged, but he had\nbeen using it. He also testified that in a sworn statement that he provided to a\nGovernment investigator, he claimed that the shell casing was from when he went\nhunting with his uncle, although at the hearing he conceded that the casing was not\nfrom hunting with his uncle.  \n1.f. On January 23, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with Disorderly\nConduct.\nThis incident is the result of a physical altercation between Applicant and another\nindividual at a shopping mall. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists 6 allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under Adjudicative\nGuideline H. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were\nlisted in the SOR:\n2.a. In September 2006, Applicant tested positive for marijuana as a result of a\ndrug test conducted by his employer. This resulted in his being terminated from this\nemployer. Applicant claimed that he tested positive for marijuana because of his one\ntime marijuana usage on July 4, 2006. \n\n4\n2.b. In August 2006, Applicant failed a drug test given by a prospective employer.\nAs a result of the failed drug test, he was not hired by this employer. Applicant also\nclaimed that he failed this drug test because of his one time usage on July 4, 2006. \n2.c.  Applicant used marijuana on at least July 4, 2006, when he was with friends\nat a barbecue.  Applicant contends that was the only time since he left the Navy that he\nused an illegal substance. \n2.d.  In a signed, sworn statement, dated October 23, 2001, Applicant stated that\nhe had no intension of using marijuana in the future (Exhibit 10). Clearly he used it at\nleast one time after stating that he would not use it again. \n2.e.  Applicant used marijuana on a daily basis for a period of time prior to his\nentering the Navy in September 2000. In his RSOR, Applicant denied this allegation.\nHowever, at the hearing, he testified that for approximately three years before he\nentered the Navy, 1997 to 2000, he was using marijuana on a daily basis. \nApplicant testified that he had not been truthful in his RSOR because he was\nashamed that he had ever used marijuana and also to keep himself from looking even\nworse than he already did (Tr at 54-55). \n2.f. On March 24, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of\nCannabis (30 grams), as alleged in 1.e., above. As discussed above, Applicant claimed\nthat the amount of Cannabis in his possession was less than the 30 grams that had\nbeen alleged, but he did concede that he had been using the marijuana that he\npossessed. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n3.a. Applicant executed a signed, sworn statement to a DoD investigator, dated\nOctober 23, 2001, in which he admitted that he deliberately falsified material facts\nbefore he entered the Navy when he claimed that he had only used cannabis on one\noccasion, whereas he had been using it on a daily basis prior to his entering the Navy\n(Exhibit 10). \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he believed that if he had been truthful\nabout his marijuana usage before he entered the Navy, he might not be allowed to enlist\nin the Navy (Tr at 60).\n3.b. During a personal subject interview with a DoD investigator on May 17,\n2007, Applicant stated that he had only used marijuana on two occasions on July 2006\nand February 2000, whereas he had been using it on a daily basis prior to his entering\nthe Navy. \nAt the hearing, Applicant conceded that he lied about his marijuana usage in\n2007, because he had forgotten that on Exhibit 10 made in 2001, he had told the truth\nabout his marijuana usage.  He also admitted that he had lied to help him get a\nclearance.\n\n5\n3.c. In March 28, 2008 Answers to Interrogatories (Exhibit 4), Applicant claimed\nthat he had only used cannabis on one occasion, whereas he had been using it on a\ndaily basis prior to his entering the Navy. \n3.d. Applicant gave two different versions of the circumstances concerning the\ncriminal activity that has been alleged on paragraph 1.d., above, one version on his\nSCA dated April 3, 2007, in which he got the gun out of the car of his friend and a\ndifferent version in a signed, sworn statement made to a DoD investigator on October\n23, 2001, in which he found the gun in an alley. \nMitigation\nIn his RSOR, Applicant submitted a letter of recommendation from his current\nsupervisor, who spoke in very positive terms about Applicant. He also submitted a\nLetter of Commendation from his Commanding Officer and a Citation, both of which he\nreceived while in the Navy.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n6\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information)\nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, as\nhe was arrested and convicted of six different criminal violations that spanned a period\nfrom 1993 to the most recent DUI in 2007. Applicant has two more years remaining on\nthis latest criminal violation as well as $2,000 of his fine that has not yet been paid. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and (d), individual is currently on\nprobation, apply in this case. Under Mitigation Conditions, I find that no MC applies to\nthis Applicant, because of the seriousness and recency of the latest criminal conduct.\nApplicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use of\nmarijuana, after stating that he would not use marijuana in the future is of concern,\nespecially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall\nconduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 25. (a) (any drug abuse), and (c) (illegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).\nIt appears that Applicant has had extremely limited use of any illegal substance\nin the last few years, However, because the evidence shows multiple examples of\nApplicant not being truthful about his previous drug usage, I can not conclude that his\ncurrent statements concerning his drug usage are credible or come within any of the\nMitigating Conditions. \nAccordingly, Paragraph 2 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n\n7\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant has been\nless than candid and truthful with information that he has provided to the Government\nin many forms and as recently as when he denied his previous drug usage on his Reply\nto the SOR.  \nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC (a), deliberate\nomission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, and (b), deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer or investigator, apply.  No Mitigating Condition is\napplicable.\nI resolve Paragraph 3, Guideline E, against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, including the multiple false information provided by Applicant, and\nmultiple examples of criminal conduct, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n\n8\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR with explanation. Applicant is 34 years old and has been a consultant for a defense contractor for over two years. For the two years before working for the defense contractor, she worked as a project administrator for another defense contractor. She received her undergraduate degree from a Nigerian university and a master's degree from a United States university. She is divorced with no children. Applicant admits her mother and father are citizens and residents of Nigeria. Applicant admits one of her sisters is a citizen of Nigeria but a resident of the Netherlands. It is noted that in her e-QIP Applicant stated that this sister is a citizen of the Netherlands. Since Applicant admitted to the SOR allegation that her sister was a citizen of Nigeria and a resident of the Netherlands, I find that the sister is a citizen of Nigeria residing in the Netherlands. Another sister is a citizen of Nigeria but a resident of the United States (Item 3, e-QIP, dated November 2, 2006; Item 2, Response to SOR, dated June 27, 2008). There is no direct information when Applicant came to the United States. She reports that she graduated with an undergraduate degree from a Nigerian university in December 1997. She reports living in the United States commencing in January 1998. I find that she arrived in the",

On May 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for foreign influence under Guideline B and foreign preference under \nGuideline C.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 9, 2008.  She admitted the \nfactual allegations in the SOR but denied that the facts created security concerns.  She \nelected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on August 27, 2008.  \nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on September 12, 2008, \nand was provided the opportunity to file objections, and submit material to refute, \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant did not submit additional \ninformation.  The case was assigned to me on October 24, 2008.  Based on a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel in the FORM asked that administrative notice be taken of \ncertain facts concerning Nigeria (Item 5).  I have considered the request and the \ndocuments provided by Department Counsel.  Administrative notice is taken of the facts \nas noted below in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following \nessential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR with \nexplanation.   \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and has been a consultant for a defense contractor for \nover two years.  For the two years before working for the defense contractor, she \nworked as a project administrator for another defense contractor.  She received her \nundergraduate degree from a Nigerian university and a master's degree from a United \nStates university.  She is divorced with no children.  Applicant admits her mother and \nfather are citizens and residents of Nigeria.  Applicant admits one of her sisters is a \ncitizen of Nigeria but a resident of the Netherlands.  It is noted that in her e-QIP \nApplicant stated that this sister is a citizen of the Netherlands.  Since Applicant admitted \nto the SOR allegation that her sister was a citizen of Nigeria and a resident of the \nNetherlands, I find that the sister is a citizen of Nigeria residing in the Netherlands.  \nAnother sister is a citizen of Nigeria but a resident of the United States (Item 3, e-QIP, \ndated November 2, 2006; Item 2, Response to SOR, dated June 27, 2008).    \n \n \n \nThere is no direct information when Applicant came to the United States.  She \nreports that she graduated with an undergraduate degree from a Nigerian university in \nDecember 1997.  She reports living in the United States commencing in January 1998.  \nI find that she arrived in the United States in January 1998.  Applicant became a United \nStates citizen on March 23, 2004.  Applicant also admits she has dual citizenship with \nNigeria (See Item 3, e-QIP, dated November 2, 2006).   \n \n \nApplicant admits that her mother and sisters \"mean the world to her\" and that she \nkeeps in contact with them.  She feels that she is doing only what a responsible \ndaughter and sister would do.  Her family in Nigeria raised her and gave her the \nopportunity to come to the United States for an education and a career.  She maintains \nher Nigerian citizenship because her mother is still alive and as the oldest daughter she \nhas the responsibility to settle her affairs in the future.  Neither of her parents are \nmembers of political organizations nor do they own property in Nigeria.  Applicant has \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbeen in the United States for over 11 years and has not returned to Nigeria since she \nleft (Case File, Response to SOR, dated June 9, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant admits she still has a Nigerian passport.  The passport was issued to \nher in July 15, 1999, and expired on July 24, 2004.  Applicant admits that she still has \npossession of this Nigerian passport even though it has expired.  She wants to retain \nthe Nigerian passport so she can go to Nigeria to resolve her mother's affairs upon her \ndeath.  She will use the passport to prove she was a Nigerian citizen and to ease the \nadministrative requirements for her to enter Nigeria. She last used it in November 2003 \nwhen she visited her sister in the Netherlands.  She is not willing to destroy or otherwise \nreturn the passport (Item 4, Interrogatories, dated March 10, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant feels she has not indicated a preference for Nigeria over the United \nStates.  She holds the United States in high esteem.  She has gained from being a \nresident and citizen of the United States.  Her ties to Nigeria merely show that she has a \npast.  Applicant points out that she has a good background investigation, her finances \nare in order, and she has no criminal record.  She has a graduate degree and owns her \nown house in the United States.  She is a law abiding citizen that just happens to have \nfamily ties to Nigeria.  Her mother has obtained a United States residency card and \nanticipates relocating to the United States soon (Case file, Response to SOR, dated \nJune 9, 2008).   \n \n \nApplicant takes great pride in working in and being a citizen of the United States.  \nShe learned a lot working with military and civilian personnel.  She sees the great pride \ncitizens have in the United States and what military personnel give up for this country.  \nShe is proud Americans are usually the first to respond to disasters.  She does not \nbelieve her dual citizenship should prevent her from having access to classified \ninformation (Case File, Response to SOR, dated June 9, 2008). \n \n \nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populated country.  Nigeria became independent from \nGreat Britain in 1960, and has a constitutional parliamentary government.  The country \nwas ruled by the military until 1999 when there was a democratic election bringing back \ncivilian rule. (Item 5, FORM Exhibit 1, Background Note: Nigeria, United Stated \nDepartment of State, dated July 2008)  The Department of State continuously issues \ntravel warnings because of chaos and lawlessness in Nigeria.  Lawlessness in Nigeria \nleads to car bombings, kidnapping of foreigners, and violent crimes.  Violence is \nparticularly acute in the Niger Delta region.  Religious tension between Muslims and \nChristians results in occasional acts of communal violence.  Al-Qaida leadership has \nexpressed interest in overthrowing the government.  Road and air travel are dangerous. \n(Item 5, Travel Warning Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007)  An additional warning \nconcerning militant activities was recently issued by the United States Embassy in \nNigeria.  It noted that militant groups are expanding their target areas with possible \ntargets being expatriate personnel, western businesses or facilities, and areas visited by \ntourists and foreigners.  Personnel were advised to increase security and remain vigilant \n(Item 5, Warden Message, dated June 26, 2008). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe government\u2019s human rights record is poor and government officials commit \nserious human rights abuses.  These include the abridgment of rights to change \ngovernment, politically motivated killings by security forces, use of excessive force and \ntorture, restriction on free speech and press, and other physical human rights abuses. \n(Item 5, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Nigeria, dated March 11, \n2008)   \n \n \nNigeria has made progress in a fragile democracy.  Nigeria is one of the United \nStates\u2019 key strategic partners in Africa.  It became a major player in Africa helping to \nnegotiate settlements with other countries and plays a vital role in peacekeeping \noperations.  Nigeria remains relatively stable although ethnic and religious clashes in \npart of the country are common. (Item 5, CRS Report to Congress, Nigeria: Current \nIssues, January 30, 2008) \n \n \nThere have been improved and strong ties between Nigeria and the United State \nsince June 1998.  Bilateral relationships have continued to improve and there is good \ncooperation on many important foreign policy goals.  The Nigerian government has lent \nstrong support to the United States government\u2019s counter-terrorism efforts since \nSeptember 11, 2001.  Nigeria has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism \nconsensus among states in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Item 5, Background Notes on Nigeria, \ndated July 2008, at 11-12)  There is no evidence Nigeria has exploited its citizens to \nobtain classified information from United States citizens. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may indicate \nthe individual has divided loyalties, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests.  Adjudication under this \nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including but not limited to, such consideration as \nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant's parents are citizens and residents of Nigeria.  Her sisters are citizens \nof Nigeria but one resides in the United States and the other in the Netherlands.  There \nis no direct evidence of the extent and frequency of Applicant's contact with her parents \nor sisters but she does state that the family is very close.  Since they are close, there \nmust be contact between them.  The government has established that there is a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion in Nigeria because Nigeria is a country with a poor human rights record and \nmuch lawlessness in the country necessitating a continuous and increased travel \nwarning issued by the United States Government.  There have been kidnappings and \nkillings of foreigners in Nigeria, particularly oil industry workers.  Applicant's parents in \nNigeria raise security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI \nDC) AG \u00b6 79(a) \"Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if \nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\"; and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) \"Connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\".  There \nis no security concern for her sisters who are citizens of Nigeria but live in the United \nStates and the Netherlands.  There is no heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion since they are not located in Nigeria. \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) \"the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.\"; AG \u00b6 8(b) \"there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest\".  I have not considered AG \u00b6 8(c) \"Contact or communication with \nforeign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create \na risk for foreign influence or exploitation\".  There is no evidence presented by Applicant \nthat contact with her parents is casual or infrequent.  This mitigating condition has not \nbeen raised by Applicant.  In fact because of Applicant's concern and feeling for her \nmother, it is assumed that the contact is frequent and not casual. \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where she is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of her family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd., Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, App. Bd. \nJul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR Case No. \n03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to \napply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the United States \ninterest. \n \n \nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s family in Nigeria causes security concerns, I \nconsidered that Nigeria is an ally of the United States, has a defense agreement with \nthe United States, and is one of the United States\u2019 substantial trading partners.  While \nNigeria has had a poor human rights record, I considered that Nigeria is improving its \nhuman rights position and its people enjoy basic freedoms.  There are no indications the \ngovernment of Nigeria or any group of terrorists or lawless entities in Nigeria have \ntargeted United States citizens or relatives of United States citizens to provide economic \nor other sensitive information.  While Nigeria is a country friendly to the United Stares, it \ncould engage in espionage against United States interests.  Friendly countries may \nhave profound disagreements with the United States or have engaged in espionage \n\n \n7 \n \n \nagainst United States economic, scientific, or technical interest.  A friendly relationship \nis not determinative, but it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt \nto exploit a United States citizen through relatives or associates in that country.  Nigeria \nis not a hostile country, nor is its interests inimical to the United States.  The United \nStates and Nigeria are large democracies, enjoy good relations, and are trading \npartners.  It is reasonable to consider that Nigeria would not take any action to \njeopardize their friendly position with the United States because of their need for trade \nand defense assistance from the United States.  It would be considered an act \nunfriendly to the Nigerian interest with the United States to coerce its citizens with \nrelatives in the United States to pressure their United States relatives to provide \neconomic or other espionage information against the interest of the United States.  \nWhile none of the considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all \nfactors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion \nfrom her family members in Nigeria. \n \n \nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a).  \nApplicant states that her parents are not members of any political organization and do \nnot own property in Nigeria.  There is no information presented by Applicant to establish \nwhere her parents live in Nigeria, their occupations, or what benefits are received from \nthe Nigerian government.  She has not established her family members in Nigeria are \nordinary citizens leading normal lives or that her family members\u2019 living conditions, life \nstyle, and professions will likely not place her in a position to choose between the \ninterests of her family and the interests of the United States.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) \"there is no conflict of interest either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, \nor country is minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest\".  Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to duress is important.  \nApplicant has been in the United States for over 11 years and a United States citizen for \nabout four years.  Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States including her house, and \nshe has no financial interest in Nigeria.  Applicant has not returned to Nigeria since she \nleft the country.  However, Applicant has not demonstrated that she is not vulnerable to \nduress.  Applicant has a strong sense of loyalty or obligation to his parents in Nigeria.  \nShe has a connection and relationship to the United States, but she has not established \nthat it is not stronger than the parent/child bond and sense of obligation she has to her \nparents in Nigeria.  She has not demonstrated that her feeling of loyalty to the United \nStates will overcome her strong feelings and relationship with her parents in Nigeria.  FI \nMC \u00b6 8(b) does not apply.  Applicant has not met her heavy burden to mitigate that her \nparents in Nigeria do not cause a security concern.   \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then she may be prone to provide information or make \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States (AG \u00b6 9).  Applicant has \nan expired Nigerian passport in her possession that she refuses to relinquish or destroy.  \nShe will use the passport to facilitate her entry into Nigeria to settle her mother's affairs.  \nShe claims to be a dual citizen of Nigeria and the United States.  These actions raise \nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) \"Exercise of any right, \nprivilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a United States citizen or \nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.\"  This security concern applies even \nthough the passport is not current because Applicant intends to use the passport to \nfacilitate her entry into Nigeria. \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Nigeria because she was born in Nigeria.  Foreign \nPreference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) AG 11(a) \"Dual citizenship is based solely on \nparents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country\" applies.  The United States Supreme \nCourt has recognized a right under the United States Constitution for United States \ncitizens to have a dual citizenship with another country (Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 \n(1967).  Eligibility for a security clearance must be determined by application of the \ndisqualifying conditions for foreign preference to the factual circumstances.  The \nPresident in promulgating the disqualifying conditions could have specified that dual \ncitizenship by itself was a security concern, but he did not.  The rule promulgated is for \na security concern based on an exercise of dual citizenship.  Applicant has exercised \nher dual citizenship.  She maintains a foreign passport for future use to facilitate her \nactions to settle her mother's affairs.  Applicant also raised Foreign Preference \nMitigating Conditions (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(b) \"The individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship\", and FP MC AG \u00b6 11(e) \"The passport has been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\"  \nThese mitigating conditions do not apply.  Even though Applicant's Nigerian citizen is \nbased on her birth in Nigeria, she is not willing to renounce her dual citizenship but \naffirmatively acknowledges that she is a dual citizen of Nigeria.  She retains possession \nof her Nigerian passport even though it has expired, and she affirmatively states she will \nnot relinquish or destroy the passport.  Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for \nforeign preference raised by her exercise of foreign citizenship based on her possession \nof a Nigerian passport. \n \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \n\n \n9 \n \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered that Applicant came to the United States to enhance her education \nand that she has worked with defense contractors in support of the United States.  I \nconsidered that she has never returned to her native Nigeria since leaving and arriving \nin the United States over 11 years ago.  I considered the security situation in Nigeria \ncreated by terrorist groups requiring expanded travel warnings.  Applicant failed to \npresent information that her contacts with her foreign citizen and resident parents do not \ncreate a security concern.  Access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant (as to mother only) \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant was born in Lebanon in the late 1960s. Due to his ancestry, however, he did not acquire Lebanese citizenship by virtue of his birth there. He immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s and became a U.S. citizen in 2005. His wife and sister are both naturalized U.S. citizens. His mother, brother, and father-in-law are residents of Lebanon. Applicant has a savings account in Lebanon worth about $25,000. Lebanon is a \u201cnominal democracy\u201d with a poor human rights record.

This document, at p. 9, identifies Hizballah as \u201cthe\nmost technically capable terrorist group in the world.\u201d  This document states that Hizballah has strong ties with Iran and\nhelps Syrian advance its interests in the region.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 14, 2008,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On September 23, 2008, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge John Grattan Metz, Jr., granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision did not take into account significant contrary record evidence and whether the Judge\nimproperly shifted the burden if persuasion to the Government.  Finding error, we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Lebanon in\nthe late 1960s.  Due to his ancestry, however, he did not acquire Lebanese citizenship by virtue of\nhis birth there.  He immigrated to the U.S. in the mid-1990s and became a U.S. citizen in 2005.  His\nwife and sister are both naturalized U.S. citizens.  His mother, brother, and father-in-law are\nresidents of Lebanon.  Applicant has a savings account in Lebanon worth about $25,000.  \nLebanon is a \u201cnominal democracy\u201d with a poor human rights record.  It has long been subject\nto Syrian influence and it is a \u201cpermissive environment\u201d for terrorist organizations hostile to Israel.1\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\n\n3\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in concluding that Applicant\u2019s bank account\ncontained $25,000 in U.S. currency.  The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s savings account had a\nbalance of approximately $100,000.  Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR\nas he had earlier in his reply to interrogatories propounded by DOHA.  However, in this same reply\nto interrogatories, Applicant stated that he had a bank statement showing 46,375,800 Lebanese\npounds, which he averred is equivalent to 25,000 U.S. dollars.  This appears to be the basis for the\nJudge\u2019s finding.  The Board has examined the record and notes the document in question.  It\ndemonstrates bank account activity, although Applicant\u2019s name is nowhere on it.  The dates of this\nactivity appear to have been the late 1990s.  The final entry, however, is poorly reproduced and\nimpossible to read with accuracy.  It appears to show a final balance somewhat in excess of 46\nmillion pounds.  The date of this final balance is totally illegible.  The Board concludes that the bank\nstatement is old, and does not contradict the greater amount listed in the SOR and in Applicant\u2019s\nresponses.  Department Counsel has demonstrated error on this point.     \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\n\nSee Executive Order 13338, May 11, 2004, declaring a national emergency to address geopolitical challenges\n2\nposed by Syria, including its interference in Lebanon.  See also Item IV, U.S. Department of State Country Reports on\nTerrorism, Chapter 2, April 30, 2007, at 9, concerning, inter alia, assassinations in Lebanon aimed at intimidating those\nwho oppose Syrian interference;  Item V, U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3, April 30,\n2007, at 3, concerning, inter alia, Syrian support for Hizballah and for Palestinian terrorist groups; Item VII, U.S.\nDepartment of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, March 11, 2008, at 5, to the effect that Palestinian\nrefugees in Lebanon were \u201csubject to arrest, detention, and harassment by state security forces and rival Palestinian\nfactions.\u201d      \nDirective \u00b6 E2.7)b): \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\n3\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information[.]\u201d  \n4\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006)\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge stated that the Government had not established \u201cthat there was\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because\nof Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Lebanon.\u201d  Decision at 4.  He appears to have concluded,\ntherefore, that the Government had not presented substantial evidence of Guideline B security\nconcerns.  Department Counsel argues persuasively that the Judge\u2019s conclusion in this regard is\nerror.  The Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant\u2019s mother, brother, and father-in-law\nreside in Lebanon, a country in which terrorists operate, in which Syria exerts considerable influence,\nand which has a problematic human rights record.   Applicant\u2019s circumstances as a whole are\n2\nsufficient to raise security concerns under Guideline B, in that they pose a foreseeable risk that\nApplicant could experience a conflict of interest between his obligations to the U.S. and his\nobligations to his relatives in Lebanon.   See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007)\n3\n(\u201cThe presence of immediate family members in a country which a hostile power like Syria is\nattempting to destabilize, and in which terrorist groups operate with a substantial degree of\nautonomy, poses a real concern in the adjudication of applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\u201d)\nTherefore, the Judge should have evaluated the case in light of Applicant\u2019 burden of persuasion as\nto mitigation.  The Board notes that Applicant chose to have the case decided upon the written\nrecord, with the  result that his credibility could not be evaluated in the context of a hearing.  See\nISCR Case No. 08-00899 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2008).  Applicant did not to reply to the\nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material; nor did he submit a reply brief on appeal.   Therefore, his\ncase for mitigation is limited and consists only of his responses to the SOR and to the DOHA\ninterrogatories, in which he lists his family members in Lebanon, his bank account there, and his\nreasons for leaving Lebanon to live in the U.S.  Examining the record as a whole, the Board is not\nable to conclude that content of these documents is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns in his\ncase, in light of the standard set forth in Egan.  Considering the security concerns, and the paucity\nof record evidence as to mitigation, the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not\nsustainable.  \n\n5\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant answered the SOR 25 March 2008, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 July 2008. The record in this case\nclosed 31 May 2008, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to the FORM.\nSeptember 23, 2008\n\nThe SOR alleges, and Applicant admits, that the account is worth $100,000. However, the government\u2019s\n2\nevidence contains contradictory information about the account. I find most persuasive evidence to be\nApplicant\u2019s calculation of the account balance in Lebanese currency exchanged into U.S. dollars.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 41-year-old electrician\nemployed by a defense contractor since February 2002. He has not previously held a\nclearance. \nApplicant was born in Lebanon in February 1967. However, because he was\nborn to Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, he did not acquire Lebanese citizenship.\nLebanon does not permit Palestinian refugees to assimilate into Lebanese society; the\nU.S. Government recognizes such refugees as \u201cstateless persons\u201d [Official Notice\nDocument (O.N.) XIV]. In August 1996, Applicant obtained a travel document (not\npassport) issued by the Lebanese Government to Palestinian refugees (G.E. 5).\nBetween 1996 and 1999, he used this travel document to travel to the U.S. Embassy in\nSyria, where he obtained visas to travel to the U.S. Consequently, his first two children\nwere born in the U.S. in 1996 and 1998. In 1999, he immigrated to the U.S. as a legal\npermanent resident (LPR), and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in August 2005. His\nwife, also a Palestinian, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2000.\nApplicant\u2019s sister became a naturalized U.S. citizen in March 2004. Using his Lebanese\ntravel document, Applicant returned to Lebanon in June 2003 and August 2004, to visit\nhis sick father. He has not returned to Lebanon since, despite the fact that his father\ndied in March 2008.  His expired Lebanese travel document was shredded by his facility\nsecurity officer (FSO).\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, and father-in-law are Palestinian refugees residing in\nLebanon, although his father-in-law is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. and\nresides some of the year in the U.S.  Both Applicant\u2019s mother and brother have pending\nvisa applications to immigrate to the U.S. Neither has any direct connection to the\nLebanese government, which would nevertheless be impossible as stateless persons.\nApplicant has a savings account in Lebanon worth about $25,000.  As Lebanese law\n2\ncurrently stands, he cannot get the money without traveling to Lebanon. Applicant\nestimates his net worth in the U.S. at $200,000.\nLebanon is a nominal democracy with a less-than-perfect human rights record. It\nhas both a long history of civil war and of foreign influence by Syria. Lebanon is not a\nstate sponsor of terrorism, but is a permissive environment for groups recognized by the\nU.S. as terrorist organizations, considered by Lebanon as \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d against\nIsrael. The U.S. State Department continues to maintain a travel warning for U.S.\ncitizens contemplating travel to Lebanon. As a result of the recent fighting between\nIsrael and Lebanon, Applicant states that his family in Lebanon has basically lost every\nthing. He and his family lost homes; his brother lost his business.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n4\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n4\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n5\n4\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.5\nIn this case, the government\u2019s evidence for disqualification under Guideline B is\nmixed. Considering first the country involved, Lebanon and the U.S. enjoy good foreign\nrelations. It has not been demonstrated that the Lebanese government is actively\nengaged in the collection of U.S. intelligence such that would make Applicant or his\nfamily likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence. The government\u2019s evidence\nexplains the links to terrorism that are on-going in Lebanon and the way that those\nterrorist organizations operate, the increase in terrorism, and the increase in\nmembership in terrorist groups. Several of the groups that are frequently in the news,\nfor example Hizballah and Hamas, operate in Lebanon and practice terrorist acts\nagainst Israelis and against U.S. citizens as well as indiscriminate violence in order to\ndraw attention to themselves and increase their membership and their power. There is\nno indication they use terrorism to gain access to U.S. information.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced insufficient\nevidence that there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in\nLebanon. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have any direct connection to the\nLebanese government. All are pending visas to come to the U.S. While his Lebanese\nsavings account cannot be considered insubstantial, it is a fairly insignificant portion of\nApplicant\u2019s net worth, the overwhelming majority of which is in the U.S. Both he and his\nwife are U.S. citizens, and his children are all native-born U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s\nemotional ties are overwhelmingly in the U.S. Further, except for his mother and\nbrother, any property in Lebanon that might hold any emotional sway over him has been\ndestroyed. Under these circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely Applicant can be\npressured based on his family members in Lebanon or his small financial interest there.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\n   Paragraph 1.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign influence.  Eligibility \nfor a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 6, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \ne-QIP version of a Security Clearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On January 17, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nJuly 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant received the SOR. In a sworn, written statement, \ndated January 24, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government \nwas prepared to proceed on February 5, 2008, and the case was assigned to \nAdministrative Judge Henry Lazzaro on February 6, 2008. It was reassigned to me on \nFebruary 14, 2008, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of Hearing was issued on \nFebruary 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 19, 2008. \n \nDuring the hearing, two Government exhibits and two Applicant exhibits were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on March 28, 2008. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take \nAdministrative Notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to Taiwan, also referred to \nas the Republic of China (hereinafter Taiwan), appearing in a written submission of the \nrequest.  Facts are proper for Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable by \nan authorized source and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the source \ninformation relied upon by the Government was publications of the Department of \nState;1 the Congressional Research Service;2 the Centre for Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Studies;3 the National Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of \nthe National Counterintelligence Executive;4 a press release from the U.S. Department \nof Justice, U.S. Attorney, Western District of New York;5 a press release from the U.S. \n \n1 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Background Note: Taiwan, dated \nOctober 2007. \n \n2 Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy \nChoices, dated October 9, 2006. \n \n3 Interagency OPSEC Support Staff, Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, Intelligence Threat \nHandbook, excerpts, dated June 2004. \n \n4 National Counterintelligence Center, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and \nIndustrial Espionage, dated 2000. \n \n5 U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney, Western District of New York, Press Release: Defendant \nSentenced to 48 months in Trade Secret Theft Case Re: United States v. Jonathan C. Sanders, dated Apr. 18, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nDepartment of Justice, U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of Virginia;6 and records of the \nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.7 \n \nWith regard to the National Counterintelligence Center Report, I note that it is \neight years old, and the cited facts are based upon a \u201cprivate survey\u201d of \u201cnearly a dozen \nselected Fortune 500 companies.\u201d The report does not indicate how the companies \nwere selected, what companies were selected, or how they decided upon their input to \nthe survey. The survey results do not indicate whether the collection of economic \ninformation was accomplished through \u201copen\u201d methods, such as reading a newspaper, \nthat raise no security issues under the relevant criteria, or more covert methods that \nmight raise security concerns. Furthermore, as the selected companies are unidentified, \nit is impossible to assess possible bias or determine if there is an existing anti-Taiwan \neconomic or political agenda. For these reasons, I conclude the factual matters \nasserted by Department Counsel, as demonstrated by the proffered report, should be \ngiven less weight than information from a more authoritative source.  \n \nThe two press releases were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan \nactively pursues collection of U.S. economic and propriety information, and therefore, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with family members in Taiwan raises suspicion of him. Neither \ncase involves Applicant personally or involved espionage through any familial \nrelationship. The Western District of New York press release concerns the sentencing of \na U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft during 1999-2001 to the benefit \nof a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no indication of any government \nsponsorship, approval, or involvement encouraging the Taiwanese company\u2018s attempt \nto acquire sensitive commercial information for competitive advantage.  Likewise, there \nis no evidence that Taiwan\u2019s government was involved in, or sanctioned, the criminal \nactivity. \n \nThe Eastern District of Virginia press release and the court record set forth the \nfacts and sentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for unauthorized \npossession of classified information, making false statements to the government \nconcerning his relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer, and by not \nreporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where he met with the foreign intelligence \nofficer. The criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is of decreased relevance to an \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s security suitability, especially where there is no evidence that \nApplicant, nor any member of his family, was ever involved in any aspect of the case or \never targeted by any Taiwanese intelligence official. \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, I take administrative \nnotice that the events described in the press releases or related court record occurred,8 \n \n6 U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney, Eastern District of Virginia, Press Release: Former State \nDepartment Official Sentenced for Mishandling Classified Material, dated Jan. 22, 2007. \n \n7 U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Criminal Case No. 1:05CR43, U.S. v.

Keyser, \nStatement of Facts, dated Dec. 12, 2005. \n \n8 Tr. at 28-30. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nas well as that information set forth in the National Counterintelligence Center Report.  \nHowever, the inference that somehow Applicant and/or his family participated in criminal \nactivity was not argued and is not accepted.  Pursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of \nEvidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below under the \nTaiwan subsection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.f. of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  He has been \nemployed as a senior electrical engineer by the same government contractor since \nAugust 2005.9 Applicant\u2019s colleagues, working group leaders, both current and past, \nand a director of operations, all support his application and characterize him in a very \npositive light, using terms such as: integrity, sound judgment, highest ethical standards, \ndiligent, and knowledgeable.10 According to his immediate supervisor, his judgment and \nreliability are both rated \u201cexcellent,\u201d the highest of the five possible ratings on his \nemployee performance evaluation.11 \n \nApplicant was born in Taiwan in 1972,12 and resided there with one or both of his \nparents.  When his parents divorced, he moved in with his father.13  In 1982, at the age \nof 10, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. with his father, stepmother, and brother.14 He \nsubsequently left his father\u2019s residence when he was in high school. He attended a U.S. \nuniversity from 1990 until 1996, and earned BSEE and MS degrees in engineering \nmanagement.15 Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1991.16 In \n1994, Applicant married,17 and he and his wife have had three children, all of whom are \nnative-born Americans.18  \n \n \n9 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated Feb. 6, 2006), at 11. \n \n10 See Applicant Exhibits B-1 through B-5 (Character References, various dates). \n \n11 Applicant Exhibit A (Employee Performance Evaluation, dated Oct. 18, 2007), at 3. \n \n12 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 9, at 1. \n \n13 Tr. at 44. \n \n14 Id. at 45. \n \n15 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 9, at 10. \n \n16 Id. at 7. \n \n17 Id. at 17. \n \n18 Id. at 21-23. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in 1947 and raised in Taiwan.19 When Applicant and \nhis father relocated to the U.S., the father owned and operated a restaurant.20 \nApplicant\u2019s father has no known affiliations with the Taiwanese Government.21 After he \nleft his father\u2019s residence, Applicant and his father were estranged, and did not \ncommunicate for about 20 years.22 The first and only time they have spoken since the \nmid-1980s was in March 2007, after his father had a stroke and his uncle encouraged \nhim to call his father.23 As it happens, his father was in a hospital located in the Peoples \nRepublic of China (PRC).24 Their conversation lasted less than five minutes because \nhis father had a hard time speaking.25 Applicant has no idea where his father is now.26  \nApplicant has not had any communication with his father since that one brief telephone \ncall. \n \nHis mother was born in 1947 and raised in Taiwan, and has remained a resident \nand citizen of Taiwan.27 Since her divorce, she has been a single homemaker, and for \nthe past 10 years, has not held a job.28 In May 2006, Applicant saw his mother for the \nsecond time since he left Taiwan (1995 was the first time). He speaks with her by \ntelephone or computer, generally once a month.29 While she has an inheritance, on \noccasion, depending on his financial condition, Applicant may send her small amounts \nof money.30 He did not send her any money in 2007, but did bring her $7,000-$8,000 \nwhen they visited in 2006.31 His mother has never had any type of job or affiliation with \nthe Government of Taiwan.32 \n \n \n19 Id. at 21. \n \n20 Tr. at 45. \n \n21 Id. at 65. \n \n22 Id. at 44. \n \n23 Id. at 44-46. \n \n24 Id.  \n \n25 Id. at 55-56. \n \n26 Id. at 46. \n \n27 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 9, at 20. \n \n28 Tr. at 43. \n \n29 Id. at 54. \n \n30 Id. at 53. \n \n31 Id. at 53-54. \n \n32 Id. at 54. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nree \nchildren.  \nt furnish \nher support, but does send some money generally on the Chinese New Year.47 \nTaiwan, and continue to reside there as Taiwanese citizens.48 Her brother is a laborer, \n              \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Taiwan in 1970.33 It is unclear where she was raised \nor when she immigrated to the U.S.  They were married in the U.S.34 She became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in September 1999.35 While she retains her dual citizenship, \nshe is willing to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship, but has not been furnished \nguidance on how to do so.36 Likewise, she is willing to surrender her Taiwanese \npassport, which expires in 2016.37 She does not hold a job outside the family home, but \nis a fulltime homemaker raising their three children.38 In 1995, after their marriage in the \nU.S., Applicant and his wife returned to Taiwan so their families could bless them and \nhave a traditional wedding dinner.39 They returned briefly in 2006 with their th\n40\n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born and raised in Taiwan where she continues to \nreside as a Taiwanese citizen.41 She owns a restaurant in Taiwan.42  She has never \nbeen affiliated with the Taiwanese Government or Intelligence Service.43 She came to \nthe U.S. on one occasion in the 1990s,44 and Applicant and his wife have visited Taiwan \nto see her in 1995 and 2006.45  Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her at least once a month, \nbut Applicant\u2019s contacts are about once every six months.46 Applicant does no\n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has two sisters and one brother who were born and raised in \n                                            \n33 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 9, at 17. \n Id. \n Id. at 18. \n Tr. at 52. \n Id. at 41-42. \n Id. at 52. \n Government Exhibit 2 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated Dec. 17, 2007), at 26. \n Id. \n Tr. at 47. \n Id. at 46, 48, 56. \n Id. at 56. \n Id. at 47. \n Government Exhibit 2, supra note 39, at 26. \n Tr. at 56-57. \n47 Id. at 64. \n \n \n34\n \n35\n \n36\n \n37\n \n38\n \n39\n \n40\n \n41\n \n42\n \n43\n \n44\n \n45\n \n46\n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \none sister is a flight attendant, and the other sister is a homemaker.49 Applicant last saw \nthem in 2006, and he has little, if any, contact with his in-laws, but his wife does have \nperiodic contacts with her sisters.50 They do not speak to the brother.51 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father has four brothers-Applicant\u2019s uncles-whom he has not seen nor \nhad any contact with, since he immigrated to the U.S. in 1982.52 They were all born and \nraised in Taiwan.

The U.S. does not support independence for Taiwan and, under the Taiwan \nRelations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979, is committed to a \u201cone-China policy.\u201d \nNevertheless, the U.S. has been also been committed to maintaining cultural, \ncommercial and other nonofficial relations with Tai\n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy with a strong economy, with significant \neconomic contacts with both the PRC and the U.S.  Taiwan\u2019s own national security \nremains under constant threat from the PRC since PRC has not renounced the use of \nforce against Taiwan, and this has led to Taiwan\u2019s large military establishment. \nTaiwan\u2019s armed forces are equipped with weapons obtained primarily from the U.S., but \nTaiwan has stressed military self-r\n \nTaiwan is believed to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and \nproprietary information.

Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation\n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on \n \ny\nG\nThe s\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to\n \n61 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.62 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Also, AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may raise \nsecurity concerns as well. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply in this case.  However, \nthe security significance of these identified conditions requires further examination of \nApplicant\u2019s respective relationships with his various extended family members who are \neither Taiwanese citizen-residents or dual citizen-U.S. residents to determine the \ndegree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG \u00b6 8(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.@ Similarly, AG \u00b6 8(b) may \napply where the evidence shows Athere is no conflict of interest, either because the \nindividual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.@ Also, AG \u00b6 8(c) may apply where \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his various extended family members is diverse. \nThose who are Taiwanese citizen-residents, his mother, father, mother-in-law, brother-\nin-law, two sisters-in-law, and two uncles, require the most scrutiny.  His relationship \nwith his father was strained and, for the most part, non-existent for over 20 years. The \nfive-minute telephone call between them while his father was in the hospital with a \nstroke did not drastically alter this minimal relationship.  Likewise, he has had no \n \n62 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrelationship with his two uncles since he departed Taiwan in 1982. He has no \nrelationship with his brother-in-law, and a rare, indirect relationship with his two sisters-\nin-law. As far as they are concerned, the contacts and relationships are casual and \ninfrequent.  \n \nThe relationship he has with his mother is now somewhat closer and more \nfrequent.  He resided with his father upon his parents\u2019 divorce, as well as after he \narrived in the U.S., and did not see his mother for 13 years after he arrived in the U.S.  It \nwas another 11 years before he saw her again.  While they do have periodic contact by \ntelephone and computer, and he sends her some money every so often, even those \nactivities have not demonstrated a really warm close relationship. His relationship with \nhis mother-in-law is somewhat similar.  He has seen her on only three occasions in 13 \nyears, and has direct contact with her about once every six months. \n \nHis relationship with his spouse, a dual citizen-U.S. resident, is obviously much \ncloser.  Nevertheless, while she retains her dual citizenship, she is willing to renounce \nher Taiwanese citizenship. She does not hold a job outside the family home, but is a \nfulltime homemaker raising their three children. \n \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant \nfactors, including the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the \nrealistic potential for exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the \nforeign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the \ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is \nlimited to countries that are hostile to the United States.63  In fact, the Appeal Board has \ncautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 nations \nand \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d64 Nevertheless, the \nrelationship between a foreign government and the U.S. may be relevant in determining \nwhether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely to attempt to exploit a \nresident or citizen to take action against the U.S. through the Applicant.  It is reasonable \nto presume that a friendly relationship, or the existence of a democratic government, is \nnot determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt \nto exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in that foreign country. \n \nAs noted above, the U.S. and Taiwan have a history of friendly relations making \nit less likely that the Taiwanese Government would attempt coercive means to obtain \nsensitive information.  However, it does not eliminate the possibility that a foreign power \nwould employ some non-coercive measures in an attempt to exploit his relatives.  While \nApplicant has some extended family members still residing in Taiwan, there may be \nspeculation as to \u201csome risk,\u201d but that speculation, in the abstract, does not, without \n \n63 See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. \n10, 2002). \n64 ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nsubstantially more, establish evidence of a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s very causal relationship with his father, brother-in-law, two \nsisters-in-law, and two uncles, there is a very low potential of forcing him to choose \nbetween the interests of U.S. and those of either Taiwan or those extended family \nmembers. He has met his burden of showing there is little likelihood that those \nrelationships could create a risk for foreign influence of exploitation. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) \nand 8(c) fully apply in this case.  As to his slightly closer relationship with his mother and \nmother-in-law, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply to a more limited extent. \n \nAs to his relationship with his wife, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) fully apply.  Applicant has \nbeen a resident of the U.S. since 1982, when he was 10 years old.  He attended U.S. \nschools for his education.  He and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens and their \nthree children are native-born U.S. citizens.  He surrendered his Taiwanese passport \nand they are willing to renounce their dual citizenship. They have no foreign financial \ninterests.  Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation and letters of support laud his hard work \nand excellent performance, and refer to him using terms such as: integrity, sound \njudgment, highest ethical standards, diligent, and knowledgeable. Applicant and his wife \nhave \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that [they] can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has an estimated net \nworth in the U.S. of about $400,000, and does not own any property in Taiwan. He has \nresided in the U.S. since 1982, and became a U.S. citizen in 1991.  He married in the \nU.S., and his closest family members are his wife and three children, and they reside \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nwith him in the U.S.  As such, they are not vulnerable to direct coercion or exploitation, \nand the realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress with regard to \nthem is low. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his various extended family members who are \nTaiwanese citizen-residents is varied. Some are historically non-existent relationships, \nsome are limited to extremely rare visits with periodic telephone contacts, and some are \ngenerally limited to infrequent telephone contacts.  While Taiwan is believed to be an \nactive collector of U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no \nevidence that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain access to such information.  It is \nin Taiwan\u2019s interests to maintain that friendship to counterbalance the PRC.  It is very \nunlikely Taiwan would forcefully attempt to coerce Applicant through his relatives still \nresiding in Taiwan. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) The presence of extended-family members in \nTaiwan without any affiliation or relationship to the Government of Taiwan, does not \ngenerate a realistic potential for exploitation. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 6, 2007.\nOn February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 26, 2008, and elected to\nhave his decision on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on April 28, 2008. Applicant received a complete file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on May 16, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to file\nJuly 28, 2008\n\nDepartment Counsel submitted five items in support of her contentions.\n1\nItem 3 (Answer, signed March 31, 2008).\n2\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application, dated June 6, 2007).\n3\nId.\n4\nItem 5 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated January 7, 2008).\n5\nId.\n6\n2\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.1\nApplicant submitted additional information. The case was assigned to me on July 21,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, received March 31, 2008, Applicant admitted all the\nfactual allegations in the SOR.  He provided additional information to support his\n2\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since April 1998.  He received promotions annually. He is currently\n3\nsingle but planning to marry soon. \nApplicant admitted in his June 2007 security clearance application to using,\npurchasing and selling marijuana, at times daily, from approximately March 1996 until at\nleast July 2006. He also used psilocybin and/or psilocin (hallucinogenic mushrooms)\nonce in 2000.4\nApplicant began using marijuana in high school in March of 1996. He used\nmarijuana with friends and with his parents as frequently as on a daily basis. He felt a\nmild euphoria and calmness after the use. His use progressed to about two to three\ntimes a week in high school. He frequently skipped school to smoke and dropped out of\nschool. His marijuana use continued through July 2006. At that point he decided to stop\nusing illegal substances because \u201cthey were not consistent with his goals for his\npersonal/professional life. However, he used marijuana again with his father at a\nbirthday celebration in June 2007. During the period of his marijuana use, he engaged\nin both the purchase of marijuana to support his habit and the sale of marijuana to\nfriends.  Applicant bought approximately $200 of marijuana per month from 1996 until\n5\n2006.6\nApplicant\u2019s parents and younger brother still use marijuana frequently. He claims\nthat they do not offer it to him any longer. He has not participated in any drug evaluation\n\nId.\n7\n3\nprogram. He believes that he was addicted to marijuana. He acknowledged pressure\nfrom his family to continue to smoke marijuana. \nApplicant does not believe his use of illegal drugs should be excused. He\nbelieves he made a few bad decisions. He explained he grew up in an environment\nwhere the use of marijuana was considered the norm. He has not been in contact with\nmarijuana since 2007. He vows he will not associate with any illegal substances again.\nHe is buying a home with his fiancee and her five-year-old son. They are also expecting\ntheir first child together.  He does not believe that he poses a threat to national security.\n7\nHe would agree to random drug tests over the next 12 months.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n4\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Applicant admitted using\nmarijuana from 1996 to May 2007. He used hallucinogenic mushrooms in 2000. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition.\nUnder AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is\nalso potentially disqualifying. For ten years Applicant purchased marijuana and\npossessed drug paraphernalia. He admitted that he did so on many occasions. This\ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26 (a), the disqualifying conditions\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nillegal use occurred numerous times and as recent as 2007 (after completing his\nsecurity clearance application). I do not find that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26 (b), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Aa\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation\n\n5\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. As noted\nabove, Applicant provided no additional information in response to the FORM other than\nhis comment that he had \u201cnothing to add.\u201d Also, he has not had a sufficient period of\nabstinence for mitigation. In addition, his comments regarding his family do not convince\nme of his future intentions  to refrain from use of illegal drugs in light of his use of drugs\nas recent as 2007 with his father. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been employed for\nmany years with his current employer. He has no documented problems at work and\nhas received promotions. He is now engaged and will start a family. He wants to provide\na secure environment for his family. \nApplicant has used, sold and purchased marijuana for more than ten years. He\npromised to stop in 2006 but instead smoked with his father in May 2007. He\nacknowledged that he made bad decisions. He does not excuse his behavior. His drug\nuse is recent. He is a mature adult. Applicant does not convince me that his poor\njudgment is not likely to recur. Applicant has not met his burden of proof in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph\u2019s 1.a-1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, notarized on February 28, 2008, Applicant admitted to all the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 43-year-old program manager and safety engineer employed with a Department of Defense contractor. He has worked for the same employer since 1999. He has a bachelor of science degree in safety engineering. He has served in the National Guard since 1991, currently serving in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He has held a security clearance since 1989 without incident. He is married and has no children. (Tr at 157, 159-161, 167; Gov 1.) Applicant comes from a family with a long history of military service to the U.S. His father retired at the rank of Colonel after 28 years of active duty military service. During his formative years, Applicant\u2019s family moved to different locations based on where his father was stationed. Applicant\u2019s immediate family, his parents and sister, are citizens of and reside in the U.S. (Tr at 155; Gov 1; AE I.) In 2004, Applicant deployed to Iraq for a six month period. He was also activated during Hurricane Katrina. He currently is assigned to state headquarters. Upon learning that his former squadron is going to be involuntarily activated to deploy to Iraq in June 2009, he volunteered to go with them. (Tr at 148, 161-162, 189.) In October 2004, shortly after his return from his deployment to Iraq, Applicant was invited to go to the airport with a close friend and his family to welcome a Russian exchange student. His f",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Dan Cron, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on June 29, 2007. On January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 28, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nMarch 21, 2008. The case was assigned to me on March 26, 2008. On March 27, 2008, \na Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 14, 2008. On April 1, \n2008, Applicant requested a delay of the hearing because of his heavy workload and his \nintention to retain counsel. Department Counsel had no objection. On April 2, 2008, the \nhearing was cancelled. On June 4, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the \nJuly 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing for June 26, 2008. The hearing was held on that date. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1-3, which were admitted without objection. The \nGovernment requested that administrative notice be taken of one document with 8 \nattachments. The document was marked as Administrative Notice Document I (Admin \nNot I) without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel called eight witnesses, including Applicant,   \nand submitted 7 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - G without \nobjection.  The record was held open until July 17, 2008 for Applicant to submit \nadditional documents. He timely submitted three documents which were admitted as AE \nH, I, and J. Department Counsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions is \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit 1. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on July 15, 2008. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nAdministrative Notice  \n \nThe Russian Federation is composed of 21 republics. (Admin Not I, Doc 1 at 1.) \nThe Government consists of a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral \nlegislature and a weak judiciary. It is a vast and diverse country with a population of 142 \nmillion people. It achieved independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on \nAugust 24, 1991. It is a nuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, \nsocially, and economically. (Admin Not I; Doc 2 at 1-2; Doc 3 at 2-3; Doc 4 at 1.) \n \nThe threat of terrorism in Russia continues to be significant. Travel in the vicinity \nof Chechnya may be dangerous, despite Russian efforts to suppress the terrorists. Acts \nof terrorism include taking hostages and bombings. (Admin Not I, Doc 4 at 4-5; Doc 8 at \n17.)  \n \nRussia has recognized the legitimacy of international human rights standards, \nbut human rights abuses continue. Both Russian federal forces and Chechen rebel \nforces \nact \nwith \nimpunity \nwhile \nengaging \nin \ntorture, \nsummary \nexecutions, \ndisappearances, and arbitrary detentions. Additional problems include corruption, media \nsuppression, life-threatening prison conditions, and corruption in law enforcement. \n(Admin Not I, Doc 2 at 1-3, 5-6,10-11, 5; Doc 3 at 7; Doc 4 at 4-5; Doc 8 at 17-18.)  \n \nThe Russian Federation\u2019s intelligence capability is significant and focuses on \ncollection of information from the United States. As of 2005, Russia and China were the \ntwo most aggressive collectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and \naccounted for the majority of such targeting. Russia also provides technologies which \ncould be used in the construction of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other \ncountries. It is a leading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and \nmilitary-related technology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela. (Admin Not I, Doc 6 at \n6-17.) \n \nU.S. citizens who have at one time held Russian citizenship may be required to \nrenounce Russian citizenship before applying for a Russian visa in their U.S. passport. \nUnless a Russian citizen has formally renounced his or her Russian citizenship, he or \n\n \n3 \n \n \nshe risks being considered a Russian citizen and not allowed to depart except on a \nRussian passport. (Admin Not I, Doc 4 at 4.)   \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, notarized on February 28, 2008, Applicant admitted to \nall the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old program manager and safety engineer employed with \na Department of Defense contractor. He has worked for the same employer since 1999.  \nHe has a bachelor of science degree in safety engineering. He has served in the \nNational Guard since 1991, currently serving in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He has \nheld a security clearance since 1989 without incident.  He is married and has no \nchildren. (Tr at 157, 159-161, 167; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant comes from a family with a long history of military service to the U.S. \nHis father retired at the rank of Colonel after 28 years of active duty military service. \nDuring his formative years, Applicant\u2019s family moved to different locations based on \nwhere his father was stationed. Applicant\u2019s immediate family, his parents and sister, are \ncitizens of and reside in the U.S. (Tr at 155; Gov 1; AE I.) In 2004, Applicant deployed to \nIraq for a six month period. He was also activated during Hurricane Katrina. He currently \nis assigned to state headquarters. Upon learning that his former squadron is going to be \ninvoluntarily activated to deploy to Iraq in June 2009, he volunteered to go with them. \n(Tr at 148, 161-162, 189.)    \n \nIn October 2004, shortly after his return from his deployment to Iraq, Applicant \nwas invited to go to the airport with a close friend and his family to welcome a Russian \nexchange student. His friend and his wife served as her host family. They initially met \nthe exchange student during a visit to Russia as part of their duties in an international \nservice organization. The exchange student was an officer in the service organization \nchapter located on her college campus. Applicant\u2019s friend and his wife invited her to \ncome to the U.S. as an exchange student. (Tr at 26-27, 37-38, 114-117, 164.) \n \nAbout a month after the Russian exchange student arrived, Applicant\u2019s friend \ntelephoned him. His friend explained that the exchange student had been involved in \nminor car accident and asked if Applicant could go to his house and help the exchange \nstudent with insurance and making arrangements to fix the automobile because he and \nhis wife were out of town. Applicant spent the weekend helping the exchange student \nwith the car repairs and insurance. They bonded and Applicant started to date the \nRussian exchange student. They began spending a lot of time together and she moved \ninto Applicant\u2019s house in February 2005. (Tr at 39-40, 164-165.)  \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend (the exchange student) moved back to Russia \nto complete her college studies. Applicant spent a lot of time calling and e-mailing her \nand realized that he missed her. In late July 2005, he went to Russia to visit her. He \nstayed for about three weeks. Applicant does not speak Russian. His girlfriend acted as \n\n \n4 \n \n \nan interpreter where they traveled.  When Applicant returned from this visit, he \nresearched options how his girlfriend could complete her degree at a local university. \nHe sponsored her move back to the U.S.  She arrived in December 2005 and started \nclasses at a local university in January 2006. When she returned, she moved in with \nApplicant. In October 2007, Applicant proposed. They married in April 2007. Applicant\u2019s \nwife is a U.S. permanent resident. (Tr at 41-43, 48, 165-167, 173, 187; AE A; Gov 2.)   \n \nApplicant notified security officers at his full-time employer and at his guard unit \nwhen he began to date Applicant. He also informed them when she moved in with him; \nbefore he traveled to Russian to visit her; and when he got engaged to her. (Tr at 168; \nAE A.) Applicant would never sacrifice the security of his country.  If a situation arose, \nhe would report it to his security officer. (Tr at 178.) All of Applicant\u2019s assets are located \nin the U.S. (Tr at 174; Gov 2; AE D.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens of and reside in Russia. Specifically, they \nreside in a region known as Bashkortostan, located near the Ural mountains. The town \nof Melusz, where her parents reside and where she grew up, is the equivalent of a \ncounty seat with a population of approximately 60,000. It is mostly a farming community \nbut has some industries, specifically, chemical, construction, brick fabrication, and food \nprocessing plants. Her father is the chief engineer for the agriculture department in \nMeleuz county.  He assists area farmers in establishing business relationships relating \nto obtaining oil and fuel for their machinery, finding new farming techniques, and serves \nas a resource for finding vendors who repair farm machinery. He will retire in March \n2009. (Tr at 25-36; Gov 2.) Applicant\u2019s mother is retired. She previously owned two \nbook stores. Applicant\u2019s wife describes neither parent as being politically active in \nRussian Federation politics. Her father is not a member of the communist party. Her \nmother was a member of the communist party when she was younger. Neither speaks \nEnglish.  (Tr at 44, 60.) Applicant\u2019s wife also has a sister who currently resides in \nMoscow. She used to be a police investigator in a town near where they grew up. She \nnow works as an executive assistant for a Chinese automobile dealership. (Tr at 43, 63; \nGov 2.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws attended their wedding in the U.S. His wife\u2019s sister was in the \nU.S. completing an internship and attended the wedding as well. (Tr at 43-44.) Applicant \nhas minimal contact with them because of the language barrier. His sister-in-law speaks \nEnglish so he has occasional contact with her.  Applicant\u2019s wife sent $1,000 in July \n2007 to her sister when she moved to Moscow. She also sent her $750 in September \n2007. She sends about $500 to her parents at Christmas time. She calls her parents a \ncouple of times a week and communicates with her mother via e-mail about once a \nweek. She contacts her sister about once a week. (Tr at 46; 57-58.) In May 2008, \nApplicant\u2019s wife traveled to Russia to visit her family. Applicant did not go with her \nbecause of the security clearance issue. (Tr at 62-63, 198.) Applicant anticipates they \nwill travel to Russia to visit his wife\u2019s parents in the future out of familial obligation. (Tr at \n199.)    \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA professor emeritus of Russian Language and Culture at a local university \ntestified that Bashkortostan is a remote place in Russia. It is a mixed industrial and \nagricultural area. It operates under the constitution of its own republic with assistance \nfrom Moscow. (Tr at 70- 76, 87.)  \n \nThe Facility Security Officer (FSO) at Applicant\u2019s company testified that she has \nworked with Applicant for nine years. He has held a SECRET clearance for the past \nnine years with no security violations.  Applicant self-reported when he began dating his \ngirlfriend (now wife). He self-reported when his girlfriend moved in with him. He self-\nreported when he traveled to Russia to visit his girlfriend. He self-reported when he \nsponsored his girlfriend to come to the U.S. to attend school. He self-reported his intent \nto marry his girlfriend.  The FSO has never observed signs which would indicate \nApplicant is a security risk. (Tr at 100-112; AE A.)  The Vice President of Human \nResources has known Applicant since he joined the company in 1999. Applicant has \nprogressed in his career working his way up to program manager. Applicant is \nresponsible and honest.  She currently interacts with Applicant about once or twice a \nweek. She does not believe Applicant is a security risk. (Tr at 124-133.)  \n \nThe Chief of the Joint Staff, Joint Headquarters of the state National Guard, a \nBrigadier General, has known Applicant for a number of years. He has been his direct \nsupervisor for the past six years. Applicant is a great asset to Headquarters staff, \nearning the respect of senior leadership in both the Army National Guard and the Air \nNational Guard.  Applicant is consistently a top performer on his staff. He supports his \nrequest to have a security clearance. (AE E.) The Director of Staff, Air National Guard, a \nColonel, has known Applicant since 1998. He has worked with him closely since \nJanuary 2004. He indicates that Applicant has volunteered to serve overseas in harms \nway on numerous occasions. Applicant recently volunteered to deploy to Iraq with his \nformer squadron next summer even though he is no longer assigned to the unit. As a \ncommander, the Director of Staff, has had to assess security risks of the personnel he \nsupervises. He trusts Applicant implicitly and would not hesitate to assign him to duties \nrelated to national security. (Tr at 144-153.)   \n \nA Master Sergeant assigned to the same unit as Applicant also attests to \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness and responsible handling of classified information. (Tr at \n134-143.) Applicant\u2019s friend who introduced Applicant to his future wife testified. He is \nalso Applicant\u2019s financial advisor. Applicant\u2019s wife currently works as the office manager \nfor his company. (Tr at 113-122.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance reports from his civilian employer indicates that he \nexceeds expectations. (AE F.)  His officer performance reports covering the periods \nfrom August 1999 to November 2007 have been outstanding. (AE G.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n6 \n \n \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) apply to Applicant\u2019s case \nbecause his wife is a Russian citizen and her parents and sister are Russian citizens \nresiding in Russia. Specifically, FI DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion); FI DC \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing that information); and FI \nDC \u00b6 7(c) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion) apply.  Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s ties to Russia and the possible effect \nthey may have on Applicant\u2019s conduct are relevant considerations under this guideline. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov, 21, 2002)) There is a rebuttable \npresumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family \nmembers of the person\u2019s spouse. (ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, \n2002)) \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Foreign Influence. I find the following Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition \n(FI MC) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  While Applicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens of and reside in Russia, \nhis deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. support the premise \nthat Applicant will resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests. Applicant \nwas born and raised in the U.S. He grew up in a military family. He has possessed a \nsecurity clearance and worked in the defense industry for over 19 years without a \nsecurity incident.  He has honorably served as an officer in the Air National Guard since \n1991. In 2004, he deployed to Iraq for six months and recently volunteered to deploy to \nIraq again next summer. His superiors, co-workers, and friends all attest to his \n\n \n8 \n \n \ntrustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S. indicate Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nU.S. interests. FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.  \n    \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised under foreign influence.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to his in-laws in Russia, a country that has interests that are \noccasionally adverse to the U.S. and is known to conduct espionage activities against \nthe U.S. I also considered that Applicant is a highly regarded employee with a defense \ncontractor. I considered the favorable recommendations of Applicant\u2019s superior officers \nin the National Guard, his 17 years of service in the National Guard, including his \ndeployments, and his outstanding officer performance reports. Aside from his in-laws, \nApplicant\u2019s family members are U.S citizens residing in the U.S. All of his assets are \nlocated in the U.S. Applicant has held a security clearance for over 19 years with no \nsecurity violations. His superiors, peers and co-workers comment favorably about his \nintegrity, character, and work ethic. While Applicant\u2019s in-laws living in Russia raise a \npotential security threat, Applicant\u2019s significant ties to the U.S. mitigate the security \nthreat.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response, Applicant answered the SOR allegations by admitting\nall four allegations raised and submitting one document. The case was ultimately\nassigned to me on May 2, 2008. Department Counsel and Applicant agreed to a May\n28, 2008, hearing date and a Notice of Hearing was issued on May 13, 2008.\nJuly 8, 2008\n\n Ex. 1 (Administrative Notice) and Ex. 7 (Annual Report to Congress, 2000).\n1\n Applicant\u2019s husband is an immigrant from ROC. Like the rest of his own family, however, he is a naturalized\n2\nU.S. citizen. Tr. 52-53.\n The ROC passport issued in 2002 was marked as valid through 2012, ten years. Consequently, it may be\n3\nassumed the prior ROC passport was obtained in 1992, before Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\n Ex. B (Citizenship Renunciation documents and translations, dated April-May, 2008).\n4\n Ex. C (Cancelled passport, photographic image).\n5\n2\nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted 10 exhibits\n(Ex.). which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-10 without objection. Applicant\nsubmitted three exhibits, accepted as Exs. A-C without objection. No witnesses were\ncalled. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 5, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is granted.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government requested administrative notice of certain facts regarding\nTaiwan, including that country\u2019s precarious position in relation to the People\u2019s Republic\nof China and the U.S. Government\u2019s \u201cone-China\u201d policy. Citing to an eight year old\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage\nfrom the National Counterintelligence Center, it notes that Taiwan is an active collector\nof U.S. economic intelligence.  It points to a 2006 conviction of an individual found guilty\n1\nof aiding Taiwan in information gathering. It also references several documents\naccepted into the record as Exs. 4-8. The Government\u2019s request is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old program analyst who works for a defense contractor.\nShe was born in Taiwan, but immigrated to the United States (U.S.) with her family\nwhen she was an 18-year-old. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996, three\nyears before completing a bachelor\u2019s degree. Applicant is married and has no children.2\nAt the time of her application for a security clearance in 2007, Applicant\npossessed both a U.S. passport, issued in May 2002, and a passport issued by the\nRepublic of China (ROC), issued in July 2002.  She considered herself to be a dual\n3\nnational of the U.S. and Taiwan. In early 2008, Applicant submitted her ROC passport\nfor cancellation and applied for renunciation of her ROC/Taiwanese citizenship. On\nApril 14, 2008, her renunciation of foreign citizenship was completed and a Certificate\nof Citizenship Renunciation was issued.  Her ROC passport, valid through 2012, was\n4\nreturned to her by the appropriate authorities and has been cancelled.  Applicant\u2019s\n5\nexercise of dual citizenship and possession of an active Taiwanese passport were\n\n SOR allegations 1.a (dual citizenship issue) and 1.b. (possession of valid foreign passport issue).\n6\n SOR allegations 1.c (2006 trip) and 1.d (2007 trip).\n7\n Tr. 15.\n8\n Tr. 48.\n9\n Applicant was unclear as to precise work her procedures entailed. Compare Tr. 13 and Tr. 29; 48.\n10\n Tr. 48.\n11\n Tr. 49.\n12\n Id.\n13\n Tr. 61.\n14\n Tr. 14.\n15\n3\nsubject to the first two of four allegations contained in the SOR.  These two issues are\n6\nmoot in light of Applicant\u2019s recent efforts and her supporting documents. \nRemaining at issue are two extended trips to Taiwan.  In June 2002, Applicant\n7\nwas unemployed and had the free time to travel. She and her boyfriend went on a two\nweek pleasure trip to Taiwan. She traveled on her ROC passport, which was nearing its\nexpiration date the following month. With the exception of visiting a sister who was still\nresiding in Taiwan, but who has since moved, the trip was purely a pleasure vacation.8\nWhile on holiday, Applicant experienced some dental problems which caused her\nphysical pain and demanded immediate care.  \n9\nApplicant visited a dentist who proceeded to address a problematic wisdom tooth\nwhich required a root canal. Upon further examination, it was discovered that the tooth\nwas impacted and multiple root canals were required.  The dentist also identified all of\n10\nher wisdom teeth as having similar problems.   Such dental work then necessitated\n11\ndental crown molding and fitting. The price of the dental work recommended was less\nexpensive in Taiwan that it would have been in the U.S.  This was a major\n12\nconsideration given her lack of employment and insurance. She believes the dental\ncharges billed would have been the same price regardless of her nationality.  The\n13\nGovernment concedes that the dental work received was not a benefit of citizenship.14\nThe surgeries were conducted and medication was prescribed. Applicant was\nadvised against air travel before she had recovered.  Her boyfriend flew home.\n15\nApplicant remained in her sister\u2019s care through August 2002 before returning home.\nIn the interim, Applicant\u2019s ROC passport expired in July 2002. Before leaving for\nher trip, Applicant had no intention of renewing the ROC passport, having recently\nacquired a U.S. passport in May 2002. When her dental issues required she stay\nbeyond the expiration date, she had to apply for a replacement in order to return\n\n Tr. 14.\n16\n See, e.g., Tr. 14.\n17\n Tr. 16.\n18\n Tr. 43.\n19\n Tr. 42.\n20\n See, e.g., Tr. 29-30.\n21\n Tr. 46.\n22\n Tr. 54.\n23\n4\nhome.  Having recently acquired a U.S. passport, she had not previously considered\n16\nrenewing the ROC passport.  That replacement passport was eventually issued with a\n17\nJuly 30, 2002, date of issuance and it allowed her to leave Taiwan and return to the\nU.S.\nFour years later, the sister who Applicant visited in Taiwan emigrated from\nTaiwan to the U.S. Like the rest of Applicant\u2019s immediate family, that sister is now a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen.  Today, her only contact with citizens in Taiwan are with a a\n18\ncouple of casual acquaintances. Her main contact in Taiwan is a man she knew when\nshe was a schoolgirl. They chat in passing every few months as Internet pals.  \n19\nIn 2006, Applicant and the man she has since married were choosing a place for\na vacation. An offer was extended for her to attend a female acquaintance\u2019s marriage in\nTaiwan. When the wedding was mentioned to the Internet pal, he offered Applicant the\nuse of an apartment he owned at a very reasonable rate.  The couple consequently\n20\ndecided to accept the invitations and go to Taiwan in late May to early June for a two\nweek holiday. Applicant traveled on her U.S. passport. Once there, they attended the\nwedding and otherwise treated the trip as a pleasure holiday.21\nApplicant has never visited mainland China, has no plans to visit mainland\nChina, and has no immediate plans to return to Taiwan. If she wished to visit, she is\nunable to do so for the next four years due to an administrative mix-up with her 2006\nexit paperwork.  Her renunciation of ROC/Taiwan citizenship is considered permanent,\n22\nthus requiring her use of her U.S. passport should she ever return in the future.23\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n24\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n25\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n26\n Id.\n27\n Id.\n28\n5\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n24\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n25\n26\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n27\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n28\n\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n29\n AG \u00b6 9.\n30\n AG \u00b6 10(a). \n31\n6\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n29\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline to be the most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case: Guideline\nC \u2013 Foreign Preference. Conditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the appropriate sections\nbelow.\nThe concern regarding foreign preference is that when an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the U.S.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\n30\ninclude exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  At the\n31\ntime the SOR was issued, Applicant possessed a valid, current ROC passport, which\nwas sufficient to give rise to Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6\n10(a)(1) (possession of a current foreign passport). Previously unexplained, Applicant\u2019s\ndental work in Taiwan was sufficient to raise security concerns and give rise to FP DC \u00b6\n10(a)(3) (accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such\nbenefits from a foreign country). Similarly, her identification of herself as a dual\nU.S.\u2013Taiwan citizen gave rise to FP DC \u00b6 10(b) (action to acquire or obtain recognition\nof a foreign citizenship by an American citizen). With such disqualifying conditions\nraised, the burden shifted to Applicant to explain or mitigate the security concerns\nraised under this guideline.\nApplicant provided proof she successfully renounced her Taiwanese/ROC\ncitizenship and obtained the cancellation of her ROC-issued passport prior to the May\n2008 hearing, obviating the applicability of the disqualifying conditions identified above\nand the first two of the four allegations set forth in the SOR. Consequently, only the\nextensive dental work received in 2002 while in Taiwan remains at issue inasmuch as\ntwo pleasure trips to Taiwan are not sufficient to raise a FP DC alone.\n\n7\nIn describing her 2002 trip to Taiwan, Applicant explained the trip was originally\nplanned as a two week holiday with her then-boyfriend to visit Taiwan and see her\nsister. A dental emergency occurred, demanding immediate medical attention.\nUnemployed and uninsured, she decided to stay in Taiwan for care which would be\nboth immediate and which would cost less than it would in the U.S. A medical warning\nnot to fly during her recuperation, the necessity of multiple of root canals, and the\npreparation of crowns protracted her stay, as did the need to obtain a new ROC-issued\npassport to permit her to travel out of Taiwan once her old passport expired. Given the\nextensive and painful nature of the procedures described, her extended stay for\nmedical procedures and familial care is understandable. The Government conceded\nthat the dental care received was not a government benefit received based on her prior\nTaiwanese citizenship. Consequently, she has addressed FP DC AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) as well.\nWith only the fact that Applicant took two pleasure trips to Taiwan remaining, the\npotential disqualifying conditions raised have been nullified.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony, however, also raised foreign preference mitigating\nconditions (FP MC). Her former dual citizenship status was based solely on her birth in\nTaiwan, thus raising FP MC AG \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country). Applicant has not only expressed a willingness\nto renounce her dual citizenship, she has successfully completed the ROC-Taiwan\nrenunciation process, thus raising FP MC AG \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship). Finally, Applicant has also returned her ROC-\nissued passport to the appropriate authorities. It has been formally accepted and both\nofficially cancelled and facially marked as such. Therefore, FP MC \u00b6 11(d) (the passport\nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated) applies. With all of her immediate family, her husband, and her in-laws\nliving in the U.S. as U.S. citizens, with only a very small number of casual, infrequently\ncontacted acquaintances remaining in Taiwan, Applicant has little to no contact with\nTaiwan, ROC, or its people. Her life and her preferences are here in the U.S. In light of\nthe above, Applicant has mitigated foreign preference security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors noted above. Applicant is a mature, credible, and forthright individual who has\nsevered all official ties to the country of her birth. Her dual citizenship was nullified with\nrenunciation of her Taiwanese citizenship and her one remaining government benefit,\nher ROC-issued passport, was cancelled. Both her family and her husband\u2019s family\nhave emigrated to the U.S. en masse, and Applicant has been a U.S. citizen since she\nwas a teen. Her only remaining ties to Taiwan are two or three causal friends. \nToday, Applicant\u2019s sole country of preference is the U.S., and her only passport\nis U.S.-issued. No evidence has been presented that she has an residual indications of\nforeign preference which have not been addressed, nor is there any hint that she might\nbe prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the U.S.\nConsequently, foreign preference security concerns are mitigated. I conclude it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of the eleven allegations in the SOR relating to approximately $136,000 in delinquent debts. She denied the other allegations. Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a major government contractor working since September 2005 as a record management coordinator. She holds a BA degree in English and a Master\u2019s degree in library science. The largest of the delinquent debts arose from education loans for $121,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) accumulated during her period of higher education ending in 2002. The loans became delinquent and she began making payments on the loans of $300 per month. The creditor increased the payments to $1,500 per month. She could not pay this amount so she stopped payment in April, 2007. They became delinquent again. In February 2008 she negotiated a payment plan to pay $620 per month for six months (Exhs B-H). At the end of that period, November 2008, the amount will be re-set by the creditor and may be lower, higher, or the same. The second largest of the alleged debts totaling over $9,000 are for purchases of laptop computers from two companies during her student years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.,b.,c.,and j.). There is evidence in the record (Exhs. I and J, Tr. 27 and 37) that there was a dispute 3 with one company about one computer, and another was returned for a substitute. Payments were not made for the substitute. It was also returned to the company. In answers to her interrogatory in July 2007 (Exh. 3, p.",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\n             For Applicant: Pro se                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 5,\n2005. On March 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F\n(Financial Considerations) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 29, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May\n20, 2008, and I received the case assignment on June 5, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 6, 2008, scheduling a hearing on June 18, 2008. It was amended on\nJune 10, 2008 to set the hearing on June 17, 2008. I convened the hearing on that date. \nAt the hearing, the government offered six exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted in\nevidence without objection. Applicant submitted 13 exhibits which were admitted without\nobjection. She testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the\nhearing on July 1, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until July\n17, 2008, to submit additional evidence. No additional documents were received. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings\nNotice\nThe hearing notice was dated within 15 days before the hearing date. I advised\nApplicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing.\nApplicant affirmatively waived her right to the 15 days notice and indicated she was ready\nto proceed (Tr. 7). \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of the eleven allegations in the\nSOR relating to approximately $136,000 in delinquent debts. She denied the other\nallegations.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a major government contractor working\nsince September 2005 as a record management coordinator. She holds a BA degree in\nEnglish and a Master\u2019s degree in library science. \nThe largest of the delinquent debts arose from education loans for $121,000 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.f.) accumulated during her period of higher education ending in 2002. The loans\nbecame delinquent and she began making payments on the loans of $300 per month.\nThe creditor increased the payments to $1,500 per month. She could not pay this amount\nso she stopped payment in April, 2007. They became delinquent again. In February 2008\nshe negotiated a payment plan to pay $620 per month for six months (Exhs B-H). At the\nend of that period, November 2008, the amount will be re-set by the creditor and may be\nlower, higher, or the same. \nThe second largest of the alleged debts totaling over $9,000 are for purchases of\nlaptop computers from two companies during her student years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.,b.,c.,and j.).\nThere is evidence in the record (Exhs. I and J, Tr. 27 and 37) that there was a dispute\n\n3\nwith one company about one computer, and another was returned for a substitute.\nPayments were not made for the substitute. It was also returned to the company. In\nanswers to her interrogatory in July 2007 (Exh. 3, p. 6), Applicant indicated that\nnegotiations were underway with the companies. Nothing was offered in evidence at the\nhearing on resolution of the accounts. These alleged delinquent debts on her credit\nreports have not been satisfactorily resolved. \nThe third largest debt is on a secure credit card for $2,093 for a cruise she took in\n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.). Applicant disputes the charge, but it has not been resolved and few\nsteps have been taken to do so (Tr. 47-48). \nOther debts for medical payments (SOR \u00b6 1.g.), and telephone services (SOR \u00b6\n1.h.) have been paid (Exhs. G and L). Other debts listed on the SOR are disputed by\nApplicant, and are not on her credit reports of April 2008. \nApplicant is single and her income from employment is $46,000 per annum. She\npays $615 per month for rent which will soon be raised. She owns a 2006 compact car\nshe bought new with monthly payments of $485. With her payments on student loans and\nother living expenses she has a negative income of $367 every month which she is\nseeking to adjust (Attachment to answer). She is trying to find a second job but has not\nfound one (Tr.50). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\n\n4\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Ther relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and was\nunable or unwilling to pay the obligations for several years. The evidence shows that she\nhas been able pay some of the debts and has worked out a payment plan for her student\nloans. Yet very little has been done to resolve the outstanding issues regarding the laptop\ncomputers and the credit card charges for the cruise three years ago. Thus, the evidence\nclearly raises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes several mitigating conditions (MC) that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nMost of Applicant=s financial problems arose in the past ten years. She has a good\njob which pays a reasonable salary. She has paid some of the debts and is now making\n\n5\npayments on the student loan but in an amount she could not continue at her present\nlevel of expenditures. It seems likely that she should be able to resolve the outstanding\ndebts over time but a number remain unsatisfied. She has a number of unknown factors\nwith which to deal in reaching a sound financial footing. \nThose outstanding delinquent debts combined with the fact that she has, at this\ntime a negative income, continues to raise security concerns under the Guideline F.\nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is\na potentially mitigating condition under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not sought counseling\nso the MC is inapplicable.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. While it not necessary that\nall of the delinquent debts be resolved for mitigation to apply, it is necessary that a\nsignificant portion of the debts be settled or paid. The school loan debts, the largest in the\nSOR, now is being paid under an agreement with the loan consolidation company, but\nsignificant others remain unresolved. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall\ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nat this time. I recognize her expressed interest to resolve these financial issues to restore\nher credit rating. However, she took little action to resolve these delinquent debts even\nthough she has been employed over the past three years since her graduation. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising from these financial considerations. It is\npremature at this time to grant a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n6\n                           Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: Against Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in the case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied.\n_________________\nCharles D. Ablard\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on March 9, 2007.\nOn December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \n \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on January 30, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 4, 2008, and the hearing was held on March 26, 2008. At the\nhearing, three exhibits (GE 1 through 3) were admitted in evidence without objection to\nsupport the government\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s two exhibits (AE A and AE B) were received\nin evidence without objection. She also testified. In the time allowed for Applicant to\nsubmit additional documentation, she submitted AE C (in two parts) containing her\nApril 30, 2008\n\n2\nrequests to the state tax authority for her tax records, and their response. DOHA\nobtained a copy of the hearing transcript on April 4, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information\nis granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains two allegations under the  financial considerations guideline\nthat Applicant admitted. She is 57 years old, divorced, with four adult children. She has\nbeen employed as a functional/business analyst by her employer since August 2005.\nShe seeks a security clearance. \nAt the present time, three of Applicant\u2019s four adult children are no longer living\nwith her. The fourth child is attending community college, and will be leaving the\nhousehold in September 2008 when he meets his educational objectives. (AE A1)\nApplicant\u2019s mother lived with her for about a year following a stroke in 2004, but is\ncurrently living in a nursing home, with Applicant\u2019s brother providing most of the\nmonetary assistance. (Tr. 43-45) Applicant has paid for her father\u2019s medical prescriptions\nsince 2002. (AE B; Tr. 42-44)\nFrom 1989 to June 2005, Applicant was a software consultant for an organization\nestablished to monitor currencies throughout the world. She trained individuals on\nvarious software applications. Her tax problems resulted from not understanding the\nimmediate federal tax consequences of her job position status as an \u201cindependent\nconsultant,\u201d that required her to make quarterly rather than yearly tax payments. The\nemployment practice in the early 1990s was that employers did not hire full-time\nemployees to train other employees. Instead, hiring independent consultants meant the\nemployers did not have to pay them full benefits they had to pay full-time employees. (Tr.\n84-86)\nWhen she realized in 1991 or 1992 that she had to commence paying taxes\nquarterly as an independent contractor, she talked to an Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\nagent, and was given quarterly payment vouchers to pay the current and also delinquent\ndebt that hac already accrued. (Tr. 23) Though the record does not reflect how\ndelinquent she was in 1991 or 1992, Applicant recalled her persistent difficulties in\nkeeping up-to-date on her current taxes while consistently paying off any tax arrearage.\n(Tr. 24) She participated in periodic payment plans or tried to increase quarterly\npayments when she could, but sometimes the fluctuation in quarterly amounts occurred\nsimply because she was earning less money. (Tr. 53) Also, the amount of tax payments\nshe was making was impacted because she was still raising three of her four children at\nhome in the early 1990s. (Id.) \nIn the three college school years between 1996-1997, 1997-1998, and 1998-\n1999, Applicant decided to pay for her daughter\u2019s tuition when Applicant\u2019s former,\ncommon law husband indicated he was not going to underwrite the tuition after the\ndaughter\u2019s first year. (Tr. 28) Applicant even took out some loans to help her pay the\n\n Even though there is no documentation showing what tax years the payments were being applied.\n1\n3\ndaughter\u2019s tuition. (Tr. 57) She paid the tuition even though she was aware her tax debt\nwas continuing to accumulate. (Tr. 58) Her federal tax payment history (AE A3) was\nregular throughout the three-year period she was paying her daughter\u2019s tuition.1\nHowever, the payment history revealed no payments for the years 1993, 1994, 1995,\nand 1996, either on a quarterly or monthly frequency.\nAs AE A3 shows, her payment plan for the existing liens ended in April 2000 with\nher lump sum payment of $3000.00. She continued to make lump sum payments until\nApril 2005; her total payment between 1996 and June 2005 was approximately\n$83,585.00. (AE 3) Applicant was advised in January 2008 that new liens had been filed\n(or periods had been assessed but liens had not been filed) for tax years 1995, 1996,\n1997, 1998, and 1999, and the total amount of her tax liability would be $150,027.92. \nApplicant testified she made tax payments to the IRS even before the\ndocumented payment history (1993-2005). (AE A3) While she was not certain about the\nfrequency of the payments she made, she was positive she was making payments\nbefore 1993 of as much as $800.00 a month toward her current tax obligation or\narrearage. (Tr. 89-98) She stated, \u201cRight. I remember those significantly, because I\ncouldn\u2019t make that payment.\u201d (Tr. 97)\nIn November 2002, Applicant submitted her first offer-in-compromise (OIC) to\nsettle her outstanding debt with the IRS. (AE A10) She knew the $2,196.00 offer was\ninsufficient, but she was seeking guidance on the overall process, and willing to\nnegotiate. She was informed in December 2003 that her offer was rejected as too low\nbecause a larger amount was deemed to be collectible. She could not pay approximately\n$900.00 a month for 105 months under the deferred payment plan offer, either. \nBetween June and August 2004, Applicant made a second OIC. (AE A8) She\noffered approximately $16,000.00 (Tr. 29), but the IRS wanted a lump sum of\n$70,000.00. (Tr. 68) She hired counsel, and appealed. (AE A8) Her appeal of the IRS\ndecision was denied.\nAfter receiving an IRS collection notice in June 2005 (AE A9), Applicant decided\nto obtain a full-time job because independent consultant work was disappearing. She\nsubmitted a financial statement to the IRS. They subsequently recommended she\nresubmit an OIC when she had full-time employment. Even though she began full-time\nemployment in August 2005, her plans were to build a sizeable savings account and\nretirement account before she approached the IRS with another offer. Then, in\nSeptember 2008, she planned to return to the IRS with her third OIC proposal. (Tr. 32)\nAfter receiving the SOR in December 2007, Applicant moved up the timetable for the\nOIC by arranging for a $32,000.00 loan with her credit union (Tr. 33) that she has\nalready begun to repay. She filed the OIC on March 7, 2008 to settle the IRS tax lien of\napproximately $150,000, including penalties and interest. (Tr. 68; AE 4) If the IRS\naccepts her offer, Applicant would have bank payments of about $1000.00 a month for\n\n4\nthree years to satisfy the bank loan. (Tr. 69) Even after learning that she had filled out\nForm 433-A (Collection Information Statement for Wage Earners and Self-Employed\nIndividuals, part of the OIC presentation package) incorrectly by failing to include her\nmonthly tax payments on line 43 of page 4 of the form, Applicant was confidant that\nthrough more budgeting and part-time work, she would be able to make the monthly\n$1,000.00 payments on the bank loan. (Tr. 71-77)\nThe federal tax lien of $15,520.00 that was filed in December 1995 (for tax years\n1993 and 1994), and identified in SOR 1.b. was released on January 28, 2008. Though\nApplicant is certain she made some payments for the delinquent tax years covered by\nthe lien (Tr. 50), she did not know what the figure was because her documentation did\nnot break down the release into how much had been paid before the limitations statute\nextinguished the remainder of the debt altogether. (Tr. 54) \nOn reflection, Applicant is aware she made some poor decisions regarding her\nfinances. (Tr. 79) Though payment of her daughter\u2019s tuition exemplified poor judgment,\nApplicant is gratified she provided the tuition so her daughter could be where she is\ntoday. (Tr. 81) The federal tax liens are the only tax problems Applicant has remaining.\nIn the past she had state tax problems, but the problems have been resolved. See, AE\nC. Her current federal and state taxes have been up-to-date since 2002. (AE B, AE C;\nTr. 34)\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant considers herself a law-abiding citizen who does not have unhealthy\nhabits. (Tr. 35) For the appraisal period ending in July 2007, Applicant\u2019s performance\nevaluation was rated as superior, triggering a raise in her salary. (AE A11) Her\nretirement account carries a vested balance of $5,254.93. (Id.) She has kept her overall\ncard balances at manageable levels through regular payments (AE A6), while providing\nthe necessary documentation requiring another credit card company to issue a credit of\napproximately $638.00 to Applicant\u2019s closed account due to mistakes or changes made\nto her closed account. See, AE A12.\nAE 13 contains documentation showing Applicant\u2019s timely repayment of loans\nover the years beginning with: (1) a bank loan for $3,366.00 that she repaid in May 1993\n(AE 13); a student loan she repaid in June 1989; and, another bank loan for $4589.24\nthat she successfully repaid in May 1991. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor and\nconduct during the course of the hearing, I found her testimony credible. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\n18. The Concern. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \n\n6\nThe record shows that Applicant made a serious mistake in the early 1990s by not\npaying her tax obligations on a quarterly basis as required by her position as an\nindependent consultant. While she indicated that after she found out in 1991 that she\nwas required to pay quarterly because of her job status, she exercised seriously poor\njudgment in not devising a more effective way to pay her current taxes as she was\nmanaging the arrearage. Financial considerations (FC) disqualifying condition (DC) 19.a.\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies based on her inability, not\nunwillingness to pay her back taxes. FC DC 19.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) applies due to her 18-year history of financial difficulties. \nThere are four mitigating conditions that apply to overcome the adverse evidence\nunder the FC guideline. FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\napplies. Though she is still dealing with the federal liens in SOR 1.a. and more recent\nliens (AE 4), Applicant has brought her current state and federal taxes to a current status\nas of 2002. Moreover, the chances of her falling into the same kind of tax quandary in\nthe future is implausible because of her decision to terminate her independent consultant\nstatus in June 2005, followed by her acceptance of her current full-time position in\nAugust 2005. Though the federal tax problems are still present, the circumstances under\nwhich they occurred does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s good judgment and reliability. \nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) has no application to the origin of Applicant\u2019s financial problems because\nshe clearly made the decision to become an independent consultant in 1991, but failed\nto investigate the tax consequences of her decision. Applicant\u2019s ability to pay the IRS in\nthe early to middle 1990s was complicated by raising three of four children as a single\nmother. Applicant receives limited mitigation for these familial challenges. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s common law husband declined to pay tuition after her\ndaughter\u2019s first year in 1996, Applicant faced a choice of either \u201cpicking up the slack\u201d or\ncontinuing to deal with her own federal tax problems. She chose to help her daughter so\nthat she would not have to suspend her education at a critical time in her life. Applicant\neven obtained loans to ensure the daughter\u2019s tuition was paid. Although she knew the\nfederal liens would continue to increase, she still feels she made the right decision.\nApplicant\u2019s monetary assistance to her father since 2002, and her mother since her\nstroke in 2004 cannot be overlooked either. Applicant receives additional mitigation\nunder FC MC 20.b.\nThough the record does not indicate Applicant has ever received formal financial\ncounseling, her long-term relationship with the IRS between approximately 1991 and\ntoday, coupled with the financial challenges associated with raising her four children as a\nsingle parent for much of the time, has sharpened her financial habits and practices. She\nreceives limited mitigation under FC MC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving\n\n7\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) \nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant recognizes she made a mistake with her\ntaxes that has cost her dearly. Rather, than abandon her efforts to resolve her federal\nlien problems, she has made documented efforts to repay what she owes. Though her\nfirst OIC in 2002 may have been unreasonably low, she has continued to make\ndocumented efforts to satisfy the liens. Even though it is impossible to determine what\npart of the lien in SOR 1.b was actually paid off before the lien was extinguished by the\nstatute of limitations, I conclude from her payment history that some of the money was\napplied to the lien. Having weighed and balanced all the evidence, Applicant\u2019s payment\nhistory and her commendable efforts to repay the remaining liens, the FC guideline is\nresolved in her favor.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have weighed the circumstances of this case under the general factors of the\nwhole person concept. Applicant\u2019s failure to address her federal tax problems was\nserious. Applicant was almost 40 years old when she became an independent\nconsultant. She should have done her homework to find out about the tax consequences\nof her position. However, her tax lien payment history between 1991 and 2002\ndemonstrates she was not trying to shirk her tax responsibilities. In 2002, her yearly\nfederal and state taxes became current, even though the arrearage relating to previous\ntax years continues to grow via penalties and interest. In June 2005, she terminated her\nindependent consultant status, and took a full-time job with her current employer. She\nreceived a superior rating at her job in 2007. Based on her documented actions in trying\nto resolve the federal tax liens, Applicant has met her burden of persuasion under the FC\nguideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 11, 2007. On December 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E (Personal Conduct) for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMay 14, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 1, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received her response on January 7, \n2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 5, 2009, and I \nreceived the case assignment on February 10, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non February 18, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 3, 2009. On March 2, 2009, \nCounsel for Applicant entered an Appearance and a Request for a Continuance, which I \ngranted. On March 3, 2009, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing scheduling the \nhearing for March 18, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, and an \nAdministrative Notice Document, Exhibit (Ex.) I. The Government also offered a List of \nGovernment Exhibits, Ex. II. GE 1 through 5 were received without objection; however, \nCounsel for Applicant objected to GE 6 through 8 (except for page 1 of GE 8, which was \ncontained in GE 4) and Ex. I on relevancy grounds.

Her admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old supervisor for a company that provides security \nservices. She has been employed by her sponsoring defense contractor employer since \nJune 2007. One month after being employed, she was promoted to lieutenant. GE 1, Tr. \n114.

She is her children\u2019s primary caretaker, and the \nfather of her children shares financial responsibility with her. GE 1, Tr. 75-76.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nIn August 1998, Applicant resigned under adverse circumstances from her \nposition as a clothing store sales clerk. She had been employed for two months when a \nconflict developed between her and the store owner over her leaving the store during \nher lunch hour to cash her pay check. SOR \u00b6 1.e. In 2005, she held three jobs as a \nsecurity guard in which she resigned under adverse circumstances. The resignations \noccurred in April 2005, May 2005, and July 2005. Following her April 2005 resignation, \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nher two subsequent resignations followed jobs she held for a very short duration, i.e. \none-to-two weeks. Applicant\u2019s resignations primarily followed scheduling conflicts over \nher inability to exercise flexibility while fulfilling her responsibility as a single parent. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. \u2013 1. d. \n \nThe most significant concern identified from Applicant\u2019s past employment stem \nfrom her termination in May 2007. At the time, she was a security guard for a company \nthat provided contract security services, and failed to turn in her firearm upon \ncompletion of her shift to her supervisor. Such a failure was a violation of state law and \ncompany policy. She explained her failure to turn in her firearm was an honest mistake, \nand but for this mistake, she would still be employed by that company. Response to \nSOR. At the time of her termination, she had worked for this company for one year \nwithout a firearm incident. Tr. 115-116. She explained at the time she was hired by this \ncompany, she received one day of weapons training that was \u201ckind of rushed through\u201d \nbecause her employer was under pressure to fill positions to meet the terms of their \ncontract. Tr. 116.  \n \nTwo current supervisory personnel testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The first \nwitness was a Project Manager, who has supervised her for two years. He has held a \ntop secret clearance for \u201cprobably 30 years.\u201d He stated Applicant has received \nconsiderable training to include a 40-hour weapons course. He added that Applicant is a \ntrustworthy employee, complies with all company rules and regulations, and is \u201cvery \nreliable.\u201d He views her as one of his \u201ckey supervisors\u201d and if granted a security \nclearance, he would place her in a position of greater responsibility. He would rank her \namong the top 10 of his 20 supervisors. Tr. 30-45. \n \nThe second witness was a Training Instructor for her part-time employer. He has \nheld a secret clearance for nine years. He stated Applicant has had no weapons \nviolations while employed with his company and if she did, she would be immediately \nterminated. He described Applicant as an \u201cexceptional employee.\u201d Tr. 46-58. \n \n \nApplicant submitted two reference letters. The first letter was from her Shift \nSupervisor, who described her as \u201cgreat officer\u201d who has strong inter-personal skills \nadding she was a \u201ctremendous asset\u201d on a recent high profile event. AE C. The second \nletter was from another Project Manager, who described Applicant as \u201cdependable, \nreliable, hard working, and [e]xtremely dedicated to her family morals.\u201d AE D. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.1 \n \n \n1  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d2 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n2  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 15, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of:  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct leading up to her dismissal in May 2007 for failing to turn in \nher firearm warrants application of  these two disqualifying conditions in whole or in part. \nHer failure to comply with company policy and state law led to her immediate dismissal. \nApplication of these disqualifying conditions is less evident when attempting to apply \nthem to her four previous resignations in 1998 and 2005, which in large part stemmed \nfrom personality and/or scheduling conflicts.  \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to these \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant receives credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (d) for taking responsibility for \nher actions, receiving substantial additional firearms training, and having had no similar \nrecurrences. She credibly explained her failure to turn in her firearm at the end of her \nshift was an honest mistake. Understandably, her employer took a no tolerance policy \nfor her oversight and she paid the consequences. She understands similar mistakes are \nnot acceptable. Applicant\u2019s performance under her sponsoring employer as well as with \nher part-time employer has been commendable. Shortly after she was hired in June \n2007, she was promoted to lieutenant and fulfills a supervisory role. \n \nHer 1998 and 2005 resignations occurred eleven and four years ago, \nrespectively. In 1998, her two oldest children were ages 3 and 1, and in 2005 her \nchildren were 10, 8, and 4. As the primary caretaker for her children, she did not have \nthe flexibility of being able to adjust her schedule on short notice. In any event, this \nchapter on her life appears to be behind her as her children have matured and there \nhave been no reported incidents of similar employment conflicts. \n \nSince her 2007 termination, she has built up an impressive employment history \nto the extent that two supervisors testified on her behalf and two additional supervisors \nsubmitted reference letters on her behalf. They collectively describe her as trustworthy, \nreliable, personable, and an asset to their respective companies. \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior as it pertains \nto the 1998 and 2005 resignations as not recent and her 2007 termination as isolated. \nConsidering the subsequent rehabilitative measures she has taken coupled with her \nincreased maturity and favorable employment record, and other factors identified supra, \nI find her favorable information outweighs her past employment difficulties. Her record \nand accomplishments over the past two years alleviates questions about her ability and \nwillingness to follow the law and/or company policy. Applicant appears to be doing her \nlevel best to balance between the competing interests and responsibility owed to her \nfamily and employers. Based on the evidence presented, Applicant has sufficiently \naddressed concerns related to judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the personal conduct concerns raised as a result of her past employment \nrecord. She has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole person concept was given due \nconsideration and that analysis supports a favorable decision. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Le\u2019i, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the financial consideration security concerns. He paid or \nsettled and paid the seven debts listed on the statement of reasons (SOR). He does not \nhave any delinquent debt. Clearance is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 2, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86). On May 13, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to him,1 \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 13, 2008). GE I is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nOctober 7, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The \nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn June 15, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave an administrative judge decide his case after a hearing. On August 26, 2008, the \ncase was assigned to me. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 28, 2008. At the \nhearing held on September 18, 2008, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-\n5) (Transcript (Tr.) 10, 16-17), and Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-H (Tr. \n19). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-4 and AE A-H (Tr. 18-21). \nAdditionally, I admitted the Hearing Notice (GE 6), the SOR (GE 7), and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR (GE 8). I granted a delay until October 3, 2008 (Tr. 68, 70, 74). On \nSeptember 25, 2008, I received the transcript. Applicant provided additional \ndocumentation (AE I-N), which I received on October 3, 2008. Department Counsel did \nnot object to my consideration of AE I-N, and I admitted AE I-N. I closed the record that \nsame day.    \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted in his SOR response that he would take responsibility for the \nseven debts listed in the SOR and documented that he paid five of them in May 2008. \nHe said he was current on his payments to the last two creditors (GE 7, 8). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old.4 He graduated from high school in 1992 (Tr. 6). He \nattended college for two years and majored in computer programming (Tr. 6). However, \nhe has not completed his associate\u2019s degree (Tr. 6). He does not currently hold a \nsecurity clearance (Tr. 7). Applicant is now a career firefighter and emergency medical \ntechnician (Tr. 25). He married in June 2005 and does not have any children (Tr. 40, \n59).  \n \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GE 8 (Response to SOR) is the source for the facts in this \nsection unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4GE 1 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n                                           \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant began working for an insurance company in 1994 (Tr. 45). In 2003, his \nincome declined because of lack of sales and commissions (Tr. 40, 45-46). In 2003, \ntake home income declined to $600 a month (Tr. 41). His debts became delinquent and \nwent to collection (Tr. 41). He left the insurance business and became a government \ncontractor in 2005 (Tr. 47).5 Between 2005 and 2008, he paid off four or five non-SOR \ndebts including one for $6,000 (Tr. 62).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) lists seven delinquent debts. In his \nresponse to the SOR Applicant provided proof that from May 23 to 30, 2008, he paid or \nsatisfied the five smaller SOR debts: SOR \u00b6 1.a ($107 paid on May 30, 2008; GE 8 at 1-\n2); SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.d ($67 and $865 paid or satisfied on May 28, 2008; GE 8 at 1-2, \n5-6); and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. ($186 and $66 paid or settled and paid on May 23, 2008; \nGE 8 at 2, 7-8). Although he did not formally dispute the five small debts, he did not \nbelieve he was responsible for them (Tr. 57-58). Nevertheless he paid them after \nreceiving the SOR to alleviate any security concerns (Tr. 57-58). \n \n \nIn 2002 or 2003, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e became delinquent (Tr. 42). \nBoth of them were credit card debts. However at $14,245 and $10,458, respectively, \nthese two debts were still of some concern at his hearing as they had previously been \ndelinquent. As of June 2008, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e were current in that \nAppellant was making required payments (GE 8 at 1-2). In 2006, the creditors for the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e reached agreements with Applicant that he would make \n$100 monthly payments, and Applicant made those agreed upon payments for more \nthan a year prior to his hearing (Tr. 38-39, 42-43, 55; AE E-H). Applicant\u2019s $14,245 debt \nwas settled for $6,000 and paid on September 26, 2008 (AE K, L). The $10,458 debt \nwas settled for $8,381 and paid on September 30, 2008 (AE K, N). \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s current monthly gross pay is $4,300 (Tr. 49). \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly take-home pay is $2,400 and his wife\u2019s current monthly take \nhome pay is $1,200 (Tr. 48). They own their home and are current on their mortgage, \nwhich totals $113,000 (Tr. 48, 54). Their equity in their house is about $100,000 (Tr. \n48). They have $3,000 in IRAs, $1,500 in savings and $1,500 in checking accounts (Tr. \n52). The loans on both of their vehicles are fully paid (Tr. 52-53). Applicant\u2019s wife has \nthree credit cards, and they are all current (Tr. 53-54). \n \nApplicant received credit counseling in 2004 (Tr. 59). Their suggested debt \nconsolidation plan was impractical to him because he lacked the funds to implement it \n(Tr. 60-61). His spouse pays their bills and is conscientious about keeping their debts \ncurrent.    \n \n \n5The District Manager at the insurance company where Applicant was employed provided a letter \nlauding Applicant\u2019s loyalty, dedication and honesty as well as his solid reputation in the business. The \ninsurance company regretted his departure (AE C).   \n\n \n \n4 \n \nRecommendations \n  \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the last two years works closely with Applicant as they \nare on 24-hour-shifts together at the fire station (Tr. 23, 25). He described Applicant as \na good employee and worker, who is dedicated, trustworthy, conscientious and \nresponsible (Tr. 23-26). Another friend for the last 30 years has also worked with \nApplicant for the last two years at the fire station (Tr. 30). He indicated Applicant has \nplayed the organ at the church they both attend for many years and volunteers in the \ncommunity (Tr. 31, 32). He relates Applicant is honest, trustworthy, reliable and \nresponsible (Tr. 32). \n \nA third friend and co-worker at the fire station has known Applicant for fifteen \nyears (Tr. 35). He described Applicant as trustworthy, loyal and generous (Tr. 35). He is \none of Applicant\u2019s best friends (Tr. 36). \n \nTwo other friends, who have known Applicant for many years, and previously \nemployed him (AE A, B) describe Applicant as a generous, compassionate and diligent \nperson (AE A). One remarked, \u201chis attitude and job performance were unsurpassed.\u201d \n(AE B). Applicant is honest and has strong integrity (AE B).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                           \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n \n6See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR \nresponse and at his hearing. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g, he had seven \ndelinquent debts totaling about $26,000. The debts became delinquent in 2003. They \nwere not paid until 2008. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. Because there is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not \nisolated. The debts were not paid until September 2008, and therefore his debt is \u201ca \ncontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. \nOct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he \nreceives partial mitigation because his financial situation was damaged through \nunderemployment when he worked in the insurance industry. He lacked the income to \npay his debts. In 2005, he obtained his current employment and thereafter he has \nsteadily reduced his delinquent debt. However, he did not provide sufficient information \nto establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances from 2005 to May 2008.8  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant received financial counseling. He gradually \nreduced his delinquent debt and in September 2008 paid off the last two SOR debts. \nMoreover, there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.\u201d He understands the security implications of delinquent debt and will \nscrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. However, there is insufficient information to \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because Applicant did not meet his burden of \nshowing good faith9 in the resolution of his SOR debts. There is a paucity of information \nabout what he did to resolve the SOR debts between June 2005 and May 2008. \nMoreover, when he started making payments on his two large SOR debts, he could \nhave made larger monthly payments or resolved these two debts sooner, but failed to \ndo so.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to mitigate any SOR debts because the Applicant \ndid not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\u201d with respect \nto any SOR debts.    \n \nAlthough he did not formally dispute the five small SOR debts, he did not believe \nhe was responsible for them. Nevertheless within 30 days after Applicant received the \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nSOR, he paid those five SOR debts, even though he felt he should have disputed them. \nHe had been making monthly payments on the remaining two SOR debts for over a \nyear. Although Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts, his payment of the remaining two SOR debts in \nSeptember 2008 are adequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). For purposes of the whole person analysis in \nthis case, I will presume that none of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 apply.  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists seven \ndebts totalling $26,000 that were at one time or another delinquent during the last five \nyears. He failed to keep his accounts current and negotiate lesser payments when his \nincome decreased, showing some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His \nlack of success resolving delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit \nfurther inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is no evidence of any \nsecurity violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. Between 2005 and 2008, he paid off four \nor five non-SOR debts, including one for $6,000. His debts are current and his SOR \ndebts are all paid. His mortgage and credit cards are current. The loans on both of the \nfamily cars are paid. He currently does not have any delinquent debt. The Appeal Board \nhas addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \n\n \n \n9 \n \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is a fire fighter and emergency medical technician. He attended college, but \ndid not graduate. He is not sophisticated in the area of finance. He made mistakes, and \ndebts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. He has \npaid his debts. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt \npayments. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g: \n For Applicant \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR answer on May 22, 2008. In the answer,\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. I received the\ncase assignment on July 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 23, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 18, 2008. During the hearing, I\nreceived five government exhibits, eight Applicant exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 25, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old, married man with one daughter, age 16, and one\nstepdaughter, age 24. He and his wife have been married for nine years, and in a\nrelationship for 22 years (Tr. 43). After graduating from high school in 1979, Applicant\njoined the U.S. Marines, where he served until his honorable discharge in 1984. While\nenlisted, he served abroad as part of an international peacekeeping force, and was\nawarded the combat action ribbon (Tr. 9).\nFor the past 20 years, Applicant has worked as a U.S. military aircraft mechanic.\nSpecifically, he is an instrumentation and electronics technician (Tr. 9). He has worked\nfor the same company for the past 18 months. Before then, he worked for another\nemployer for 15 years. His supervisor characterizes him as \u201ca good and loyal employee,\nwho could be trusted in every facet of [their] maintenance and operational commitment\nto [their] customer\u201d (Exhibit A).\nApplicant decided to join the Marines shortly after graduating from high school.\nHis father disapproved of his decision. As Applicant was preparing to depart for boot\ncamp, his father, in a drunken rage, began taunting and physically assaulting him. After\nyears of physical abuse, Applicant had \u201chad enough\u201d (Tr. 37). He shoved his father to\nthe floor, and left the home. The next day, the police arrested and charged him with\nassault and battery. His father later dropped the charges, and the case was dismissed\n(Id.).\nIn 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DUI).\nLater, the court fined him, and ordered him to attend Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous (AA)\nclasses, and report to an alcohol monitor for a year (Tr. 53). He complied with the court\norder.\nIn January 1989, Applicant\u2019s friend stole a video from a video store while they\nwere leaving the store. The police stopped both of them, and charged them with\nmisdemeanor theft (Answer; Tr. 54). Later, Applicant received one year of probation\nbefore judgment and was fined $100.\nOne evening in May 1995, Applicant and his girlfriend got into an argument. He\nthen went for a walk to \u201cavoid any further confrontation\u201d (Tr. 32). When he returned, his\ngirlfriend had the hood of his car up, and was \u201cdislodging everything that she could\npossibly dislodge from under the motor compartment\u201d (Id.). He shoved her to the\nground, and his stepdaughter called the police, who arrived, arrested him, and charged\nhim with assault and battery. The charge was later nolle prossed (Tr. 34; Answer).\nIn February 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife shoved him during a heated argument. He\nresponded by shoving her, and she fell to the floor. Before hitting the floor, she hit her\njaw on the dining room table (Tr. 30). Applicant then drove her to the emergency room.\nWhile en route to the hospital, their argument resumed (Tr. 30). Applicant then stopped\nthe car, got out, and walked home. Before arriving home, the police stopped him, and\n\n3\ncharged him with assault and battery. He was later acquitted after his wife refused to\ntestify against him (Answer; Tr. 31).\nIn August 2006, Applicant was assigned to the night shift at his job (Tr. 23).\nWhen he would call home for his wife, she would not be at home, and their daughter\nwould not know her whereabouts. Suspecting that she was frequenting bars, he\nconfronted her one evening. An argument ensued, and he went to bed. When he awoke\nin the middle of the night, his wife was not at home. He then left the home, and\nconfronted her at a neighborhood bar demanding that she leave (Id.). He grew \u201cloud\nand aggressive\u201d when she refused (Tr. 24). A few of the patrons and an off-duty\nbartender then asked him to leave. \nThe bar environment grew hostile. Applicant, realizing he was outnumbered, left\nthe bar, and waited in the parking lot for his wife to leave. Approximately 10 to 15\nminutes later, a few of the men who had confronted Applicant in the bar, approached his\ncar \u201clooking for trouble\u201d (Tr. 25). One of the men tried to open the back door, and\nanother reached through the driver\u2019s side window, which was partially down, and began\ntrying to punch Applicant. Applicant then pulled the keys out of the ignition, and cut his\nassailant\u2019s arm with a bottle opener that was attached to the key chain.\nApplicant was arrested and charged with assault in the second degree, disorderly\nconduct, and trespassing. As part of a plea bargain, Applicant pleaded guilty to the latter\ntwo charges, and the assault charge was stayed pending the service of 18 month\nprobation (Answer; Tr. 29). Also, Applicant was fined $255, and sentenced to 60 days in\njail (59 days suspended, and one day credited for time served). Applicant served\nprobation without incident, and the assault charge was dismissed.\nIn July 2008, Applicant voluntarily enrolled in anger management therapy (Exhibit\nD). Since enrolling, he has attended three sessions. According to his therapist, he\n\u201cdemonstrates insight, takes personal responsibility for his behavior, and recognizes the\nneed to make changes\u201d (Exhibit D). In August 2008, he switched clinics to one that was\ncloser to his home and more affordable (Tr. 51).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\n\n4\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness and] by its very nature, . . . calls into question a person\u2019s\nability to abide by laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Applicant\u2019s history of criminal\nconduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses.\u201d After considering the circumstances surrounding the 1979 incident, as\nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f, and the length of time since it happened, I have\ndecided to resolve it in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nNevertheless, Applicant\u2019s remaining episodes of criminal conduct generate a\npattern of criminal conduct that raises questions about his security clearance-\nworthiness. Applicant\u2019s criminal offenses throughout the past 18 years have all\nstemmed from his periodically troubled relationship with his wife, and his inability to\ncontrol his anger. Applicant has begun to address the latter by attending anger\nmanagement classes; however, he did not enroll until nearly three months after the\nSOR\u2019s issuance. Moreover, Applicant and his wife have never attended marital\ncounseling, and he provided scant evidence as to the current status of their relationship.\nApplicant deserves credit for his service in the armed forces, his solid work\nperformance, and the initiative he demonstrated in enrolling in anger management\nclasses. Also, although his anger management therapy has just begun, he is actively\ninvolved and committed to its success. These favorable factors trigger the application of\nAG \u00b6 31(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d\nThese favorable factors, however, are not enough to outweigh the security\nconcern given the recency of the latest offense, the span of his criminal behavior, and\nthe minimal evidence about his current marital harmony. Consequently, Applicant has\nnot mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nUpon considering this case in the context of the whole person concept, I\nconclude Applicant\u2019s clearance must be denied. The awarding of a security clearance is\nnot a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on current disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions. Although Applicant\u2019s current circumstances do not warrant the granting of a\nsecurity clearance, he may well establish the requisite track record of rehabilitation to\nwarrant the granting of a security clearance in the future.

McGuire, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nOn February 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 12, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to another \nadministrative judge on April 29, 2008, and reassigned to me on May 21, 2008. DOHA \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nissued a notice of hearing on May 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled \non June 4, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant did not \nobject and they were admitted. The government also offered a chart as demonstrative \nevidence, which was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A-D. Department Counsel did not object and they were \nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 16, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Matter \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons by adding \nallegations that were raised at the hearing. Department Counsel provided a written \nmotion with the detailed allegations that was marked as HE II. Applicant through \ncounsel had no objections and the motion was granted. The additional allegations are: \n \n \nGuideline F:  \n \n1.i. You owe child support arrearage in [State A]. \n \n \nGuideline E:  \n \n2.c. You falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing, signed on November 30, 2006, in response to Section 14/15 Your \nRelatives and Associates \u201cGive the full name, correct code, and other requested \ninformation for each of your relatives and associates, living or deal, specified below\u20266. \nChild (Adopted and Foster Child also).\u201d You deliberately omitted two children. \n \n \n2.d. You falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing, signed on November 30, 2006, in response to Section 27 Your Financial \nRecord. \u201cc In the last 7 years have you had a lien placed against your property for \nfailing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d You answered \u201cNO.\u201d You deliberately omitted a \n2004 [State B] tax lien.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old security officer who has worked for a federal contractor \nsince December 2006. Applicant retired from the military as an E-7 and receives \nretirement pay.1 He was married in 1982 and divorced in 1984. He remarried in 1984 \nand is currently separated from his second wife and is going through a divorce.2 He \n \n1 Tr. 40. Applicant accepted an early retirement in 1997 and then entered the reserves and was \nrecalled to active duty in September 2001.  \n \n2 GE 1. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \npublished notice of the divorce in the newspaper because he does not know the \nwhereabouts of his wife and child.3 Applicant testified he had one child with his second \nwife and a stepchild for whom he provided support. He acknowledged he was not \nrequired to provide support for the stepchild, but has cared for her since she was an \ninfant.4 Applicant was asked if the child support allegation listed in SOR 1.c pertained to \nthe child with his second wife and he answered \u201cno.\u201d That allegation pertains to a child \nfrom a different relationship.5 Applicant was then asked the following question: \u201cWalk \nme through how many kids and who they\u2019re from?\u201d6 He acknowledged the child from his \nrelationship is 11 years old. He does not know where this child and mother are located. \nHe has been paying child support through the state for this child since she was born.7 \n \n \nApplicant has three biological children. On his security clearance application \n(SCA) he listed one biological child. The government had been unaware of the \nexistence of the other two children. One child is 22, one is 20 and the third is 11. He \npays child support for the 22 year old and 11 year old. When questioned why he was \npaying child support on a 22-year-old, he stated: \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re doing to me.\u201d8 \nWhen questioned further it was learned he is paying arrearages on child support he \nowed. He thought he was in arrears for two or three years. He could not answer why he \nfailed to pay his child support for this child or why he did not list all of his children on his \nSCA.  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he did not apply for the credit card listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, but rather his wife did. He became aware of the credit card in 2001, when he \nreviewed his credit report. He believes these two debts are duplicates. He did not \nprovide documentation to support his belief. He contacted the credit card company \nabout the debt, claiming he was deployed when the card was issued. They requested \nfurther information. No other information was provided about this debt. The debt has not \nbeen paid.9 \n \n \nApplicant completed his SCA in 2006 and in response to Question 27 which \nasked if he was delinquent on any debts over 180 days or if he had any debts 90 days \npast due, he responded \u201cno.\u201d He explained the reason he did not list the debts was \nbecause his employer was rushing him to complete the SCA.10 He stated he knew he \n \n3 Tr. 42. \n \n4 Tr. 42-43. \n \n5 Tr. 43. \n \n6 Id. \n \n7 Tr. 44-53; AE A and B. \n \n8 Tr. 130-131. \n \n9 Tr. 26-27. \n \n10 Tr. 53-54. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nwas delinquent 180 days on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1. b, at the time he \ncompleted the SCA. He stated: \u201cNow I may have at that time meant to, you know, put \na[n] X, but unfortunately, like I said, they was rushing us at that time.\u201d11 I find Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony was not credible.  \n \n \nApplicant was asked if he ever had a state lien against him for failing to pay child \nsupport. His response was: \u201cRight. Understood. No.\u201d12 Applicant was presented with GE \n2, a credit report, which reflects a state tax lien for $888. The lien was released. \nApplicant acknowledged being aware of the lien and confirmed that it was for back \ntaxes that had been owed because he failed to pay his taxes in either 1997 or 1998; he \ncould not remember. His explanation for why he did not pay his taxes on time was \nbecause \u201cAt that particular time, I wasn\u2019t making as much money.\u201d13 He went on to say \n\u201cMa\u2019am, at that time I never said I neglected it, but it was an oversight at the time.\u201d He \nthen explained \u201cThey eventually got paid. But the bottom line was at that time I was a lot \nyounger, and there were other things.\u201d14 Applicant paid this tax bill sometime in \napproximately 2000. He did not list this tax lien on his SCA as was required. \n \n \nApplicant believes the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. (a charged off account for \n$8,331) and 1.e (a judgment for $9,791 from January 2007) are the same debt. He did \nnot provide documentation to support his belief. He has been aware of the debt since \n2003 and stated he challenged the debt by phone, but no documentation was provided. \nHe stated this debt is for a car repossession. He claimed his wife was responsible for \npaying the loan on this car and failed to do so. He acknowledges he owes the debt, but \nnot the amount claimed.15 It remains unpaid. \n \n \nApplicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he owed the debt listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1. f (a judgment for $3,369 from May 2001). He became aware of it when he saw it on \nhis credit report. He was unaware of the judgment, but acknowledged he owed the debt \nfor a loan. The debt has not been paid. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a judgment for a dentist bill entered in March 1998 \n(amount owed $415). Applicant acknowledged that his daughter had dental work \ncompleted by the creditor and he was responsible for paying the bill. He disputes he \nowes the remaining balance. When asked if he ever contested the debt with the dentist \nhe responded \u201cNot as of yet, cause I didn\u2019t find out about it until she sent it to me.\u201d He \nclaimed he did not become aware of this debt until two weeks ago.16  \n \n11 Tr. 55. \n \n12 Tr. 56. \n \n13 Tr. 56-62. \n \n14 Tr. 56-57. Applicant was approximately 40 years old at that time. \n \n15 Tr. 27-28, 71-74. \n \n16 Tr. 75-76. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a judgment entered in March 1998 (amount \n$1,802). Applicant denied this debt at his hearing, but when confronted with his answer \nto the SOR where he previously admitted the debt, he acknowledged that it was his \ndebt.17 Applicant stated he has not paid this judgment, but he will.18 \n \n \nApplicant was asked if he had been delinquent on the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 2.a \n(2) he stated \u201cno,\u201d and further stated \u201cI have always been current.\u201d When presented with \nGE 2 and directed to page 5, where it showed the account was charged off for $1,287, \nApplicant\u2019s response was \u201cYes, but it\u2019s also paid.\u201d He then admitted at one time the \naccount was delinquent, but he then paid it.19 Applicant claimed he was confused about \nwhich account was at issue. He admitted that this account was delinquent. 20 I do not \nfind his testimony credible.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that after he pays his monthly expenses he has \napproximately $1,500 remaining in expendable income. He has a person who lives with \nhim and she pays some of the expenses. He also acknowledged he has approximately \n$47,000 in assets.21 He testified as follow: \n \nQ. \nMr. [Applicant], you also listed on your personal financial statement \nthat you had approximately $8,000 in savings; is that correct? \nA. \nThat is correct. \nQ. \nHave you increased that since the time you completed the financial \nstatement? \nA. \nHave I increased it? \nQ. \nIs it---do you have more than $8,000 in savings today? \nA. \nYes, sir. \nQ. \nApproximately how much in savings do you have? \nA. \nAbout ten thousand. \nQ. \nTen thousand. Is there any reason why you didn\u2019t use the $10,000 \nto pay off the debts we\u2019ve discussed today? \nA. \nI can. I\u2019d planned on taking my-like I said-refinancing my home, and \npaying everything off with my home. \nQ. \nBut you\u2019ve been made aware of these debts for, at the very least, \naccording to your testimony, two weeks; correct? You stated that \nthe dentistry bill you were only made aware of two weeks ago. \nA. \nRight. That is correct, sir. \nQ. \nBut you received the Statement of Reasons in February, correct? \nA. \nOkay. \n \n17 Tr. 76-79. \n \n18 Tr. 94-95. \n \n19 No documentation was provided to show it was paid. \n \n20 Tr. 79-82. \n \n21 Tr. 83-90. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nQ. \nI think the question is if you\u2019re testifying that you have $10,000 in \nsavings, why didn\u2019t you take some of that money and pay some of \nthese debts? You admitted that you owe some of these debts. \nA. \nThat is correct, ma\u2019am.22 \n \nApplicant went on to testify that he had $27,000 in stocks. He further testified: \n \nQ. \nOkay, so at the time you had $8,000 in the bank, you just testified \nthat that\u2019s up to about $10,000. Counsel\u2019s merely asking, you\u2019re \nlooking at me like I made that up. You just testified. \nA. \nNo, no, no. \nQ  \nThat $10,000, is what you testified that your savings has now \nincreased since you filled out this personal financial statement. \nA. \nNo. The savings have dwindled, ma\u2019am.23 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) which was completed on \nDecember 29, 2007, listed he owned three cars. At his hearing he testified he still owns \nthree cars, but one car is different. He stated he owned a 1990 Datsun, a 1994 \nSuburban24 and had a truck he sold and then purchased a 2006 Mazda. 25 He has a car \npayment on the Mazda. Applicant then contradicted himself several times. He was \nspecifically asked if had purchased any additional cars or were these the same two cars \nhe had. He confirmed he had purchased the Mazda. He did not admit to any other car \npurchases until he was questioned further. Applicant was asked about how many car \nloans he had. He testified one. When he was shown AE D and the car loan that was \nlisted, he testified that car was sold two to three weeks ago when he traded it in for the \nMazda he now owns. He confirmed that the car loan he is currently paying is for the \nrecent 2006 Mazda purchase. When he was shown there is a second car loan listed in \nAE D and asked about which car this pertained to. He testified that that vehicle was also \ntraded in for the 2006 Mazda. He confirmed he traded in two cars, a Toyota26 and a \nMercedes for the Mazda. The following testimony was provided: \n \n \n \nQ.  \nOkay. But wait a minute. What car was traded in? \nA.  \nThat was a Mercedes that I had, and the Toyota. \nQ \nOkay. And the Mercedes was\u2014you had it three weeks ago? \nA. \nYes; it\u2019s gone now. \nQ. \nAnd what did you owe on the Mercedes? \nA.  \n$25,000. \n \n22 Tr. 103-105. \n \n23 Tr. 106-107. \n \n24 Tr. 90-92. Applicant testified he had a 1994 Suburban, but later testified it was a 2000. \n \n25 Tr. 90. \n \n26 It is unclear whether Applicant owned a Toyota and was confused or whether he had another \ncar. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nQ. \n$25,000? \nA.  \nThat\u2019s correct. \nQ.  \nAnd when did you purchase the Mercedes? \nA.  \nThe Mercedes was purchased in 2006. No, 2007. \nQ.  \nWhen in 2007? \nA. \nApril. \nQ. \nAll right, Now you want to explain to me, when you put down three    \ncars, why didn\u2019t you just tell me back when you said, when we were \nask-when the Counsel was asking on your personal financial \nstatement, and you said, Oh, those three cars are the 1990 Datson, \nthe 2000 Chevy Suburban and the 2006 V6 truck. And now you\u2019re \ntelling me you also had a Mercedes. But you didn\u2019t tell me that \nbefore, did you? \nA.  \nNo. I didn\u2019t, ma\u2019am. \nQ.  \nYes. Why didn\u2019t you tell me that? \nA. \nI don\u2019t know, ma\u2019am.  \nQ.  \nSo you had four cars? \nA.  \nFour cars. That\u2019s correct. \nQ.  \nAnd you listed three? \nA. \nRight. \nQ. \nAnd one was a $25,000 Mercedes. But you neglected to list that? \nA. \nThat is correct, ma\u2019am. \nQ.  \nDo you have any explanation for that, Mr.[Applicant]? \nA.  \nNo. ma\u2019am.  \nQ. \nNone? \nA. \nNo.27 \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $100,000 in equity in his house and has equity in a \ntime-share28. He stated he has paid his taxes on time and \u201cI\u2019ve cherished my credit \nreport.\u201d29 He stated the following with regards to his delinquent debts: \u201cWhat I had \nplanned on doing was coming up with an agreement and just pay all the debts off....\u201d30 \nHe was going to refinance his home and pay them.31 He had not taken action on his \nplan because he was waiting to see how far \u201cthe market was going to go down.\u201d32 \n \n \n27 Tr. 109-111. \n \n28 Tr. 93. AE D is a credit report that shows that the time share account was opened in July 2006 \nand has a balance of $9,762. He is current on the payments. \n \n29 Tr. 94. \n \n30Tr. 95. \n \n31 Tr. 96. \n \n32 Tr. 114. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant testified he currently has about $4,000 in his savings and the reason \nthe balance has decreased is because he purchased furniture. He paid for it in cash.33 \nHe admitted he checked his credit report in 2001, 2003 and 2006 and was aware of \nsome of his delinquent debts. When asked why he did not do something about them he \nresponded: \u201cI can\u2019t answer that, ma\u2019am.\u201d34 Applicant testified he intends to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony throughout the hearing was evasive, incomplete, false and \ndeceptive. I find Applicant lied about numerous issues at his hearing and his testimony \nlacked credibly and was unbelievable. I find he deliberately and intentionally falsified \ninformation on his SCA. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n33 Tr. 125-126. \n \n34 Tr. 126-127. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant had \nnumerous delinquent debts that have remained unpaid for years, despite having the \nincome and assets to resolve the debts. I find both disqualifying conditions have been \nraised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe individual has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d); and (e) (\u201cthe individual has a \n\n \n10 \n \n \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid, despite his ability to pay them. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. I find (a) does not apply. Applicant claimed he was \noriginally unaware of some debts that his wife incurred and that his wife was \nresponsible or paying one of the car loans. He became aware of these issues as far \nback as 2001 and 2003 and has not resolved them. Although his wife may have some \nresponsibility for these debts they are listed in his name and he has not acted \nresponsibly toward resolving them. Therefore, I find (b) only partially applies. There is \nno evidence Applicant has received any financial counseling or that he has initiated a \ngood-faith effort to pay overdue creditors or resolve the debts. Applicant has not \nprovided documented proof of debts he disputes. I find none of the remaining mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d); and (b) (\u201cdeliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative\u201d) under this guideline. I have considered all of the facts and find \nApplicant deliberately omitted, concealed, misled, and falsified information on his SCA \nand at his hearing. He deliberately failed to list all of his children. He deliberately failed \nto list some delinquent debts, despite being aware of them for many years. He \ndeliberately failed to list he had a tax lien at one time. Applicant\u2019s testimony was often \nincomplete, misleading and false.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \n\n \n11 \n \n \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d). Applicant did not make an effort \nto correct the omissions and falsifications on his SCA before being confronted. His \nactions can not be considered minor because he failed to divulge information that was \npertinent to his security clearance investigation thereby casting doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. No evidence was presented to confirm he has \ntaken steps to reduce his vulnerability. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has had delinquent debts \nand judgments that he has been aware of and has failed to resolve for many years. He \nhas the financial means to pay these debts, but has not. He deliberately and \nintentionally failed to divulge information that was required for his security clearance \ninvestigation. I considered his demeanor and credibility at his hearing and conclude his \ntestimony was evasive, lacked candor, and was untruthful. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph    1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  2.a-2.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Accordingly, his request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), signed on December 8, 2006, to request a security clearance required as part of \nhis employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.

He signed a notarized Answer on \nMay 22, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted all the allegations in the SOR under Guidelines J and G, with explanations. \nUnder Guideline F, he admitted all allegations except for allegations 3.l. through 3.o. On \nJuly 7, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) \nin support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision to deny Applicant's request to be \ngranted a security clearance. The FORM contained nine documents, identified as Items \n1 through 9.  \n \nThe FORM and attached Items were forwarded to Applicant on July 9, 2008, and \nhe received the package on July 21, 2008. Applicant was given 30 days from the date \nhe received the FORM to respond. Applicant provided a timely response dated August \n19, 2008. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on September 2, 2008. \nHowever, as Applicant was working in a state that was approximately 2,000 miles from \nhis home, he requested an extension until he returned home and could gather and \nsubmit relevant evidence. Following receipt of Applicant's response, dated October 12, \n2009, the case was assigned to me on November 3, 2009, for an administrative \ndecision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 51 years old, is single and has no children. He earned college credits \nbetween 1996 and 1997, but did not complete a degree. He worked in his father\u2019s wood \nworking business for many years, but later he was unemployed from May 2002 to April \n2003.

As of the date of \nhis subject interview in July 2007, Applicant stated that he becomes intoxicated after \ndrinking 15 beers, and that happens about once per month. He did not believe that his \ndrinking had any effect on his work or home life, nor that his alcohol use was a problem. \n \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has had two alcohol-related arrests. In 1998, he was driving home from \na casino and was stopped by a police officer. Applicant was arrested and charged after \nhe failed the breathalyzer test. He was found guilty of Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol (DUI). His license was suspended, he was fined, and ordered to complete an \nalcohol education program. Applicant met the requirements of his sentence. He was \nalso charged with Driving with a Suspended License in August 2000, but the record is \nsilent as to whether this was an alcohol-related offense. In November 2005, Applicant \ndrank alcohol while visiting friends, and then drove home. He was stopped and \nsubsequently arrested on a charge of DUI. In July 2006, he pled guilty. He was fined, \nsentenced to one-year probation, and ordered to attend the same alcohol education \nprogram. Applicant completed the program. His probation ended in mid-2007.  \n \nIn his subject interview in July 2007, he stated that he does intend to continue \nconsuming alcohol in moderation in the future, but he does not drive after drinking \nalcohol. As of March 2008, he stated that he no longer drinks to intoxication, and \nconsumes \u201cdaily\u20141 to 3 beers in the evening after work and 6 beers on Saturday or \nSunday.\u201d (Items 5, 6). \n \n \nBetween 1980 and 1986, when Applicant was 22 to 28 years old, his illegal drug \ninvolvement resulted in conviction on criminal charges on five occasions. Applicant \nadmitted to the following (Items 6, 7): \n \n\u2022 In April 1980, Applicant was charged with five marijuana-related charges \nincluding possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and conspiracy. \nHe was found guilty of possession of marijuana and served 5.5 months \nincarceration;  \n \n\u2022 In June 1981, he found guilty of possession of marijuana and sentenced to \nserve 90 days;  \n \n\u2022 In July 1981, he was charged with possession of 20 pounds of marijuana \nand was found guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to \ndeliver. He was sentenced to five years confinement, with two years \nsuspended;  \n \n\u2022 In February 1985, Applicant was charged with possession of cocaine with \nintent to distribute and convicted felon in possession of a firearm. He was \nfound guilty of the first charge and sentenced to ten years (suspended). He \nserved approximately five months incarceration, and three years probation;  \n \n\u2022 In October 1986, Applicant was found guilty of possession of cocaine and \nsentenced to 10 years confinement. The record is silent as to the amount of \ntime he served. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts totaling approximately $36,000. In his \nAnswer, he notes that those alleged in the SOR at \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.k. are student \nloans, which total $34,300. He states that he does not recognize the four remaining \ndebts, allegations 1.l. thorough 1.o., which total $1,690. Allegation 1.l. is a state tax lien, \nwhich was filed in 1989. Applicant states that he has tried to pay it, but was informed \nthat \u201cno record exists.\u201d He does not recognize the debts at 1.m. and 1.n., which became \ndelinquent in 2006, but plans to research them. The debt at allegation 1.o. became \ndelinquent in 2000. As mitigation, Applicant contends that he was planning to \nconsolidate his student loans in October 2007, but was laid off from his job until \nFebruary 2008. The record contains no evidence of payments, but he states that he \nintends to resolve these loans, if he is granted a security clearance. (Items 3, 8, 9).  \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, applicable guidelines should be \nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy \nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this case, \nthe pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration of the \nsecurity concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guidelines G, J, and F. \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest3 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.4 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \n \n2 Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n4 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21). \n \n \nAvailable information raises two disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, \nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies \nbased on Applicant's arrests for DUI in 1998 and 2005. AG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) also applies. \nApplicant's long history of alcohol use, sometimes to the point of intoxication, as well as \nthe poor judgment he displayed by driving after becoming intoxicated. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes factors that can mitigate otherwise disqualifying \nconditions. The relevant factor, AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior \nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment), does not apply. Applicant\u2019s alcohol use is frequent, and it is not an \nunusual occurrence, as he currently drinks alcohol daily. Given the fact that he has had \nalcohol-related arrests, and continues to drink alcohol, I cannot conclude that his \nnegative alcohol-related conduct will not recur. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern pertaining to criminal conduct is that: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30). \n \n \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply. \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct going back to 1980. Applicant's offenses \nwere serious, and he has received sentences varying from five to ten years \n \n5 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nincarceration. Although his first conviction occurred when he was fairly young, his most \nrecent conviction was in 2005, when he was 47 years old. \n \nGuideline J includes two relevant mitigating conditions: AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time \nhas elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). There is no evidence \nthat Applicant's serious drug-related criminal conduct of the 1980s has occurred more \nrecently, which allows some mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d). However, as Applicant \ncontinues to drink alcohol, his alcohol-related criminal conduct may well recur in the \nfuture. His continuing alcohol consumption also raises doubts about his current good \njudgment. In light of these facts, I find against Applicant on Guideline J. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe record supports application of two disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b619(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). Applicant\u2019s debts started to become delinquent between 2000 and \n2006, and still appear in his 2008 credit bureau report. Applicant has allowed \ndelinquencies to accrue to the point where he carries a significant debt load, which he \nhas allowed to remain unresolved. Both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. Four mitigating conditions are relevant here:  \n \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation], and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b620(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are not in the distant past, as they remain unpaid. AG \n\u00b620(a) does not apply. \n \nThe key element in mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) is that the factors that caused \nthe financial problems were beyond the Applicant\u2019s control. Applicant did have a year of \nunemployment in 2002, and four months of unemployment in mid-2005. However, he \nhas been working steadily since 2005, and his unemployment is far enough in the past \nthat it would not affect his current ability to deal with his debts. Yet the record contains \nno evidence of efforts made to resolve his deals during in the past four years while he \nwas employed. Neither mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) nor AG \u00b630(d) can be applied. \n \n \nFinally, AG \u00b620(e) also does not apply. Although Applicant claims that he does \nnot recognize three debts, there is no evidence that he has taken action to dispute them \nwith the credit reporting agencies or to rectify his credit report.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guidelines. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult of 51 years. He has a history of criminal conduct from \n1980 to 1986, when he was in his 20s. It is to Applicant's credit that there has been no \ndrug-related criminal conduct since that time. However, Applicant has had a recurrence \nof criminal conduct with alcohol-related convictions in 1998 and 2005. He continues to \ndrink alcohol, which, in light of these convictions, raises questions as to his good \njudgment. Financially, Applicant carries a debt load of approximately $36,000, mostly \nattributable to student loans. While his attendance at college is certainly commendable, \nApplicant has provided no evidence that he has made any effort to pay his student \nloans or to establish a plan to do so. He does not recognize four other alleged debts, \nbut has not contacted the credit reporting agencies to dispute them.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not demonstrated the good \njudgment and reliability required in those who seek access to classified information. A \nfair and commonsense assessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts raised by his \nconduct. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.h.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.c.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a. \u2013 3.o.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \nallow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On July\n16, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines G and H are not at issue on appeal.\n1\nThe Judge found that as of the date of the hearing, Applicant was still serving probation for his 2006 DUI\n2\nand still pending disposition of a charge for driving with a revoked license.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline J is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant argues that the favorable evidence in the record was sufficient, as a matter of law,\nto mitigate any security concerns presented by Applicant\u2019s conduct.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\nIn this case, the Judge found that between 1995 and 2006 Applicant had been involved in\nseven criminal incidents, including Driving Under the Influence, Driving with a Suspended License,\nAssault, Menacing, Domestic Violence, Possession of a Controlled Substance and Carrying a Pistol\nin a Vehicle without a Permit.  A review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  Decision at 6-7.\nHe reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Id.   The Board does not review a case\n2\nde novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges seven alcohol-related incidents of criminal conduct. Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges a pattern of alcohol consumption to the point of intoxication during the period 1995\u20132006, and it refers to the alcohol-related incidents under Guideline J. And under Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant engaged in drug abuse by using cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana, and by misusing a prescription drug. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR and he provided a detailed explanation about his efforts to rectify his situation. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since September 2006. His educational background includes a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, and he currently works as a senior database administrator.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 29, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline J for criminal conduct, Guideline G for alcohol\nconsumption, and Guideline H for drug involvement. For the reasons discussed below,\nthis case is decided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nJuly 16, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on April 7, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 19, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on June 25, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 3, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges seven alcohol-related incidents of criminal\nconduct. Under Guideline G, the SOR alleges a pattern of alcohol consumption to the\npoint of intoxication during the period 1995\u20132006, and it refers to the alcohol-related\nincidents under Guideline J. And under Guideline H, the SOR alleges Applicant\nengaged in drug abuse by using cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana, and by\nmisusing a prescription drug. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nthe SOR and he provided a detailed explanation about his efforts to rectify his situation.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since September 2006. His educational background includes a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, and he currently works as a senior database\nadministrator. His manager is very satisfied with Applicant\u2019s work performance and\ndescribes Applicant as a \u201chighly competent, completely reliable, and absolutely\ntrustworthy\u201d employee (Exhibit A).  \nApplicant is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance. To that end, he\ncompleted security-clearance applications in October and December 2006 (Exhibits 1\nand 2). In each, he reported that he was a recovering alcoholic and  disclosed multiple\nalcohol-related offenses. Also, he disclosed his use of cocaine, crack cocaine,\nmarijuana, and his misuse of the prescription drug. \nHe married in 1987 and divorced in 1994. There is one child from the marriage, a\nson. Alcohol was not a problem during the marriage, but it appears his problems with\nalcohol started after the divorce. Both he and his ex-wife attribute his substance-abuse\nproblems to falling in with the wrong crowd (Tr. 78, 121\u2013122). At one point in 2006, his\nwife became concerned enough about his condition that she refused to allow him to see\ntheir son, although that is no longer the case.\n\n3\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, which he does not dispute. The\nseveral incidents alleged in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are summarized as\nfollows:\n\u2022\nAugust 1995\u2013arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of\nalcohol; pleaded guilty.\n\u2022\nSeptember 1998\u2013arrested and charged with DUI, driving with a suspended\ndriver\u2019s license, and carrying a pistol in a vehicle without a permit; guilty of DUI\nand the other charges against him were nolle prossed.\n\u2022\nMay 2000\u2013arrested and charged with third-degree assault and menacing; he had\nbeen drinking alcohol at the time. Charges dismissed.\n\u2022\nJune 2004\u2013arrested and charged with third-degree domestic violence; he had\nbeen drinking alcohol at the time. Charge dismissed.\n\u2022\nDecember 2004\u2013arrested and charged with DUI; found guilty of lesser offense of\nopen container.\n\u2022\nSeptember 2005\u2013arrested and charged with DUI; pleaded guilty.\n\u2022\nFebruary 2006\u2013arrested and charged with DUI and possession of a controlled\nsubstance (a prescription drug); guilty of DUI and the possession charge was\ndismissed.\nThe most recent incident is discussed below.\nThe February 2006 charges were adjudicated in approximately March 2007, and\nthe court sentenced Applicant to serve confinement for one year (suspended) and\nprobation for two years. His probation was scheduled to conclude in March 2009 (Tr.\n111). According to his court-referral officer (probation officer), as of March 26, 2008,\nApplicant was in good standing and had completed 6 of 12 monitoring sessions, passed\ndrug screens, and attends Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings four times per week\n(Exhibit H). In addition to the criminal case, on March 21, 2007, the state\nadministratively revoked Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license for four years (Tr. 118\u2013120). \nAlthough his license is revoked, Applicant has been driving on a regular basis\n(Tr. 115\u2013121, 125\u2013127). Several days before the hearing in this case, on June 14,\n2008, the police stopped Applicant because his vehicle matched the description of a\nstolen vehicle. As a result, the police discovered and cited Applicant for driving with a\nrevoked driver\u2019s license. Applicant was not arrested, but was given a court date of July\n11, 2008. He had not yet reported the incident to his probation officer, but he had plans\nto do so.  He has continued to drive after the incident on June 14, although he is trying\nto minimize his driving.   \nApplicant has abstained from alcohol and drug abuse since May 16, 2006. He no\nlonger associates with people who abuse alcohol or drugs, and he no longer goes to\nbars or nightclubs. He is an active participant in AA, he is quite familiar with the 12-step\nprogram and is working the program, and he attends several AA meetings per week. In\naddition to attending AA, he was also active in a church-based 12-step program led by a\nqualified counselor (Exhibit G). Also, he has been under the care of a medical doctor\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The main focus is\ntreating Applicant\u2019s depression and other issues related to his recovery. He has made\ngood progress and is clinically stable. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n16\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n17\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n DC 4 is the \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\n18\n5\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n14\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n15\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct.\nIn particular, DC 1,  DC 3,  and DC 4  apply against Applicant as evidenced by his\n16\n17\n18\nmultiple arrests, charges, and convictions, as well as his status as a probationer until\nMarch 2009. In addition, his admitted practice of driving with a revoked driver\u2019s license\nis of concern because it shows a willful disregard of the law. Although the state court\nhas not yet determined the outcome of the June 14 incident, it is a misdemeanor\n\n See Ala. Code 1975 \u00a7 32-6-19 (driving a motor vehicle while a license is cancelled, denied, suspended, or\n19\nrevoked is a misdemeanor that carries with it a penalty of a fine of $100 to $500 and imprisonment for not\nmore than 180 days.).  \n Revised Guidelines at 15\u201316 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n20\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 15. \n21\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n22\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n23\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n24\n6\ncriminal offense.  This means that Applicant is facing the possibility of yet another\n19\nconviction, a probation violation, or the state court could set aside or vacate the\nsuspended sentence to confinement, or all three. To sum up, the totality of Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal conduct calls into question his judgment as well as his ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns, but none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. It is true that Applicant has abstained\nfrom alcohol and drug abuse since March 2006. But the 2006 DUI was not resolved until\n2007, and Applicant is now a probationer until about March 2009. This means he is now\nserving a lawful sentence imposed by a state court. In addition, he was pending\ndisposition of a misdemeanor offense for driving with a revoked license with a court date\nof July 11, 2008; this may also constitute a probation violation. These are key facts.\nThey show that Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is current and ongoing, and they militate\nagainst a successful case in reform and rehabilitation. In other words, it is too soon to\ntell if Applicant will serve probation without violation and then go on to be a law-abiding\ncitizen. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. \nThe alcohol consumption and drug involvement guidelines will be discussed\ntogether because Applicant\u2019s drug abuse was intertwined with his alcohol use. Under\nGuideline G for alcohol consumption,  the security concern is that \u201cexcessive alcohol\n20\nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to\ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\u201d  Under Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that\n21\n22\n\u201cuse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use\n23\nof a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d24\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol-related incidents and his drug abuse raise security\nconcerns. But unlike his criminal conduct\u2014which is an ongoing concern\u2014he has\n\n7\nsuccessfully resolved the concerns under Guidelines G and H. Importantly, he has\nacknowledged that he is a recovering alcoholic. He has abstained from alcohol and\ndrugs since March 2006, a period of more than two years. He has sought out\nprofessional counseling and medical assistance. He attends AA regularly and is actively\nworking the 12-step program. And he no longer associates with people who abuse\nalcohol and drugs. Taken together, his efforts constitute substantial evidence of reform\nand rehabilitation. On this  basis, Guidelines G and H are decided for Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept (to include his good employment record, his\nseveral favorable character witnesses, Exhibits A\u2013Q, and his rehabilitation efforts) was\ngiven due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. This\ncase is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132b:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a\u20133c:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

During the\nhearing, I received four Government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At the close of\nthe hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request, to allow her to submit\ndocuments. Applicant then submitted seven documents that I incorporated into the\nJuly 28, 2008\n\nApplicant has been taking prescription depression medication since 1997 (Tr. 46).\n1\n2\nrecord.

In 1997, the year she\nand her first husband separated, she was hospitalized for three days after a prescription\nmedication overdose (Tr. 45). The treatment costs totaled approximately $14,000.\nApplicant did not have health insurance benefits at the time, and was unable to pay it. A\njudgment was rendered against her on this debt in 2003 (Answer, SOR subparagraph\n1.v).\nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s divorce was finalized (Exhibit 1 at 17). That year, she also\nobtained a job with health benefits (Id. at 14). In May 2001, she purchased a car (Exhibit\n3 at 5). Three months later, she remarried (Id. at 17). Her second husband owned a\nhome worth approximately $200,000 (Tr. 47). Before they married, he had operated a\nbusiness that generated approximately $500,000 in yearly revenue (Tr. 48). Although he\nno longer operated the business when he married Applicant, he had received a\nsignificant cash settlement from litigation related to the business\u2019 termination (Tr. 48).\nHe invested it in the stock market, and \u201cdecided not to work\u201d (Tr. 17). Applicant then\nbegan making mortgage payments on their home without any assistance (Tr. 18). \nApplicant purchased another car in February 2002 (Exhibit 3 at 13). Shortly\nthereafter, her husband\u2019s stock market investments began failing, and he still refused to\nwork. Applicant then lost her job (Tr. 17, Exhibit 1 at 14). \nApplicant could no longer afford the car payments for her two automobiles, and\nshe called the car dealer to arrange for their voluntary repossession (Tr. 24). For the\nnext three years, she struggled to make ends meet by working a variety of part-time,\nmenial jobs. None of them provided health insurance benefits (Tr. 43), and she\ncontinued to experience health problems.  \n1\n\nSOR subparagraph 1.s is a duplicate of SOR subparagraph 1.o. \n2\nApplicant acknowledges the delinquencies listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i, but has not been\n3\nable to determine the original creditors.\n3\nOver the years, Applicant has received little assistance with child support from\nher first husband. In 2001, with the help of an attorney, she successfully obtained a\nmodification of the child support order. Her ex-husband continued not to make\npayments (Tr. 41). Currently, he owes $43,000 of delinquent child support payments\n(Tr. 18).\nBy approximately 2007, Applicant owed creditors approximately $58,000 of\ndelinquent debt, as listed in the SOR, including medical bills(SOR subparagraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.d, 1.f, 1.n, 1.u, and 1.v), utilities (SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g), credit\ncards (SOR subparagraphs 1.j through 1.q),  the remaining deficiencies from two\n2\nautomobile repossessions (SOR subparagraphs 1.r and 1.t, as described above), and a\nrent delinquency (SOR subparagraph 1.y).  \n3\nSOR subparagraphs 1.k through 1.m are owed to the same creditor (Exhibit 4).\nThis creditor obtained judgments, as listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.w and 1.x, on two\nof these accounts (Tr. 51). It is unclear from the record which of the accounts the\njudgments correspond (Tr. 50-51).\nIn March 2008, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. During the bankruptcy\nprocess, she received one session of financial counseling by telephone from a credit\ncounseling company (Exhibit B). In the years preceding her bankruptcy filing, she had\nneither received any counseling nor attempted to make any payment arrangements with\nher creditors (Tr. 31). On July 8, 2008, the bankruptcy court discharged the debts\n(Exhibit G).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s longstanding financial problems trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may\nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nTwo consecutive troubled marriages, her first husband\u2019s failure to pay child\nsupport, a history of health problems, and frequent underemployment have contributed\nto Applicant\u2019s financial problems. In March 2008, Applicant filed for a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge, and in July 2008, a bankruptcy court discharged all of her\ndelinquencies.\nBefore filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy Applicant had never sought financial\ncounseling. Also, when her finances improved briefly between 1999 and 2001, she\nappears to have made no effort to satisfy any of the debts that had accrued to that\npoint. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s efforts at obtaining a discharge of her delinquencies\nmerits some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d but I cannot conclude she acted\nresponsibly enough under the circumstances to apply the mitigating condition listed in\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n5\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused primarily by circumstances beyond her\ncontrol, and have recently been discharged through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process.\nAbsent a demonstrated track record of financial reform, and the age, number and the\namount of the discharged delinquencies, it is too soon to conclude that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems no longer pose a security risk.\nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is\nbased on current disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Although Applicant\u2019s current\ncircumstances do not warrant the granting of a security clearance, she may well\nestablish the requisite track record of financial reform to obtain a security clearance in\nthe future. Such a judgment at this point, however, would be premature. Clearance is\ndenied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.t - 1.y:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",
