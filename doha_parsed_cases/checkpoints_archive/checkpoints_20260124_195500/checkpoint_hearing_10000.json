On June 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 15, 2009, and requested a \nhearing. On August 21, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On September 21, 2009, \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the case for October 15, 2009. The case was \nheard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through G \ninto evidence without objection. The record remained open until October 30, 2009, to \ngive Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. She timely submitted a \ndocument that I marked as AE H and admitted into the record without objection from \nDepartment Counsel.

She denied the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and \n1.h.  \n \n \nApplicant is 65 years old. She is divorced since 1983 and has three grown \nchildren. She has three years of college and a technical degree in online programming \nand system administration. She has worked as a contractor in both the private and \npublic sectors over the past ten years. From 1999 to September 2001, she worked as a \ncommunications contractor for a private company located in the World Trade Center \nTowers. She was then unemployed until May 2002 when she obtained a state \ngovernment contract in her home state that lasted for seven months. From December \n2002 until May 2003, she was unemployed. She then obtained a position with another \nprivate company, where she worked until November 2004. For the next eight months \nshe was unemployed. In June 2005, she obtained a two-month contract for a private \ncompany. In August 2005, she worked in private industry. In May 2006, she went to \nwork for another private company until February 2007 when she became unemployed \nFrom May 2007 to April 2008, she worked for a private firm. She was then unemployed \nuntil September 2008, when she started her current contract position with a defense \ncontractor. (GE 1.) \n \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in order to establish a \nrepayment plan for her delinquent debts, which were accruing as a result of periods of \nunemployment. (Tr. 25.) The case was dismissed because she did not timely file a \nrepayment plan. At that time, she was trying to sell her house, which she purchased for \n$225,000, and was appraised at less than $190,000. (Tr. 26.) She re-filed for \nBankruptcy in December 2003, hoping to give herself more time to sell. Although she \nhad several buyers for her home, the mortgage company would not agree to a \u201cshort \nsale\u201d. Despite depleting her savings and retirement accounts, she was unable to \nmaintain her mortgage payments, car payments, or other expenses. (Tr. 47.) In July \n2003, the court dismissed the case for her failure to make payments to the bankruptcy \ntrustee. (Tr. 26-27.)  \n \n \nThe majority of the delinquent debt listed on the SOR accrued from September \n2001 to August 2003. As stated above, Applicant was unemployed for 15 months during \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nthis time. (Tr. 28.) Her financial situation started to improve in May 2005 when she \nobtained work on a more regular basis, after being unemployed for eight more months. \n(GE 2; Tr. 48.) Prior to the 2001 to 2003 time frame, she never experienced financial \nproblems. (Tr. 43.) Her finances appear to have stabilized since starting her current \nposition. \n \n \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In April 2009, she responded \nto the government\u2019s interrogatories about her delinquent debts, including six of those \nsubsequently listed in the SOR. She explained that she was unaware that the debts \nremained on her credit report and thought all of them had been resolved, except for the \nsecond mortgage on her previous house that the bank foreclosed upon in 2003. (GE 2.) \nShe was not aware that she could resolve charged-off debt and believed that she no \nlonger was responsible for it once a creditor took a tax write-off. (Tr. 52.) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated May 2009 and October 2007, the \nJune 2009 SOR alleged security concerns based on the accumulation of eight \ndelinquent debts totaling $60,146. The status of each of those debts is as follows:  \n \n  \n1. (\u00b6 1.c) The $41 medical debt was paid on July 13, 2009. (AE A.) \n \n2. (\u00b6 1.d) The $487 debt was owed to a cellular telephone company. It was paid \nin August 2009. (AE B.)  \n \n3. (\u00b6 1.e) The $31,000 debt is owed to a bank for a second mortgage that was \non her previous home, which was foreclosed upon and sold in 2003. The \nmortgage amount was originally for $10,000. It was reported delinquent in \nJuly 2003. (GE 2; Tr. 36) It is unresolved. \n \n4. (\u00b6 1.f) The $2,182 debt is owed to a department store for a refrigerator that \nApplicant purchased for her previous house and remained in the foreclosed \nhouse when she moved out in 2003. It became delinquent in March 2003 and \nis unresolved. (GE 4; Tr. 37.)  \n \n5. (\u00b6 1.g) The $2,131 debt is owed to a credit card company for living expenses \nApplicant incurred between October 2001 and January 2003. It was reported \ndelinquent in September 2008. It was charged off by the creditor. (GE 2; Tr. \n27.) It is unresolved.  \n \n6. (\u00b6 1.h) The $15,000 debt is owed to a car company for the unpaid portion of a \nthree-year lease that Applicant signed in September 2001. It became \ndelinquent in September 2002 and is unresolved. (GE 2; Tr. 38.)  \n \n7. (\u00b6 1.i) The $2,415 debt is owed to a department store for a computer \nApplicant purchased in September 2001. It became delinquent in March \n2003. It was charged off by the creditor. (Tr. 40; GE 2.) It is unresolved. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n8. (\u00b6 1.j) The $6,890 debt is owed to a credit card company for expenses \nApplicant charged while trying to manage her mortgage and other bills. It \nbecame delinquent in July 2004. It was charged off by the creditor. It is \nunresolved. (GE 2; Tr. 41.)  \n \n \nIn summary, all of the delinquent debt, except $528, remains unresolved. On \nOctober 26, 2009, Applicant enrolled in a debt resolution program with a company that \nspecializes in credit and debt counseling. The company is in the process of investigating \nher delinquent debts. (AE H.) She does not have an objection to paying the outstanding \nbills if she could arrange a payment within her budget. (Id.)  \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of her budget. Her net monthly income is $4,809 and \nexpenses are $3,849, including a payment on her car loan and large monthly \nmedication expenses of $651. (GE 2; Answer.) She has approximately $167 at the end \nof the month for other expenses. She stated that all of her other bills are current. (AE D, \nE, F.)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted ten letters of recommendation, highly supportive of her \nefforts to obtain a security clearance. (AE G.) The Information Technology Director, who \nhas worked with Applicant for a year, considers her to be very competent and ethical. \n(AE G at 1.) The Vice President of Operations where Applicant works stated that \nApplicant has \u201cshown her business ethics to be nothing short of exemplary.\u201d (AE G at \n9.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies that \nbegan in September 2001 and remain unpaid or unresolved at the present. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s problems are ongoing, not \nisolated, and did not occur so long ago nor under circumstances that are so unusual \nand unlikely to recur. There is evidence that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts accrued as a \nresult of periods of unemployment from September 2001 to September 2008 for a total \nof 30 months. The majority of the delinquent debts accrued from 2001 to 2003; however \none debt became delinquent in 2008. There is some evidence that she attempted to \nresponsibly manage her mortgages and other debts during 2003 through a Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy, however she failed to follow-through on her efforts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited \napplication. Applicant very recently contacted a credit counseling and debt resolution \ncompany in order to investigate and resolve her delinquent debts. Hence, there is \ninsufficient evidence to indicate that the debts are under now control, as required under \nAG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant provided proof that she paid two debts, demonstrating a good-\nfaith effort to pay resolve them and warranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(d) to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d. There is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(e) or AG \u00b6 20(f).     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 65-year-old educated \nwoman, who is dedicated to her job and has received recommendations from many of \nher colleagues. From September 2001 to September 2008, she experienced 30 months \nof unemployment leading to financial problems that were particularly exacerbated \nbetween 2001 and 2003, when the bank foreclosed on her home. Although she is \nconsistently paying her current bills, she has not taken any action to resolve the \napproximate $60,000 of outstanding debt owed on her previous mortgage, car lease, \nand credit cards, including one that became delinquent in September 2008, despite \nbeing notified of the government\u2019s concerns in April 2009.  She testified that she did not \nknow that she could pay her charged-off debts and appeared to be unaware of the \neffect that financial delinquencies could have on her employment. To demonstrate her \nwillingness to resolve the old debts, she sought credit counseling and debt resolution \nimmediately after the hearing. However, at this time, she has not provided sufficient \nevidence establishing a track record of debt management.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant \ndid not mitigate the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 31, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On February 3, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant argues that the security concerns raised by his\nfinancial situation should be completely mitigated.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is an aerospace engineer\nand is married with two children.  In his response to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted five\nof the seven alleged delinquent debts, and during the hearing admitted the other two.  Applicant\nprovided testimony regarding the origin of his financial difficulties.  Applicant\u2019s current delinquent\ndebts exceed $300,000 in total.  Applicant served three years in the U.S. Navy and received an\nhonorable discharge.  He had debt discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000 after his parents\nwere killed in an accident and his first wife left him.  Applicant also provided positive character\nletters attesting to his good character and patriotism.  In his decision, the Judge focused on\nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve any of his delinquent debt.         \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant states that he did not hire an attorney to represent him at the\nhearing because of the expense involved.  Applicant indicates that he wishes to restate his case,\nbecause he did not fully understand the Directive, and therefore the answers he provided at the\nhearing were not as complete as they should have been.  Applicant\u2019s appeal brief also contains\nevidence of steps he has taken since the hearing to improve his financial situation.  At the hearing,\nApplicant testified that he was a college graduate; he also stated that he had received a copy of the\nDirective and had read and understood it.  Tr. at 5.  The Judge found that Applicant was able to\nrepresent himself.  Id.  During the hearing, Applicant never indicated that he did not understand the\nDirective or the proceedings.  Moreover, the Judge kept the record open after the hearing, and\nApplicant submitted further evidence.  Applicant had a full opportunity to present his case.

In his response to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted five of the seven alleged delinquent debts, and during the hearing admitted the other two. Applicant provided testimony regarding the origin of his financial difficulties. Applicant\u2019s current delinquent debts exceed $300,000 in total. Applicant served three years in the U.S. Navy and received an honorable discharge. He had debt discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000 after his parents were killed in an accident and his first wife left him. Applicant also provided positive character letters attesting to his good character and patriotism. In his decision, the Judge focused on Applicant\u2019s failure to resolve any of his delinquent debt. In his appeal brief, Applicant states that he did not hire an attorney to represent him at the hearing because of the expense involved. Applicant indicates that he wishes to restate his case, because he did not fully understand the Directive, and therefore the answers he provided at the hearing were not as complete as they should have been. Applicant\u2019s appeal brief also contains evidence of steps he has taken since the hearing to improve his financial situation.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 17, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 15, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 19, 2009. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted no exhibits at the time of hearing. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on October 28, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\nthe record open until November 2, 2009, to submit additional documents. He timely\n\n2\nsubmitted additional documents, which have been identified and entered into evidence\ncollectively as Exhibit A. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations: 1.a., b., c., e., g., and h. He\ndenied: 1.d. and f. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 48 years old. He is currently married and has two children. He has\nreceived a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering. He served in the\nUnited States Navy from 1992 to 1995, when he received an Honorable Discharge. At\nthe time of the hearing, Applicant was employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks\na DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists eight allegations (1.a. through 1.h.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts. The debts will be discussed in the\nsame order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in\nMarch 2000, and his debts were discharged in bankruptcy in September 2000.\nApplicant testified that the reason that he had financial difficulties that caused him to file\nfor bankruptcy in 2000, included the fact that his parents were killed in a train accident,\nin 1995, which caused him some depression, and his first wife left him with a significant\namount of bills. He also left the Navy around this time, and it took him about eight\nmonths to secure additional employment. The bankruptcy discharged all of his debts\nexcept his college loans and the mortgage on one of his homes (Tr at 28-30).\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $6,375. Applicant\ntestified that he contacted this creditor in 2007, but he was not able to make a payment\narrangement. This debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 30-31).\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,534. Applicant\ntestified that he contacted this creditor, but he was not able to make a payment\narrangement. This debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 31-33).\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $34,456. Applicant\ntestified that his current wife planned to file bankruptcy to resolve this credit card debt.\nHowever, upon questioning, Applicant conceded that this debt was incurred while he\nand his current wife were married, so Applicant is also responsible for this debt. At this\ntime, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 33-34).\n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $111,000.  Applicant\ntestified that this debt is for a home equity line of credit for his current home. While he\nhas been attempting to renegotiate a payment plan for this debt, he has not yet done\nso, and he estimated that he has not made on a payment on this debt for the last\neighteen months to two years. At this time, this debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at\n34-37).\n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $31,465.  Applicant\ntestified that he contacted this creditor for this credit card debt, but he was not able to\nmake a payment arrangement. This debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 37).\n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $23,336.  Applicant\ntestified that this credit card debt has not been paid or reduced (Tr at 37-38).\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $120,000. This debt,\nfor income property that was ultimately lost in foreclosure, is still owed (Tr at 39-41). \nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties occurred when he worked for a\ncompany on a speculation basis, where he did not receive an income, in the hope that\neventually there would be a significant payout. However, the business did not pan out.\nAdditionally, when his wife became pregnant, she stopped working so they lost that\nincome. Finally, the home he purchased on speculation also was not successful, and it\nwas eventually repossessed, as reviewed in 1.f., above (Tr at 41-44). \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted three positive character letters in Exhibit A. One letter was\nfrom his supervisor, dated October 30, 2009, which stated that Applicant \u201chas always\nbeen diligent in doing the right thing for the United States Air Force.\u201d One of the other\nletters was from a Lieutenant Colonel in United States Air Force. It stated that\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cpatriotism and his sense of right versus wrong are evident in his persona.\nThough it may take him some time to correct his financial situation, I am convinced that\nhe is committed to doing just that, by steady diligent work.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has\nbeen unable to pay all of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant testified  that his financial problems resulted from a lack of income because\nhe was involved in employment without compensation, and his wife stopped working\nwhen she became pregnant.  However, he also made an unfortunate business choice\nwhen  he purchased investment property. Also, since he has not repaid or resolved any\nof his considerable overdue debt, I cannot find that he has acted responsibly.\nTherefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n Applicant has not resolved any of his overdue debt. I conclude that until he is\nable to significantly reduce this overdue debt, he has not mitigated the financial\nconcerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n    \n\n6\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition\napplies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns set forth in the SOR. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 1, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On March 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nNovember 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn April 8, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on June 24, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without \nobjection.2 DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the 19 factual allegations under SOR \u00b6 1. She denied the \nthree allegations under SOR \u00b6 2. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact.

When the contract ended, she \nwas hired by the government agency pending adjudication of her security clearance. \nShe worked for the agency until March 2009, when the SOR was issued. Applicant \ntestified her government employer would hire her back if she receives access to \nclassified information. Since March 2009, she has worked part-time approximately 10 \nhours a week, with a salary of $10.00 an hour (Tr. 65-71).   \n \n \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, \n2006.  \n \n2  AE 7 was admitted post-hearing. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn March 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and had her \ndebts discharged. While in college she abused her credit cards and had a lot of debt \nshe could not afford to pay. Additionally, she was involved in a car accident and totaled \nthe car her mother gave her. In 2005, she wanted to purchase a home and was advised \nto file for bankruptcy protection to repair her credit and start anew. Applicant \nparticipated in financial counseling when she was going through the bankruptcy (Tr. 72-\n73). \n \nDuring the bankruptcy case, Applicant learned her student loans were not \ndischargeable. From 2004 to 2008, Applicant paid her student loans sporadically. In \nJanuary 2008, she started a payment plan with the creditor and made payments of $479 \na month up to March 2009. Because she is now working part-time, the payments were \nreduced to $263. She is making her payments using her unemployment benefits and \nher part-time job earnings. She anticipated being out of default by September 2009. \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was working part-time at a hospital. In October 2007, she was \nconverted to a full-time employee and signed up for medical insurance. She claimed \nthat, she did not then know she was pregnant, and failed to disclose her pregnancy to \nher insurer. Through out the year, she incurred numerous medical bills related to her \npregnancy. The insurance company denied her claims for reimbursement because it \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s pregnancy as a pre existing condition that she was required to \ndisclose. All of the alleged medical bills in the SOR are from this period and related to \nher pregnancy (Tr. 74). \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant became aware of the denial of her medical claims. \nShe started participating in a debt consolidation program to resolve her debts (Tr. 59). \nSince November 2007, she has been consistently making her payments to pay the \ncompany\u2019s fee. The company has been taking her money, but has failed to settle or pay \nany of her debts (Tr. 86-87). Applicant claimed she did not know the debt consolidation \ncompany was not making the payments until she started gathering information for her \nsecurity clearance hearing. \n \nApplicant married her husband in April 2007, and they have a two-year-old child \n(Tr. 29). Applicant\u2019s spouse was unemployed or underemployed while Applicant was \npregnant, and they did not have medical insurance. He started working for a \ngovernment agency in October 2008, and earns around $2,600 a month. Applicant and \nher spouse share the responsibility of paying the household debts. \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to four main causes: her husband\u2019s \nperiods of unemployment and underemployment; her periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment; the medical bills she acquired as a result of her pregnancy; and not \nhaving medical insurance (Tr. 60). Because of her limited income, she could not afford \nto pay both her past financial obligations and her day-to-day living expenses.  \n \nParagraph 2 of the SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose in \nher October 2008 security clearance application that she filed for bankruptcy in March \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2005, that she had debts over 180 days delinquent during the last seven years, and that \nshe was currently 90 days delinquent on her debts.  \n \nConcerning her failure to disclose her bankruptcy, Applicant credibly explained \nthat in 2007 she submitted her first ever security clearance application to another \nagency. In her 2007 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that she had \nfiled for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection (AE 7). In 2008, she was asked to update her \n2007 security clearance application and resubmit it. She believed that all the information \nshe submitted in 2007, was already in possession of the government. Thus, she \nindicated \u201cNo\u201d in 2008, to show she had not filed for a Chapter 13 proceeding.   \n \nConcerning her failure to disclose she had debts over 180 days delinquent, and \nthat she was currently 90 days delinquent on her debts, Applicant explained that, when \nshe submitted her October 2008 security clearance application, she had been \nparticipating on her debt consolidation program since November 2007 (Tr. 55). She \nmistakenly believed that the debt consolidation company was already settling her debts \nand making payments for her. She made the mistake of believing that she was no \nlonger delinquent on any debts because the debts were being addressed through the \ndebt consolidation program. \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $62,000, which have been delinquent for a number of years. Except for \nSOR \u00b6 1.n (alleging an $858 bank debt, which Applicant believes concerns a student \nloan) and SOR \u00b6 1.m (alleging $47,000 delinquent student loans), all 16 remaining \nallegations concern Applicant\u2019s medical debts. All her medical debts were incurred at \nthe same hospital as a result of Applicant\u2019s pregnancy between 2006 and 2007. At the \ntime, she and her spouse were underemployed or unemployed and did not have \nmedical insurance.  \n \nAlthough unemployed and/or underemployed, Applicant has saved $800 to pay \nher delinquent debts. She used last year\u2019s tax refund, earnings from her part-time job, \nand her unemployment benefits to accumulate the $800. She promised to settle and \npay all of her debts in the near future. Applicant expressed remorse for her financial \nproblems.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent and/or charged off debts that have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. These debts are Applicant\u2019s debts as established by \nthe evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions. She acquired these debts after she was \ndischarged of all her delinquent debts through a 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., her and her spouse\u2019s periods of unemployment and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunderemployment; lack of medical insurance coverage; and the medical expenses \nassociated with her pregnancy and delivery of her child. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.  \n \n \nExcept for the delinquent student loans that Applicant has been carrying since \n2001 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.n), all of Applicant\u2019s current delinquent debts are for medical \nexpenses she incurred at one hospital as a result of her pregnancy. She credibly \nexplained she believed her medical debts were covered by her insurance. However, her \ncoverage was denied because the insurance company considered her pregnancy a \npreexisting condition.  \n \n \nApplicant has not used any credit cards since her 2005 bankruptcy discharge \nand there is no evidence she has abused her credit. She appears to be living a \nfinancially responsible lifestyle. As soon as she was informed that the insurance \ncompany was denying coverage in November 2007, Applicant started participating in a \ndebt consolidation program. She has been regularly paying the fees for the debt \nconsolidation program.  \n \n \nApplicant sporadically paid her student loans from 2006 to 2008. In 2008, she \ncontacted her creditors and started making routine monthly payments. She has \ncontinued to do so notwithstanding her part-time employment. She anticipates her \nstudent loans will be out of default in the near future. She has been using her \nunemployment benefits, part-time job income, and tax refunds to pay for her student \nloans. She has saved approximately $800 to pay for her delinquent debts after the debt \nconsolidation company settles some of the accounts.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions are sufficient to show some responsibility under the \ncircumstances. She presented documentary evidence of debt payments, participation in \na debt consolidation program, financial counseling, and contacts with creditors. \nApplicant and her husband seem to be living a financially responsible lifestyle. I believe \nthat when Applicant starts her full-time job, she and her husband will have their financial \nproblems under control.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing; \nhowever, they occurred under circumstances that are not likely to recur. Her behavior \naddressing her financial problems so far speak well for her reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c) and (d) apply. She received financial counseling and she is \nmaking efforts to resolve her financial problems. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (e) and (f) do not apply.  \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s actions show a concerned effort \nto correct her financial problems, demonstrate maturity, and financial responsibility. \nFinancial considerations concerns are mitigated.4  \n                                            \n4  Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation, and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context \nto pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose in her October 2008 security clearance application \nthat she filed for bankruptcy in March 2005, that she had debts over 180 days \ndelinquent during the last seven years, and that she was currently 90 days delinquent \non some of her debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2007 security clearance application to another agency shows that she \ndisclosed that she had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection (AE 7). When she \nupdated the 2007 application to submit it in 2008, she believed that all the information \nshe submitted in 2007, was already in possession of the government. Thus, she \nindicated \u201cNo\u201d in 2008, to show she had not filed for a Chapter 13 proceeding. Having \nlistened to Applicant and observed her demeanor, I believe Applicant made an honest \nmistake as a result of her lack of familiarity with the security clearance process.  \n \nConcerning her failure to disclose she had debts over 180 days delinquent, and \nthat she was currently 90 days delinquent on her debts, Applicant credibly explained \nthat, she mistakenly believed that the debt consolidation company was already settling \nher debts and making payments for her. She made the mistake of believing that she \nwas no longer delinquent on any debts because the debts were being addressed \nthrough the debt consolidation program. I find Applicant\u2019s omissions were not with the \nintent to falsify or mislead the government. As such, Applicant\u2019s actions do not create \nsecurity concerns under the personal conduct guideline.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is \nconditional.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is attempting to correct her \nfinancial situation by participating in financial counseling, contacting her creditors, \nparticipating in a debt consolidation program, making a budget, and living a financially \nresponsible lifestyle since 2005. She successfully worked for a defense contractor and a \ngovernment agency for approximately 20 months. There is no evidence she has ever \ncompromised classified information or committed any security violations. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for her financial mistakes and promised to repay her creditors. She \nestablished circumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her \ndebts. These factors show responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005 because she \nhad abused her credit cards. She now has approximately 16 delinquent medical bills \nresulting form her lack of medical insurance.  \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant presented sufficient evidence to show she is \nbehaving responsibly and making progress in resolving her financial problems. She \npresented documentary evidence of efforts to pay her financial obligations or to resolve \nher debts. There are indications that her financial problems are being resolved. Her \nability to pay her student loans, the debt consolidation company, and saving $800 to \npay creditors, show she is making good-faith efforts to resolve her situation. Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nfinancial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on March 25, 2009. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 2, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing, which DOHA received on April 30, 2009. He requested a hearing before\nSeptember 23, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd.

DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 29, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 22, 2009.\nThe government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He\nsubmitted one exhibit (AE) A, which was received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 30, 2009. I held the\nrecord open until August 14, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  Applicant\ndid not submit any additional evidence. The record closed on August 14, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on July 8, 2009. (Tr. 8.) I advised Applicant\nof his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing.\nApplicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.c-1.f, 1.h, 1.l-1.u, and 1.w of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g,\n1.i-1.k, and 1.v of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to support his\n1\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 42 years old, works as a rigger for a Department of Defense\ncontractor. He has held this position since September 2007.2\nApplicant started working at age 15. He graduated from high school and married\nin 1997. He and his wife have a son, who is four years old. He has a son, age 26, and a\ndaughter, age 23, from other relationships. His grown children do not depend upon him\nfinancially. However, he continued to pay the mother of his older son for child support\narrearages at the rate of $55 a week, which is deducted from his pay. He anticipated\nthat the remaining $2,000 balance on his debt will be paid in full in less than one year.3\n\nGE 6; Tr. 22.\n4\nGE 1; Tr. 22-24.\n5\nTr. 24-28, 42.\n6\nId. 29-30.\n7\n3\nIn October 2001, Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.\nThe bankruptcy trustee determined that they should pay $143 bi-weekly on their debts,\nwhich they did for several months. Their bankruptcy payments stopped when Applicant\ndeveloped new financial issues. The court dismissed his bankruptcy case on September\n26, 2002.4\nApplicant worked as a truck driver for many years. He drove a truck for a food\nservice company from November 1999 until May 2002. He next drove a truck for a\nfurniture company from some months until his job ended with his lay off. For the next\nyear, he drove a truck for another food service company. He then  began working in\nproduce for a large national company. About one year later, he obtained another truck\ndriving job and reduced his produce job to part-time. He worked in this truck driver\nposition until he injured his back in 2004.  \n5\nWhile working, Applicant sustained a significant back injury. Initially, doctors\ntreated his injury conservatively with medicine, including expensive injections. Applicant\nunderwent back surgery in August 2005. Worker\u2019s compensation initially denied him\nbenefits, resulting in a six-month loss of income. He eventually received his worker\u2019s\ncompensation benefits and settled his worker\u2019s compensation case for $12,000. As a\nconsequence of his injury, Applicant did not work for one year and had no income for six\nmonths after his injury in 2004. When he could not return to work, his employer\ncancelled his health insurance coverage. Although his wife worked in a hospital at the\ntime of his injury, her income did not pay all the household bills. Applicant used his\nworker\u2019s compensation settlement to pay his attorney\u2019s fees and other bills.6\nWhen he returned to work in late 2005, Applicant initially worked through a\ntemporary agency for truck drivers. After two months, he obtained another full-time truck\ndriver position. This job lasted eight months and ended when his employer decided to\nclose its operations in the east. The company offered him a position in its western\noperations, but Applicant decided not to move his family West.7\nApplicant secured another truck driver position in 2006, which lasted until\nJanuary 2007. While employed, he drove his personal car one day after consuming\nalcohol. The police stopped him and conducted a breathalyzer test. He registered .05\nor.06, which is not over the legal limit for a driver\u2019s license, but is above the commercial\ndriver limit of .04. His commercial and personal driving licenses were suspended for one\n\nId. 30-32.\n8\nAE A; Tr. 109, 22, 54-55.\n9\nTr. 57-62.\n10\nAE A; Tr. 32-34, 64, 66.\n11\n4\nyear. His driver\u2019s licenses have been returned to him. During this time, he worked at\nanother position, earning $8 an hour. He left this job for his current position.8\nFor a 40-hour work week, Applicant earns $609 in gross income. He began\nearning significant overtime in April 2009. With his overtime earnings, Applicant has\ndoubled his 2009 yearly earnings through the pay period ending on July 12, 2009. His\nleave and earnings statement for the pay period ending July 12, 2009 showed his net\npay as $964. His wife works six hours a day in home health care, earning $7.14 an\nhour. Her gross income for a 30-hour week is $214.9\nApplicant\u2019s monthly expenses include $525 for rent, $113 for water, $85 for\nelectric, $45 for gas in the summer and $140 for gas in the winter, $120 for cell phones,\n$300 for gasoline, and $147 for car insurance. He estimated $200 a month in food for\nthree people, which is low. I find that $300 a month for food is reasonable. He did not\nestimate any miscellaneous expenses such as hair cuts, car repairs, clothing, dry\ncleaning, medical bills, or other unanticipated expenses.  I find that his total other\nmonthly expenses to be around $150. His total monthly expenses are approximately\n$1,800. He indicated he had approximately $400 at the end of each month. Because his\nwife spends money shopping, this money pays for her shopping bills. He owns a 1998\ncar and a 2001 car, which have no liens encumbering them.10\n \nApplicant contacted the creditor holding the judgment in allegation 1.a about a\nrepayment plan in December 2008 or January 2009. He learned that the creditor had\nstarted garnishment proceedings against him. He agreed to the garnishment. Since the\ngarnishment began in January 2009, Applicant has paid $4,113 on the judgment based\non his leave and earnings statement. He anticipated that the judgment debt will be paid\nin full by October 2009, as his pay is usually garnished at the rate of 25%.11\nApplicant has not paid any of the remaining bills listed in the SOR. He disagreed\nor denied the debts listed in SOR allegations 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.v. He paid his\nbill with the creditor in 1.b before he moved. He has no idea why he is being charged an\nadditional $265. He does not recognize the creditor listed in allegation 1.v. and, in light\nof his denial, the government has not provided sufficient evidence to show that this debt\nis his. He believed that his medical insurance should have paid the debts listed in\nallegations 1.j and 1.k, as these medical bills are for the injections to his injured back.\nHe did not provide evidence that these bills were covered by insurance. At the hearing,\n\nResponse to SOR; Tr. 26-27, 34-41, 43-46. \n12\n5\nhe acknowledged that the debt in 1.g is probably related to an early cancellation fee for\na cell phone, which did not work when he moved.12\nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s unpaid bills arose from medical care. With the\nexception of the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.u, all his unpaid debts occurred between\nApril 2003 and January 2007. Three debts became delinquent in December 2006 (1.f,\n1.h, 1.s) and one debt became delinquent in January 2007 (1.i).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\n\nHis delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR\n13\nCase No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. BD. Aug. 29, 2008)(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. BD. Oct. 16, 2002)).\n6\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt, which he has been unable to\npay for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ While\nApplicant=s financial worries arose between 2003 and 2006, his debt did not arise from\ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur.   Thus, this mitigating condition does not\n13\napply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\n\nAG \u00b6 20(f) is not raised in this case.\n14\n7\nproblems became unmanageable when he injured his back in 2004 and had no income\nfor six months. Following his return to work in the fall of 2005, he worked, but not\nsteadily and at times for low wages. When he settled his worker\u2019s compensation case,\nhe used the settlement proceeds to pay old bills, but he did not pay all his overdue bills.\nHe acted responsibly in identifying and resolving some of his debts. I find this mitigating\ncondition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not obtained financial\ncounseling. There are no clear indications that the problem is under control. This\nmitigating condition is not applicable.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ncontacted the creditor who obtained the judgment against him with the intent to develop\na repayment plan. The creditor had already initiated garnishment proceedings, so\nApplicant agreed to repay this debt through garnishment. He continues to pay his past-\ndue child support. However, the majority of his SOR debts are not resolved, and\nApplicant did not disclose a practical plan to resolve most SOR debts. This mitigating\ncondition is partially applicable.\nFinally, AG \u00b6 20 (e) applies when \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence\nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant denies several debts, but has not provided\ndocumentary proof that he challenged the validity of these debts. Thus, this mitigating\ncondition is not applicable.14\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nand his wife tried to gain control over their finances by filing for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\nin 2001, the wage earners plan. They agreed to the monthly payment plan, and\ncomplied with it plan for a short period of time. Their payments stopped, and the court\ndismissed their case. Applicant\u2019s finances continued to be problematic because his\nincome fluctuated and he lost work and income when he inured his back. He did not\nhave steady and reliable employment until two years ago. For the last three years, he\nand his wife have paid their usual monthly bills in a timely manner. They have not,\nhowever, made a strong effort to resolve their unpaid bills, several of which are less\nthan $100. Applicant faithfully pays his back child support and agreed to the\ngarnishment of his salary to pay the judgment against him. With his overtime, he is\nearning more money, but has not applied any of this extra money to resolve his many\nsmall debts. While he manages his current finances well, Applicant needs more time to\norganize his finances and resolve his other debts.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On July 22, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\n\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On January 20, 2010, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Marc E. Curry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge substituted a\nfavorable credibility determination for record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant is an employee of a Defense contractor.  She had one\ndelinquent debt as of the date of the SOR, a credit card account with a balance of approximately\n$14,000.  Applicant has since settled the sole debt cited in the SOR by paying the creditor $3,500.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s arguments  focus on the Judge\u2019s findings regarding the history of the\nnow settled debt.  Department Counsel makes some important points, for example a credibility\ndetermination based on the written record is not entitled to the same deference on appeal as a\ncredibility determination based on observation of a witness\u2019s demeanor.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n04-12680 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2007).  Also, Applicant\u2019s failure to monitor her mother\u2019s use of\nher credit card and to address delinquencies promptly provide evidence of questionable judgment.\nHowever, not all the Judge\u2019s  findings were challenged.  The findings described above were\nunchallenged.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant satisfied the debt, has ample\ndiscretionary income to manage her finances and there is no record evidence indicating any other\nfinancial problems were not challenged on appeal.  These findings and conclusions are sufficient to\nsupport the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision.  Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is sustainable.  \u201cThe Board need not agree with a Judge\u2019s decision in order to find it\nsustainable.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 06-23881 at 2 (App. Bd.

Furthermore, it is well-settled\nthat  a  party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

In 2003, Applicant opened a department store credit card, and allowed her mother to use it (Item 5 at 26). Between 2003 and 2005, her mother charged thousands of dollars to the credit card and made no payments (Item 5 at 4). By 2008, the delinquent account balance had accrued to approximately $14,000 (Item 5 at 26). In April 2009, the creditor wrote Applicant with a settlement proposal under which it would close the account provided Applicant paid $2,910 (Item 5 at 11). Applicant provided a copy of the creditor\u2019s letter to the government in response to interrogatories propounded in May 2009 (Item 5). Approximately three months elapsed and Applicant still had not responded to the settlement offer, prompting the government to issue the SOR. Approximately six weeks later, Applicant paid the creditor $3500 (Response to FORM at 4). On October 16, 2009, the creditor wrote Applicant confirming that she had settled the account (Response to FORM at 4).",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the government\u2019s Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nsecurity concern. Clearance is granted.\nOn July 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a security concern under Guideline\nF stemming from one unpaid debt. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn August 14, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the SOR allegation,\nand requesting an administrative determination. On September 10, 2009, Department\nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), and DOHA mailed it to\nApplicant. She received it on September 11, 2009, along with instructions to file any\nJanuary 20, 2010\n\n2\nobjections or supplementary information within 30 days. She responded on October 19,\n2009, and the case was assigned to me on November 3, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old woman with one child, age 16. She has been\nseparated from her husband for the past eight years (Item 1 at 29). Applicant served in\nthe United States Army from 1992 through 2000. Her discharge was honorable (Item 1\nat 32). \nIn 2003, Applicant enrolled in college. She earned a degree in 2007 (Item 1 at\n13). The nature of the degree is unknown from the record. Since graduating from\ncollege, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as an engineer (Id.). Currently,\nshe is a lead engineer (Id.).\nIn 2003, Applicant opened a department store credit card, and allowed her\nmother to use it (Item 5 at 26). Between 2003 and 2005, her mother charged thousands\nof dollars to the credit card and made no payments (Item 5 at 4). By 2008, the\ndelinquent account balance had accrued to approximately $14,000 (Item 5 at 26).\nIn April 2009, the creditor wrote Applicant with a settlement proposal under which\nit would close the account provided Applicant paid $2,910 (Item 5 at 11). Applicant\nprovided a copy of the creditor\u2019s letter to the government in response to interrogatories\npropounded in May 2009 (Item 5). Approximately three months elapsed and Applicant\nstill had not responded to the settlement offer, prompting the government to issue the\nSOR. Approximately six weeks later, Applicant paid the creditor $3500 (Response to\nFORM at 4). On October 16, 2009, the creditor wrote Applicant confirming that she had\nsettled the account (Response to FORM at 4).\nApplicant maintains a budget (Item 5 at 10). She has $589 of monthly, after-\nexpense income (Id.). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(c)). In making a\ndecision, the administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about\nthe person.\n\n3\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 18). \nAs of the date of the SOR, Applicant had a credit card account for approximately\n$14,000 that had been delinquent since 2006. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \nApplicant\u2019s mother accrued the credit card charges. In September 2009,\nApplicant settled the account, and one month later, the creditor confirmed the account\nsettlement. Applicant maintains a budget and has ample discretionary income to\nmanage her finances. The following mitigating guidelines apply:\nAG \u00b6 20(b) - the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nand,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) - the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n4\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nRegardless of whether Applicant accrued the delinquency, she had a\nresponsibility to make efforts to resolve it. Instead she waited nearly six months to follow\nthrough on the creditor\u2019s settlement offer. Nevertheless, Applicant satisfied the account\nand has ample discretionary income to manage her finances. Also, there is no record\nevidence indicating any other financial problems. Upon evaluating this case in the\ncontext of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial\nConsiderations security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On October 29, 2009,\nafter considering the record, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge considered all of the\nrecord evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the mitigating conditions; and whether\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding\nno error, we affirm. \nThe Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts.  Applicant denied some of\nthe debts and submitted a decree of divorce from his ex-wife.  However, the Judge stated that\nApplicant had not provided evidence to demonstrate that his financial problems were connected to\nthe divorce.  The Judge also observed that Applicant provided no evidence as to why he has not used\nhis after-expenses income to pay off debts.  On the security clearance application (SCA), Applicant\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to a question inquiring about debts delinquent more than 180 days.  This answer was\nnot true, in view of the fact that several of the debts alleged in the SOR were within the scope of the\nquestion and, therefore, required an affirmative answer.   The Judge concluded that Applicant had\n1\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his debts and from his false answer to the SCA\nquestion.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider favorable evidence, such as his divorce\nand the fact that he has held a top secret clearance for twelve years.  A Judge is presumed to have\nconsidered all the evidence in the record, and Applicant\u2019s submission on appeal is not sufficient to\nrebut that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR\nCase No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  Applicant contends that his debts over 180 days\nwere ones which had been incurred by his ex-wife in his name during the course of the marriage.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal submission does not demonstrate that this contention, even if true, would mitigate\nthe security concerns in his case, especially the one arising from his false answer to the SCA.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, on May 27, 2009 (Item 3).\nHe requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n2\nOn June 11, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on August 5, 2009. Applicant\ndid not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on September 9, 2009.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Items 1-\n7). No documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR (Item 3) Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., and 1.c. through\n1.f., and he denied 1.b., 1.g., and 1.h., under Guideline F. He also admitted 2.a., under\nGuideline E. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 34 years old. He works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDepartment of Defense security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F- Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists eight allegations (1.a. through 1.h.) regarding overdue debts under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $14,653. As stated\nabove, Applicant admitted this debt in his RSOR (Item 3), and no evidence has been\nintroduced to establish that this debt has been resolved. I find that this debt has not\nbeen paid. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,209. Applicant\ndenied this debt in his RSOR (Item 3), stating that this debt was for a vehicle belonging\nto his ex-wife in his divorce decree. In his response to interrogatories (Item 7), Applicant\nstated that this debt is the same as 1.a., above. In reviewing the credit reports submitted\nby the Government (Items 5 and 6), I find there are different collection account numbers\nand significantly different amounts owed for these two debts, and the report indicated\nthat one debt was for an auto loan, while the other debt did not identify the type of loan.\nTherefore, I cannot conclude that this debt is the same as 1.a., above. I find that no\nevidence has been introduced to establish that this debt has been paid. \n\n3\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,548. Applicant\nadmitted this debt in his RSOR (Item 3), and no evidence has been introduced to\nestablish that this debt has been resolved. I find that this debt has not been paid. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $379. Applicant\nadmitted this debt in his RSOR (Item 3), and no evidence has been introduced to\nestablish that this debt has been resolved. I find that this debt has not been paid. \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,868. Applicant\nadmitted this debt in his RSOR (Item 3), and no evidence has been introduced to\nestablish that this debt has been resolved. I find that this debt has not been paid. \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,830. Applicant\nadmitted this debt in his RSOR (Item 3), and no evidence has been introduced to\nestablish that this debt has been resolved. I find that this debt has not been paid. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $13,368. Applicant\ndenied this debt in his RSOR (Item 3). In his response to interrogatories (Item 7),\nApplicant stated that this debt is the same as 1.a., above. In reviewing the credit reports\nsubmitted by the Government (Items 5 and 6), I find these two debts are both identified\nas auto loans and the amounts owed for these two debts are reasonably close, so I\nconclude that this debt is the same as 1.a., above and it is only owed once. \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $538. Applicant\ndenied this debt in his RSOR (Item 3). In his response to interrogatories (Item 7),\nApplicant stated that he did \u201cnot know what this debt is.\u201d  In reviewing the credit report\n(Item 5), there is a notation beside this debt that states \u201cconsumer says acct not his.\u201d I\nfind that Applicant has made a good faith effort to dispute this debt.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on July 19, 2009 (Item 4). Question 28.a.\nasks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The Government\nalleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as 1.a.\nthrough1.d., and 1.f. through 1.h., above. There is no dispute that these debts were all\nlong overdue and were still owing at the time Applicant completed the SCA, and they\nshould have been included in the responses to 28.a. \n Also, while it was not alleged on the SOR, Question 28.b. of the SCA asks, \u201cAre\nyou currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this\nquestion, and he listed no debts. Applicant also should have included the same debts\nas those alleged on 2.a., above. \nApplicant offered no explanation for his failure to list any of the debts that he had\nowed for a significant period of time. \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and DC 19. (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy his debts, and his long history of not meeting financial obligations.\nWhile Applicant submitted evidence of his divorce from his ex-wife on March 3,\n2006, no evidence was introduced to establish that this was the cause of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties. Additionally, Item 7 contained Applicant\u2019s Personal Financial\nStatement, dated March 16, 2009, which showed that Applicant has a net remainder of\n$1,149.91 a month. There was no explanation given by Applicant as to why he has not\nused any of this remainder to resolve his overdue debts. I cannot find that any Mitigating\nCondition (MC) applies as no evidence has been introduced to establish that Applicant\nhas resolved any of his overdue debts.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n       With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that he executed on July\n19, 2007. Applicant identified no debts that were over 180 days overdue in the last\nseven years prior to his completing the SCA, nor any current debts that were over 90\ndays overdue, when clearly he should have identified the debts listed on the SOR.\nApplicant gave no explanation for his failure to put the Government on notice that he\nhad financial difficulties.\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to the Government, it is extremely difficult to\nconclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an\nindividual given a clearance. In this case, based on Applicant\u2019s overall history, my\ninability to see the Applicant and judge his veracity in person, and the lack of any\nwitness to provide testimony regarding Applicant\u2019s character, I can find no reasonable\nexplanation for Applicant\u2019s failure to provide this very significant information to the\nGovernment on the SCA, and I must conclude that Applicant knowingly and willingly\nfailed to furnish honest information to the Government. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E, I conclude that \nDC16. (a) applies because Applicant deliberately provided false and misleading\ninformation to the Government in a SCA.   No Mitigating Condition applies under this\nGuideline.  As a result of the misinformation that Applicant  provided to the Government,\nhis conduct exhibits questionable judgement, unreliability, and a lack of candor. I\nresolve Guideline E against Applicant.\n\n6\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the\nGovernment's evidence opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against Applicant as to the allegations expressed in\nParagraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's SOR. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, and his willful omissions made to the\nGovernment, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole\nperson concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 18, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn August 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn September 9, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on October 15, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nOctober 23, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 8, 2009, in\nLas Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 12, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nA through U at the time of hearing, which were also admitted without objection. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 22, 2009, to submit\n\n2\nadditional documents. He timely submitted nine additional documents, which have been\nidentified and entered into evidence collectively, without objection, as Exhibit V. On\nDecember 18, 2009, Applicant requested an additional extension to submit additional\ndocuments. He timely submitted three more documents, which have been identified and\nentered into evidence collectively, without objection, as Exhibit W. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on December 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 47 years old. He is married, but he and his wife separated in\nNovember 2006, and they are in the process of getting divorced. (Tr at 53.) They have\none daughter. Applicant served for 27 years in the United States Air Force, and he\nretired with an Honorable Discharge. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor,\nand he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the\ndefense sector.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 3 allegations (1.a. through 1.c.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  The allegations will be discussed below in the same\norder as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,696. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was for a credit card of his wife. He was not aware of this debt\nuntil November 2009, and he thereafter paid off this debt. (Tr at 49-50.) Exhibit W\nincludes a letter from the creditor of this debt, dated December 29, 2009, indicating that\nApplicant settled this debt in the amount of $5,850. \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,342. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was incurred from an account of his wife. When she did not make\npayments, the case was taken to court, and a judgement was issued. Applicant\u2019s wife is\nnow being garnished in the amount of $85 a month to resolve this debt. (Tr at 50-53.) A\nletter from Applicant\u2019s wife confirms that she is being held solely responsible by the\ncreditor to resolve this debt, and the creditor is not pursuing the Applicant. (Exhibit M.)   \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $25,708. Applicant\ntestified that this is an account that he used to pay off some of his other debts. At the\ntime of the hearing, he had been paying $100 a month from March through November\n2009 to pay off this debt. He plans to continue making these payments until the debt is\nresolved, and he stated that the creditor is satisfied to continue collecting his payments\nuntil the debt is paid in full. (Tr at 53-54.)\n\n3\nApplicant explained that when he was deployed, his wife engaged the services of\na law firm that served as a debt consolidation company (DCC), to try to reduce their\ndebt when she lost her job. Applicant and his wife paid this dcc approximately $15,000\nor $16,000 over the period from October 2007 through November 2008. (Exhibit 7.) He\ntestified that this DCC was ultimately terminated by the Supreme Court of Florida for\nbusiness practices that were detrimental to consumers. Applicant has since received a\nrefund from the court of $9,000, which has been used to resolve another debt, not listed\non the SOR. (Tr at 54-60.)\nApplicant testified that he is still waiting for an additional $4,600 to be refunded to\nhim, and he is planning to use that to reduce the debt that is listed as 1.c. The creditor\nhas indicated that they would accept an additional $10,414 to settle this debt, and when\nApplicant\u2019s receives the $4,600, it is his plan to add $1,000 with that $4,600 for an initial\npayment of $5,700 and follow up with $1,000 a month for four months, and finally pay\nthe remainder after that. The goal is to resolve the debt by June of 2010. (Tr at 60-62.)\nDuring cross examination, Applicant conceded that he was not certain how much\nadditional money he would recover from the court. (Tr at 85-86.)\nApplicant testified that when he was deployed, off and on from February 2007\nuntil May 2008, he gave his wife his power of attorney. During that period, she\nrefinanced the loan for his automobile, taking out $10,000 in cash, and raising his\nmonthly payments for the car loan from $450 a month to $600 a month. She also lost\nher job in March 2007, and she was unemployed for three months.\nApplicant testified that his wife incurred additional debts without his knowledge,\nwhich were not listed on the SOR. As he became aware of these debts he has resolved\nthese as well. (Tr at 72-73.) \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July\n28, 2008. (Exhibit 1.) The SOR incorrectly alleges that Question 28.b. of the SCA asks,\n\u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  Question\n28.a. actually asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Question 28.b. of the SCA actually asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions 28. a. and b., and he\nlisted no debts. \nIt is further alleged in the SOR that Applicant \u201cfailed to disclose that [he] was over\n90 days delinquent on debts listed above in sub-paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) above.\u201d\nApplicant testified that he had already been signed up with the dcc for approximately six\nto eight months by the time he completed the SCA, and he believed the DCC was\npaying his bills. He stated that he also explained to the investigator for the clearance\nthat his debts were being resolved by the DCC. When he learned that the DCC was\nhaving trouble, he contacted the investigator, and told him that he was not sure what the\nstatus of his debts was. He credibly reiterated that he never intended to mislead the\n\n4\nGovernment, he simply believed the DCC was doing what he was paying them to do,\nwhich was pay off his debts. (Tr at 66-70, 108.)\nMitigation\nApplicant testified, and the evidence has established, that of the five overdue\ndebts that, unbeknownst to Applicant, were not paid by Applicant\u2019s wife, he has now\nresolved three of them. He is in the process of resolving one of the last two overdue\ndebts, with his wife paying off the other debt. (Tr at 119-121.)\nApplicant prepared a Personal Financial Statement on April 15, 2009 (Exhibit 9),\nwhich shows that he has a net monthly remainder of approximately $1,395, part of\nwhich he plans to use to resolve the overdue debts, and stay current on his more recent\ndebts. In his post hearing submissions (Exhibit W), Applicant indicated that he planned\nto start paying $200 a month on the debt listed as 1.b., even though it was the\njudgement incurred by his wife. He also planned to increase the payments on the debt\nlisted as 1.c., from $100 a month to $200 a month.  \nFinally, Applicant submitted six extremely positive character letters in Exhibits V\nand W, from individuals who have known Applicant in his employment capacity. He was\ndescribed by his current supervisor as a \u201cstellar employee . . . a person of integrity,\ngood fiscal responsibility, trustworthy and a loyal security sentry.\u201d His supervisor also\nstated that he spoke with Applicant\u2019s  prior co-workers and supervisors before hiring him\nand \u201ceach one stated that in addition to his technical competence and work ethic he was\na person of good conduct and character, very loyal to the United States.\u201d  A co-worker\nand associate for the last 10 years, and a retired Master Sergeant for the United States\nAir Force, described Applicant as \u201can intelligent, capable, and personable maintainer.\nHe is trustworthy and with out [sic] question; a great American.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\n\n6\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated three significant delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant\u2019s financial problems resulted in part from the failure of the debt\nconsolidation company to resolve or even pay down Applicant\u2019s debts, despite his\npaying the company approximately $15,000. Additionally, his wife\u2019s unemployment\ncontributed to their financial problems. Finally, unbeknownst to Applicant at the time, his\nwife failed to pay their bills for periods of time, including when he was deployed. \nI find that Applicant has acted responsibly since these debts were incurred.  First,\nhe engaged the services and paid a substantial fee to a debt consolidation company.\nAdditionally, Applicant has paid off two of his overdue debts, one that was on the SOR\n(1.a.) and one that had been resolved before the SOR was issued. He also is making\npayments on the debt listed above as 1.c. Finally, even though debt 1.b. is being\nresolved by his wife, from whom he is separated, as per the judgement, he indicated in\nhis post hearing submission that he is attempting to help his wife resolve this debt as\nwell. (Exhibit V.) Therefore, I find that this mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nI also find that AG \u00b6  20 (d) is applicable since Applicant has \u201cinitiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nApplicant is current on all of his recent debts Therefore, I conclude that Applicant\nhas mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, I find that Applicant testified credibly that he did not\nknowingly provide incorrect material information to the Government on the SCA\nregarding his overdue debts. Applicant had engaged the services of a company to\nresolve his debts, and he had paid them approximately $15,000. He had a good faith\nbelief that all of his debts were being resolved in a timely manner. Additionally, at the\ntime he completed the SCA, he was not aware that his wife had not been paying the\ndebts and had incurred additional debts. \nI do not find that any disqualifying condition applies under this guideline.  I\ntherefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply, together with the very strong\nrecommendations on his behalf, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no\nsignificant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas  mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.- 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a..:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Montalvo, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nMay 21, 2009. On September 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn October 5, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October \n25, 2009. The case was assigned to me on November 3, 2009. On December 15, 2009, \na Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for January 13, 2010. On \nJanuary 11, 2010, the Notice of Hearing was amended to indicate that the hearing was \nto be conducted via video-teleconference. The case was heard on January 13, 2010. \nThe Government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits \nMarch 9, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(Gov) 1\u20137 without objection. The Applicant testified and offered one exhibit which was \nadmitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A without objection. AE A has six tabs containing \nvarious documents. The record was held open until January 27, 2010, to allow Applicant \nto submit additional documents.  He timely submitted a three-page document that was \nadmitted as AE B. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE B is marked as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. Applicant also timely submitted a one-page document that was admitted \nas AE C. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE C is marked as HE II. The transcript \n(Tr) was received on January 19, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.h and admitted the \nremaining SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old network troubleshooter, employed with a Department \nof Defense contractor, who is applying for a security clearance. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since March 24, 2008. He works at an overseas location. From May 1, \n1996 to July 15, 2005, he served on active duty in the United States Air Force. He was \nin the satellite communications career field. He separated as a Staff Sergeant (E-5) with \nan honorable discharge. He served two combat tours while on active duty, OPERATION \nSOUTHERN WATCH in Kuwait from May 2001 to September 2001, and OPERATION \nRESTORE HOPE in Haiti in April 2004. He was granted a SECRET clearance on May \n6, 1996. His clearance became inactive on July 14, 2007. He has earned two \nassociates degrees, one in aerospace propulsions, and one in electronic systems. He is \ndivorced and has no children. (Tr at 18-21; Gov 1; AE A, Tab 5)  \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he \nencountered financial problems after he separated from active duty in July 2005. The \nSOR alleged the following delinquent accounts: a $32 debt for a insufficient funds check \nwritten to a pizza restaurant (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 7; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1); \na $176 cable television account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 5 at 7; \nGov 6 at 1; Gov 7 at 1); a $1,713 account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 6; \nGov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 1); a $4,502 account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 6; \nGov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 1)); a $31 credit union account that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.e: \nGov 6 at 2); and a $582 account to purchase a computer that was charged off. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f: Gov 2 at 12; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 2) \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $3,064 credit card account that was \ncharged off  (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 4, 11; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 2); a $993 credit card \naccount that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 5 at 7; Gov 6 at 2); a $6,838 \nmilitary exchange credit card account that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 at 11; Gov \n5 at 7; Gov 6 at 2); and a $1,000 credit card account that was placed for collection. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 5 at 7) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant separated from the Air Force he was not prepared for the \ntransition to civilian life. He initially believed that he was to be placed on medical hold \nbecause of a back injury. His separation date was earlier than he anticipated. He was \nunemployed for several months. He found full-time employment in October 2005. The \njob location was 100 miles away from where he lived. He owned a house which he was \nunable to rent out until late January 2006. He got behind on his bills during this time \nbecause he was responsible for a mortgage payment and rent. (Tr at 21-23)  \n \nWhen he separated from the Air Force, Applicant\u2019s annual income was $28,000 a \nyear. His take home pay was about $2,000 a month.  He earned $43,000 in his first post \nAir Force employment. His take home pay remained the same. His monthly take home \npay in his current job is approximately $9,200. With the significant pay increase, he was \nable to start resolving his delinquent debts. He has no outstanding debts at this time. (Tr \nat 23-30) He sold the home he owned in January 2007. (Tr at 40) \n \nThe current status of the delinquent accounts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, $32 insufficient funds check, pizza company: Applicant made several \nattempts to contact this creditor. He was not aware of this debt and claims it is no longer \non this credit report. He will pay it if it is a legitimate debt. The debt is unresolved but of \na minimal amount. (Tr at 34-35; AE C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, $176 cable television account: Debt was paid on December 21, 2009.  \n(AE A, Tab 4 at 1)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, $1,713 account placed for collection: The account was settled in full \nin December 2009. (Tr at 33; Gov 7 at 2;  AE A, Tab 3 at 6; AE A, Tab 4 at 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d, $4,502 account placed for collection: The account was settled. (Gov \n7 at 2; AE A, Tab 3 at 5) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, $31 credit union account: Applicant disputed this account and it has \nbeen removed from his credit report. The account is resolved. (Tr at 35-36; AE A, Tab 3; \nAE B at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, $582 charged off computer account: The account was settled. (Gov 7 \nat 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, $3,064: Account was paid in full on September 25, 2009. (AE A, Tab \n3 at 6; AE A, Tab 4 at 2) The account is the same as SOR \u00b6 1.d. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, $993 charged off bank account: Account was paid. (AE A, Tab 3 at 5; \nAE B at 3)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, $6,838 charged off military exchange credit card: Applicant made \npayments on this account until it was paid in full in July 2009. (Gov 5 at 4; Gov 7 at 2; \nAE A, Tab 3 at 6; AE B at 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j, $1,000 credit card account placed for collection. The debt is paid. (AE \nA, Tab 3 at 11; AE A, Tab 4 at 3) \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted an updated personal financial worksheet. \nHis net monthly income is $9,719. This figure includes a $225 monthly disability \npayment from the Veteran\u2019s Administration. His total monthly expenses are $5,490. He \nhas approximately $4,284 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 39-40; AE B, \nNote: The net remainder figure on Applicant\u2019s personal financial worksheet is incorrect.) \nHe currently has no delinquent accounts. He is current on federal and state income \ntaxes. (Tr at 24, 39) Department Counsel conceded Applicant\u2019s debts are resolved. (Tr \nat 37)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor states that Applicant has worked for him for a year and a \nhalf.  He describes Applicant\u2019s character as stable and reliable. He comes to work on \ntime and completes assigned duties and responsibilities above expectations and in a \ntimely manner. Applicant is trusted by his teammates because of his work ethic and his \nability to pull his weight. The supervisor believes Applicant can be trusted to protect \nUnited States classified material. (AE A, Tab 2 at 1)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker has worked with him since May 2008. He also socializes \nwith Applicant outside of work. He states that Applicant has always conducted himself \nwith a high degree of character in all situations. The co-worker states Applicant is a \ndependable co-worker and does his fair share of the work load.  The co-worker states \nApplicant is trustworthy and is capable of being entrusted with sensitive information. (AE \nA, Tab 2 at 2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant encountered financial \n\n \n6 \n \n \nproblems during the first few years after he separated from the military. The SOR \nalleged 10 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $18,931.   \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems occurred when he separated from the Air Force. He did not anticipate \nhis early separation because he believed that he would be placed on medical hold. He \nwas unemployed for a few months. When he found a job, it was 100 miles away and he \nwas paying a mortgage at his former location and rent at his new job location.  When he \nfound his current position, he received a substantial pay increase and was able to \nresolve his delinquent accounts. He has paid off all of his delinquent accounts with the \nexception of the $32 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His financial situation is stable. His past \nfinancial struggles do not raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies because Applicant was unemployed \nfor several months after separating from active duty. As a result he began to incur \ndelinquent debts. Once he found a job, it was located 100 miles away. Applicant found \nhimself paying a mortgage and rent for several months which added an additional \nfinancial burden.  He acted responsibly under the circumstances. Once he was able to \nresolve the debts, Applicant systematically resolved his delinquent accounts.   \n   \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. Applicant resolved all of his delinquent debts with the exception of a \n$32 debt resulting from an insufficient funds check. Applicant demonstrated that he took \nsteps to resolve this account but could not locate the owner of the account. All of his \ndebts are current. His income has increased significantly in his current job. His financial \nsituation is under control.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant has resolved all of his accounts \nwith the exception of one minor account which he attempted to resolve but was \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunsuccessful in locating the owner of the debt. He is capable of paying the $32 debt if \nthe owner of the debt is located in the future. As soon as he was able, Applicant began \nto pay the delinquent accounts that he incurred in his first few years after separating \nfrom the military.  He initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant disputed this debt and it was \nremoved from his credit report.  \n \nApplicant mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and his honorable discharge from the military. I considered the favorable \ncomments of Applicant\u2019s supervisor and co-worker.  Applicant faced difficulties when he \ntransitioned from active duty to civilian life. His discharge date came sooner than he \nexpected. He did not have a job when he separated from the Air Force. After several \nmonths of unemployment, he found a job that was located 100 miles away and found \nhimself responsible for a mortgage and a rent payment. He was able to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts when he accepted his current position in an overseas location. He \nhas resolved all delinquent accounts with the exception of a $32 account which he will \npay if he is able to locate the current owner of the debt. Applicant has demonstrated that \nhe is reliable. His current financial situation is stable. He mitigated the concerns raised \nunder financial considerations.   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted these allegations and provided a lengthy explanation of her financial history and current financial condition. In addition to the facts entered in the record through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old mechanical engineer, who has held her current job as a structural analyst since September 2007. She and her husband have been married since October 1998 and they have five children. (FORM, Item 5) After they married, they moved to where Applicant was raised, because they thought it would be a good place to raise children. Unfortunately, there were few job opportunities for them, and what work they could find did not pay them near what they had earned before the move. At the time they got married, Applicant and her husband earned in excess of $72,000 annually. After they moved, their income dropped to about $21,000.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is granted.\nOn October 10, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for her job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent\ninterrogatories to Applicant to obtain clarification of and/or additional information about\nadverse information in her background.  Based on the results of the background\n1\ninvestigation, including Applicant\u2019s response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators\nNovember 27, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n4\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On June\n17, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts\nwhich raise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)3\nunder Guideline F (financial considerations).\nOn July 9, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On July 22, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n4\nreceived the FORM on August 20, 2009, and was given 30 days to file a response to\nthe FORM. She did not timely respond to the FORM by the September 19, 2009,\ndeadline. The case was assigned to me on November 10, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $61,900 for two\ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. In response to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted these allegations and provided a lengthy explanation of her financial history\nand current financial condition. In addition to the facts entered in the record through\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old mechanical engineer, who has held her current job as\na structural analyst since September 2007. She and her husband have been married\nsince October 1998 and they have five children. (FORM, Item 5) After they married,\nthey moved to where Applicant was raised, because they thought it would be a good\nplace to raise children. Unfortunately, there were few job opportunities for them, and\nwhat work they could find did not pay them near what they had earned before the move.\nAt the time they got married, Applicant and her husband earned in excess of $72,000\nannually. After they moved, their income dropped to about $21,000. (FORM, Item 6)\nApplicant and her husband struggled to make ends meet between 1998 and\n2003, as she stayed at home to care for their children and worked occasional part-time\njobs. In 2003, they considered moving to an area with more job opportunities, but when\nhis salary increased to about $35,000, they decided to stay. However, they were never\nable to get ahead. In December 2005, her husband\u2019s pay as a financial planner\nconverted from salary plus a commission to just commission. For the next 22 months,\nthey made a total of $45,705, for an average monthly income of about $2,077. However,\ntheir income was uneven in that in 13 of those months, their income was less than\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n3\n$1,500. Between October 2007 (just after Applicant began her current job) and\nFebruary 2008, Applicant\u2019s husband earned a total of about $1,680. Thereafter, he\nreverted to a straight salary job. Between February 2008 and May 2009, he earned\nabout $36,687, for a more consistent monthly average salary of about $2,293. (FORM,\nItem 6) \nTo meet expenses and pay bills, Applicant and her husband used credit cards\nand other forms of personal credit to make ends meet. Credit reports obtained by\ngovernment investigators in October 2008 (FORM, Item 8) and by DOHA adjudicators in\nMarch 2009 (FORM, Item 7) listed a delinquent credit card with a balance due of\n$12,532, which was placed for collection in October 2008. Applicant resolved that debt\nthrough a settlement agreement in December 2008. (FORM, Item 6) The credit reports\nalso showed a delinquent home equity account with a balance due of $5,770, which was\nreferred for collection in August 2008. Applicant paid off that debt in March 2009.\n(FORM, Item 6) \nStill unresolved are two more delinquent accounts listed in the credit reports. One\nappears to be another home equity-related account with a balance due of $20,492\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). The other is a delinquent credit card account with a current balance due of\nabout $41,449 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Both have been referred to collection agencies. On April\n30, 2008, Applicant and her husband completed a 13-week financial counseling course.\n(FORM, Item 6) In addition to receiving instruction on personal financial management,\nthey were advised through that course to pay their smaller debts one at a time so that\nthey were completely resolved before tackling their larger debts. As to the remaining\ndelinquencies, Applicant avers she and her husband intend to be debt free by the end of\n2010, but she did not provide a schedule of payments that will accomplish that goal.\nA personal financial statement (PFS) Applicant submitted in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in May 2009, showed she and her husband earn about $5,195 each\nmonth after deductions and monthly expenses. They also have about $16,900 in\nsavings plus about $18,291 in her husband\u2019s retirement account. The PFS also\nreflected that they have about $3,000 remaining each month after all expenses and their\nmortgage are paid. (FORM, Item 6)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 18\n(Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe government presented sufficient information in the FORM to establish that\nApplicant has a history of financial problems reflected through delinquent credit card\naccounts and unpaid mortgage and home equity accounts. The debts listed in the SOR\nhave been delinquent and unresolved for several years. Further, Applicant has\nacknowledged that she and her husband used credit cards to excess for several years\nto compensate for their inability to make ends meet. The two remaining debts total more\nthan $61,000 and there is no information that shows the debts have been paid or\n\n5\notherwise resolved. The government\u2019s information raises a security concern about\nApplicant\u2019s finances addressed in AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). In response, Applicant has\npresented information showing that Applicant\u2019s financial status has improved over the\npast two years through increased income for her and her husband. They have\nincreased their savings and retirement accounts, they have a significant positive\nmonthly cash flow, and they appear to be living within their means. Applicant also\nestablished that, several months before receiving DOHA interrogatories and before the\nSOR was issued, she was already paying or acting to resolve several delinquent debts\nother than those alleged in the SOR. Further, she and her husband sought credit\ncounseling to improve their ability to get out of debt and to improve their overall financial\nhealth. Accordingly, the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control) and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply. \nAvailable information also shows that the debts alleged did not result from recent\nconduct or circumstances. Despite struggling to make ends meet from about 1998\nthrough 2008, Applicant and her husband experienced a distinct period of difficulty\nbetween December 2005 and February 2008 due to uneven and insufficient income.\nTogether with the aforementioned information about Applicant\u2019s current financial health\nand actions to resolve her past debts, the record also supports application of the\nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nAs to application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), beginning\nin 1998, the adverse financial impacts resulting from Applicant\u2019s decision to move back\nto where she was raised to start a family could not be foreseen. In hindsight, their\ndecision not to move in 2003 despite having experienced protracted financial problems,\nappears to have been an instance of poor judgment. However, they were\nunderstandably reluctant to move their children and her husband had received a raise\nthat convinced them to stay. Later, their income suffered when his pay was converted to\na commission-only basis. These facts, combined with the information about their actions\nto resolve their debts once their income stabilized and increased, support application of\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n6\nAG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s remaining debt is significant. However, the amount of actual\ndebt is not always dispositive of whether an applicant should be disqualified under this\nguideline. Here, there is significant cash flow, increased savings, no indication of current\ndelinquencies or use of credit cards, and a record of Applicant\u2019s proactive attempts to\nresolve her remaining delinquencies. On balance, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns raised by the government\u2019s information about her finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant, a 35-year-old\nengineer and mother of five, is presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. She and\nher husband have been married for more than 10 years, and their financial problems\nhave arisen from poor decisions born of their attempts to raise their family in a location\nthey valued for that purpose, but where, because of insufficient job opportunities, they\nstruggled to make ends meet. Despite no available information about Applicant\u2019s job\nperformance or standing in the community, the record evidence of her recent efforts to\npay down her debts and to improve her finances reflects favorably on her character and\nreliability. Despite significant remaining debt, her proactive repayment efforts and her\nimproved financial health make it likely she will continue to resolve her debts and avoid\nsimilar problems in the future. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available\n9\ninformation bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances shows she has sufficiently addressed the\ngovernment\u2019s doubts about her suitability for access to classified information.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG G, Alcohol Involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.) and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the five Guideline G allegations and did not respond to the Guideline J allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions of the five Guideline G allegations are admitted herein as findings of fact. (Item 1; Item 3.) Applicant is 25 years old, never married, and employed as a business analyst by a federal contractor. In 2006, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Financial Services. He has worked for his current employer since October 2008. He has not previously held a security clearance. (Item 4.) Applicant began drinking alcohol when he was in high school. He attended college from August 2002 until his graduation in May 2006. In April 2003, while an underage college student, he was cited for A Minor in Possession of a Malt Beverage.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) G, Alcohol Consumption. For reasons discussed in the \nbody of this decision, I conclude that drafting flaws obscured the substance of the \nsecurity concerns alleged under AG J, Criminal Conduct.  Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on October 10, 2008. On June 10, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under AG G, Alcohol Involvement and AG J, Criminal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nNovember 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn July 22, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that his \ncase be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. On August 26, 2009, the \nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated August 27, 2009, DOHA \nforwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional \ninformation and/or objections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nAugust 31, 2009. His response was due on September 30, 2009. He did not file \nadditional information within the required time period. On November 3, 2009, the case \nwas assigned to me for a decision.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. alleges that disqualifying conduct alleged under Guideline G, Alcohol \nInvolvement, as \u201cset forth in subparagraphs 1.a-1.f. above\u201d also constitutes disqualifying \nconduct under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The SOR lists five, and not six, \nallegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline G. Accordingly, sua sponte, I \namend the SOR allegation at \u00b6 2.a. by deleting the reference to SOR subparagraph 1.f., \nwhich does not exist.       \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG G, Alcohol \nInvolvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.) and one allegation of disqualifying conduct \nunder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the five Guideline G allegations and did not respond to the Guideline J \nallegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions of the five Guideline G allegations are admitted \nherein as findings of fact. (Item 1; Item  3.) \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old, never married, and employed as a business analyst by \na federal contractor. In 2006, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Financial \nServices. He has worked for his current employer since October 2008. He has not \npreviously held a security clearance.  (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was in high school. He attended \ncollege from August 2002 until his graduation in May 2006. In April 2003, while an \nunderage college student, he was cited for A Minor in Possession of a Malt Beverage. \nHe appeared in court with an attorney his parents hired to represent him. He was fined \nand sentenced to 24 hours of community service. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.; Item 5 at 6.) \n \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant was still not old enough to legally purchase alcohol. \nHowever, he purchased a case of beer and, to complete the transaction, provided the \nclerk with a picture identification card that falsified his date of birth to show that he was \nof legal age to purchase alcohol. He was stopped by police, who impounded the case of \nbeer, and cited him with Minor in Possession of Alcoholic (Malt) Beverage. He was \nsentenced to 32 hours of community service and paid a fine. After he completed the \ncommunity service and paid the required fine, the charge was dismissed. (Item 5 at 7.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant was charged with Obtain Alcohol with \nFalse Driver\u2019s License. Although Applicant admitted he used a false driver\u2019s license to \npurchase alcohol in June 2004, the record establishes that the only citation issued to \nhim at that time was Minor in Possession of Alcoholic (Malt) Beverage. (Item 5 at 6-8.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college in May 2006. After graduation, he held a variety \nof jobs. From January 2007 until July 2008, he was employed as an accounting \ncoordinator with a government contractor. In June 2007, he was arrested and charged \nwith Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). He was found guilty of a reduced charge of \nReckless Driving and sentenced to 30 days in jail (suspended). Additionally, he paid a \nfine of $300, plus court costs, was directed to take an alcohol education program, and \nhis driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.; Item 3; Item 5 at 2; Item \n7; Item 8.) \n \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with (I) Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol and (II) Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.08% or Higher. \nApplicant pled No Contest to Count I and was fined $1,912. Charge II was stricken. \nApplicant\u2019 driver\u2019s license was suspended from November 19, 2008 through January 9, \n2009. He was placed on five years of summary probation, ordered to complete nine \ndays of public service, attend a one-time Mothers Against Drunk Driving victim impact \npanel presentation, and complete a nine-month alcohol education program. In April \n2009, his alcohol education counselor reported that he was attending the alcohol \neducation program as required. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.; Item 6 at 2, 5-15, 17; Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant drinks alcohol to lose his inhibitions and to improve his social contacts \nwith others. He reports that when he drinks alcohol, he becomes happy and more \nsociable. He denies that his use of alcohol raises behavioral problems that would \nrequire him to stop alcohol use. In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant \nreported that he drank beer two to three times a month. On those occasions, he drinks \nthree to eight 12-ounce cans of beer. He drinks to intoxication \u201conce every month or \ntwo.\u201d He intends to continue to drink alcoholic beverages. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.; Item 5 at 5; Item \n6  at 1-2.)       \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol\u2013related arrests were reported in October 2008 by the \nCriminal Justice Information Services Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI). (Item 8.) \n \n \nApplicant did not respond to the Criminal Conduct allegation of the SOR. No \nreason is given in the record for his lack of response. \n \n \nAs noted under Procedural Matters, supra., SOR allegation 2.a referenced one \nallegation (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) that did not exist as a SOR allegation under Guideline G.  \nAdditionally, allegation 2.a. alleged that all Guideline G allegations constituted criminal \nconduct under Guideline J. As previously noted in this decision, there was insufficient \nrecord evidence to establish that Applicant was charged with Obtain Alcohol With False \nDriver\u2019s License, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Moreover, in allegation 2.a., the Government \n\n \n4 \n \n \nalleged under Guideline J that Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol and his enrollment in an \nalcohol education program, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e., constituted criminal conduct.   \n \n \nSection 3(1) of Enclosure 1 of the Directive requires that an Applicant be \nprovided \u201c[a] written statement of reasons why his access authorization may be denied \nor revoked, which shall be as comprehensive and detailed as the national security \npermits.\u201d \n \n \nSection E3.1.3. of Enclosure 3 of the Directive states, in pertinent part: \u201cAn \nunfavorable clearance decision shall not be made unless the applicant has been \nprovided with a written SOR that shall be as detailed and comprehensive as the national \nsecurity permits.\u201d \n \n \nSection E3.1.4. of Enclosure 3 of the Directive states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe \napplicant must submit a detailed written answer to the SOR under oath or affirmation \nthat shall admit or deny each listed allegation. A general denial or other similar answer \nis insufficient.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n I have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions.  I \nhave especially considered AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). AG \u00b6  22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent.\u201d   \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIn 2003 and 2004, Applicant was cited for possession of alcohol as a minor. In \n2007 and 2008, he was arrested for alcohol-related driving offenses. His most recent \nalcohol-related driving offense occurred fifteen months ago, in August 2008. He is a \nhabitual consumer of alcohol. He drinks to intoxication \u201conce every month or two.\u201d \nNothing in the record suggests he has been diagnosed as an abuser of alcohol or as \nalcohol dependent. However, despite two arrests for driving under the influence of \nalcohol, he continues to drink alcohol and intends to drink alcohol in the future. He has \nparticipated in alcohol awareness education, and he is presumably aware of the serious \nconsequences to himself and to others of driving under the influence of alcohol. These \nfacts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23 (d) if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d  \n \n \n \nApplicant is now 25 years old. He admitted alcohol-related conduct in high \nschool, in college, and as a post-college professional. His most recent arrest for driving \nunder the influence of alcohol occurred in August 2008 and is therefore recent. He has \nparticipated in alcohol awareness education. He has not been diagnosed as alcohol \ndependent or as an alcohol abuser. He continues to drink alcohol to intoxication, and he \nintends to drink alcohol in the future. Accordingly, I conclude that none of the Guideline \nG mitigating conditions fully applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSection 3(1) of Enclosure 1 of the Directive requires that the Government provide \nan applicant with a written SOR which is \u201cas comprehensive and detailed as the \nnational security permits.\u201d Additionally, Section E 3.1.4. of Enclosure 3 requires an \napplicant to \u201csubmit a detailed written answer to the SOR under oath or affirmation that \nshall admit or deny each listed allegation.\u201d \n \n \n \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that all of the Guideline G allegations also \nconstituted criminal conduct under Guideline J. While Applicant answered the Guideline \nG allegations in the SOR, he did not answer the Guideline J allegation, and no reason \nwas provided for his failure to do so. However, the Government\u2019s Guideline J allegation \nwas poorly framed, inaccurate, and misleading, three reasons why an applicant \nuntrained in legal proceedings and pleadings might find it confusing, intimidating, and \ndifficult or impossible to answer. \n \n \n \nSection E3.1.3. of Enclosure 3 of the Directive states that \u201can unfavorable \nclearance decision shall not be made unless the applicant has been provided with a \nwritten SOR that shall be as detailed and comprehensive as the national security \npermits.\u201d \n \n \nThe SOR in this case provided Applicant with detailed and comprehensive \ninformation supporting the Guideline G allegations, and Applicant provided written \nanswers to all Guideline G allegations. However, the Government failed to provide \nApplicant with coherent and detailed information sufficient to establish an allegation of \ncriminal conduct under Guideline J. Accordingly, I conclude the Guideline J allegation in \nthis case for Applicant. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young adult who is \nwell educated and skilled. His employer has entrusted him with fiduciary and analytic \nresponsibilities. \n \nAt the same time, Applicant has been arrested twice for driving a vehicle while \nunder the influence of alcohol. After his first arrest in 2007, he was ordered to take a \ncourse in alcohol education. Even after being made aware of the dangers of drinking \nand driving, he was again arrested for driving under the influence in 2008. He continues \nto drink alcohol and drinks to intoxication once every one or two months. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct raises questions about his current trustworthiness and reliability.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his   \nalcohol consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:                       Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c. through 1.e: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on September 15, 2008, as part of her employment with a defense contractor. \nOn June 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 8, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 14, 2009. She admitted six and \ndenied two of the allegations under Guideline F with explanation, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non July 10, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on July 20, 2009. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on July 30, 2009, for a hearing on August 19, 2009. Applicant signed \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nfor the Notice of Hearing on August 3, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \ngovernment offered seven exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through \n7, which were received without objection. Applicant and one witness testified on her \nbehalf and offered nine exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A - I which were \nreceived without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August \n25, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and has been an office manager for a defense \ncontractor for one year. She is a high school graduate who is taking college level \ncourses. She is married with three grown children. This is her first request for a security \nclearance (Tr. 22). Applicant and her husband's monthly income is approximately \n$3,600. Applicant's husband is also reimbursed for some of his expenses by his \nemployer. Their monthly expenses are approximately $3,400, leaving $200 monthly in \ndiscretionary funds (Tr. 35-37; Gov. Ex. 4, Answer to Interrogatories, Personal Financial \nStatement at 6).  \n \nCredit reports list the following financial issues for Appellant; a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy filed in December 2004, and dismissed in February 2005 (SOR 1.a); a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy filed in March 2005, with debts discharged in June 2005 (SOR \n1.b); a cell phone account in collection for $519 (SOR 1.c); a charged off credit union \naccount for $722 (SOR 1.d); a credit card in collection for $708 (SOR 1.e); another \ncredit card account in collection for $1,094 (SOR 1.f); a charged off account for $395 \n(SOR 1.g); and a remaining debt owed on a vehicle repossession for $17,580 (SOR 1.h; \nGov. Ex. 2, Credit report, dated March 18, 2009; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated \nOctober 21, 2008). \n \nApplicant's daughter was living with Applicant and her husband in 2004. The \ndaughter had medical problems and was pregnant requiring support from Applicant and \nher husband. Applicant and her husband were unable to pay their debts so they \nconsulted a lawyer who suggested filing the bankruptcy. Applicant and her husband \nfiled a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2004 (SOR 1.a). The bankruptcy showed \nliabilities of over $150,000 most of which was for $137,000 owed on Applicant's house \nand three vehicles, two cars and a camper (Tr. 22-25; Gov. Ex. 8, Bankruptcy Schedule \nD, filed December 11, 2004). The wage earner plan payments were too high for them to \npay so they requested the bankruptcy be dismissed. It was dismissed in February 2005. \nApplicant and her husband submitted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2005, listing the \nsame debts as listed in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy (Gov. Ex. 7, Schedule D, filed March \n8, 2005). All debts were discharged by the bankruptcy in June 2005, to include the \nloans for their house and the two cars which were returned (SOR 1.b). Applicant and \nher husband were starting with a clean slate of debts except for the camper which they \n\n \n3 \n \n \nkept at the request of the creditor. They made payments on the camper until May 2008, \nwhen they were no longer able to make payments because their daughter's child their \ngrandchild, was now living with them. The camper was returned to the creditor in May \n2008 (Tr. 25-26).  \n \nAfter the bankruptcy discharge in June 2005, Applicant and her husband had to \npurchase new cars and find a place to live. Applicant had worked for over 12 years \nmaking $12 per hour. She could no longer meet the physical requirements of the job \nand her doctor advised her to change occupations. Applicant became a receptionist but \nwas only paid $8 an hour for that job. She also had periods of unemployment due to \nsickness and injury (Tr. 26-27). Applicant continued to make some payments on her \ndebts from March 2006 until 2009 as best she could.  She did not make full payments \nbut did make some payments on most of the debt (Tr.33-34).  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c is for a cell phone. Applicant and her husband \nhad service from the company at one time. They switched service providers and paid all \nof the bill. When notified of the debt a number of years ago, she disputed it with the \nprovider. It has been removed from her latest credit report as reported by the credit \nagency (Tr. 29-30, 45-46; Gov. Ex. 6, Fax information from Applicant at 6, Experian \nreport, dated June 11, 2009). \n \nThe credit union credit card debt at SOR 1.d was opened by Applicant's daughter \nwithout Applicant's knowledge. Applicant was listed as a co-signer on the card.  She did \nnot know about the card and never used it. The credit union acknowledged that \nApplicant does not owe the debt (Tr. 27-29, 46; Gov. Ex. 6, Fax Information from \nApplicant at 10, Letter, dated June 13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debts listed at SOR 1.e and 1. f are for credit cards Applicant and \nher husband took out after the bankruptcy discharge in 2005. The cards were mainly \nused in support of their Shriner activities for disabled children. They usually travel in \nsupport of Shriner activities about twice a year. Applicant has been making payments \non these debts (Tr. 30-31, 46-48; Gov. Ex. 6, Fax Information from Applicant, at 11, \nCheck, dated June 20, 2009; App. Ex. C, Bank debit, dated June 28, 2009; App. Ex. D, \nBank debit, dated July 26, 2009; App. Ex. E, check, dated June 20, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.g is for a loan Applicant's husband took out in both \nof their names. Applicant believed the debt was paid. After learning the debt was still \noutstanding, she has been paying on the debt. The remaining balance on this account is \napproximately $320 (Tr. 31, 48-49; App. Ex. F, Check, dated June 16, 2009; App. Ex. \nG, Check, dated July 20, 2009). \n \nThe repossession debt at SOR 1.h is for the camper. The creditor requested \nApplicant and her husband keep the camper after the bankruptcy and continue to make \npayments of about $498 monthly. When Applicant had to take a lower paying position, \nthey continued to make payments for less than the required amount until it was \nreturned. They voluntarily returned the camper to the creditor in May 2008, since they \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncould not afford to make the payments. When the creditor notified Applicant of the debt \nafter the camper was sold, Applicant agreed to make payments of $75 per month on the \naccount. She has been making monthly payments since March 2009 (Tr. 31-33, 49-50; \nApp. Ex. H, Check, dated June 22, 2009; App. Ex. I, Check, dated July 21, 2009). \n \nApplicant's immediate supervisor testified that shortly after Applicant started \nworking for the defense contractor, her potential for higher level positions was \nrecognized by the company leaders. After a few months, Applicant was moved to the \noffice manager position at corporate headquarters. She is recognized as a trustworthy \nemployee who keeps information confidential. Her duties include managing the \ncorporate credit card accounts and arranging employee travel. She is responsible for \npurchasing supplies and overseeing the payroll. She has been recommended to be the \nfacilities security officer requiring her to have a security clearance. Applicant is \nconsidered by the company leaders to be trustworthy, reliable, and has an excellent \nability to handle classified information (Tr. 51-54). \n \nApplicant presented two letters of recommendation. A friend wrote that she has \nknown Applicant for over 20 years and considers her to be trustworthy and reliable \n(App. Ex. A, Letter, undated). The leader of Applicant's Shriner chapter wrote that he \nhas known Applicant for over ten years. Applicant is involved in a number of Shriner \nfund raisings and charitable activities. She is organized, efficient, competent, and has \nexcellent rapport with others. She is very dependable and trustworthy. She has been \ntrusted with large sums of money and personal information. He would trust her to \nmanage any type of information (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated August 18, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \n\n \n5 \n \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as listed on credit reports and admitted by \nApplicant are a security concern raising Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).   \n \n \nA bankruptcy discharge itself is not a security concern since bankruptcy is a legal \nand permissible means of resolving debts. Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter \n\n \n6 \n \n \n13 bankruptcy that was dismissed and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that discharged her \ndebts. The bankruptcy discharge released Applicant of the burden of paying most of the \ndebts that arose from the expenses of caring for her daughter and grandchild. A creditor \nrequested Applicant to keep one debt on a camper. Additional debts arose after the \nbankruptcy discharge, and they should be examined to determine financial responsibility \nand the impact on security worthiness. The debts she accumulated after the bankruptcy \ndo create a financial consideration security concern and raise the disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n \nApplicant disputed two of the debts listed in the SOR (SOR 1.c, and 1.d). I \nconsidered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve he issue). One of the debts was removed from her credit report by the \ncredit reporting agency. The creditor on the other debt acknowledged that Applicant \ndoes not owe this debt. Based on the information provided by Applicant, I conclude \nthese debts are not delinquent debts attributable to Applicant. SOR 1.c and 1.d, are \nfound for Applicant.  \n \n \nThere are four delinquent debts remaining for consideration. Two debts are for \ncredit cards used by Applicant and her husband for expenses in their charitable \nactivities with the Shriners. One debt is for a loan taken out by Applicant's husband. The \nfourth debt is for the camper remaining from the bankruptcy discharge. \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony concerning the four remaining debts. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances) have some application to Applicant's circumstances. All four \ndebts are still being paid so they are current debts and not old or infrequent. Applicant \nincurred the debts because she cared for her daughter and then granddaughter. She \nhad to take a lower paying job because she could no longer physically perform her \nprevious job. Her new job lowered her hourly pay by a third. She also was out of work \nfor some time because of sickness and illness. These conditions were beyond her \ncontrol and caused financial problems. The debts pertaining to the credit cards and the \nloan happened in support of their charitable and normal circumstances so they can \nrecur. The camper repossession is a carryover from the bankruptcy and this is unlikely \nto recur. Applicant is paying on these debts so they do not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. By making arrangement to pay these \ndebts, she acted responsibly under the circumstances.   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debt only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant \nhas the ability and a strong desire to pay the debts. She established her good-faith \neffort to pay the four debts. She presented information to show that she has been \npaying the debts according to her agreements with the creditors. The payment plans are \ncredible and reasonable under her financial circumstances. Applicant mitigated security \nconcerns based on her finances. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's good \nreputation at work and in the community for trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment. I considered that she and her husband devote their time to the charitable \nactivities of the Shriners. I considered that some of her debts are directly attributed to \ntheir charitable activities.  \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. She is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All \nthat is required is that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems and takes \nsignificant action to implement that plan. The entirety of her financial situation and her \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which her plan to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreduce her outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable \ninformation about the person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment by presenting \nsufficient information to show she has payment plans in effect for the four outstanding \ndebts and that her payments are current according to the plan. She has sufficient \nmonthly income to meet her present obligations. Applicant demonstrated that her plan is \ncredible and realistic, and she is managing her finances responsibly under the \ncircumstances. The management of her present finances and her past obligations \nindicates she will be concerned, responsible, and not careless in regard to classified \ninformation. Applicant is not financially overextended and she is living within her means. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. She established she is suitable for a security \nclearance. I conclude Appellant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant executed and signed his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on\nOctober 9, 2007. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J and H on\nOctober 6, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 14, 2009. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations on November 19, 2009, and\nrequested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nMarch 31, 2010\n\nItem 3, attachments.\n1\nItem 4.\n2\n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on December 15, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nDecember 28, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt to file objections and submit material\nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response or additional\nevidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on March 22, 2010. The government\nsubmitted seven exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-7 and admitted into the\nrecord. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and admitted as Item 3, and\nthe SOR has been marked as Item 1.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n2.a, and 2.b of the SOR, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. He also provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence\nof record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 21 years old, works as a technician on the information\ntechnology (IT) helpdesk for a Department of Defense contractor. Applicant began\nworking for his employer in October 2007 on the helpdesk. His first supervisor described\nhim as intelligent, hard-working, reliable, and conscientious. She opined that he was\none of her valuable employees, who never lost his \u201ccool\u201d with customers, and could be\ncounted on to \u201cgo above and beyond for a customer.\u201d When she accepted a  manager\nposition in another office, she requested that the office hire Applicant and it did. A\ncoworker at Applicant\u2019s new office, describes him as a valued employee with great\ncustomer service skills. Applicant works well with his team members and his supervisor\nbelieves Applicant has good potential.1\nApplicant graduated from high school in May 2007. He is single and lives with his\nmother, whom he helps to support.2\nOver New Year\u2019s 2008, Applicant attended a party with a friend and another\ncasual friend. At this party, Applicant experimented with marijuana by taking two hits\nfrom a marijuana cigarette. He did not purchase the marijuana and did not know who\nprovided the marijuana for the party. At another party in January 2008 with the same\ntwo friends, Applicant again experimented with marijuana. The marijuana made him\nmore talkative, relaxed, and hungry, as well as dizzy and nauseous. He has not used\nmarijuana since this time. He does not have any contact with these individuals and has\nnot seen the casual friend since January 2008. He signed a statement of intent not to\n\nItem 3, with attachments; Item 6.\n3\nId.\n4\nId.\n5\nId.\n6\n3\nuse any illegal drugs, including marijuana, and agreed to the revocation of his clearance\nfor any violation.3\nOn March 14, 2008, Applicant completed his work for the day and started his\ndrive home. His normal travel time to home took about 90 minutes. On this date, traffic\ncongestion extended his commuting time an additional 30 to 60 minutes. Before he\narrived home, Applicant stopped at a gas station. He pulled his car near the only\navailable gasoline pump. Because the driver of the car behind him had parked his car in\na manner which limited Applicant\u2019s access to the gasoline pump, Applicant signaled the\ndriver twice to move his car back. The driver did not. When Applicant approached the\ndriver in his car, he realized that the driver was talking on his cell phone. Applicant\nagain asked the driver to move his car and the driver responded: \u201cYou can ask me\nnicely.\u201d4\nApplicant\u2019s attitude towards the driver changed with this comment. Applicant\nagain asked the driver to move his car since his was not purchasing gasoline and\ncommented that the driver should watch how he was acting. Both became defensive\nand the incident escalated when the driver took off his seat belt. Applicant felt\nthreatened by this behavior and returned to his car. He retrieved a small knife from his\ncar\u2019s emergency kit and displayed it as he stood by his car, but made no oral threat to\nthe driver. He denies an intent to use it; rather, he displayed it as a deterrent. Both he\nand the driver remained at their cars. He then realized he was not behaving any better\nthan the driver and put his knife away. He completed his gasoline purchase and left.5\nShortly after leaving the gas station, the local police stopped Applicant. The\npolice asked him about the incident with the driver and he provided his explanation of\nthe events. The police arrested him and charged him with first degree assault, second\ndegree assault, reckless endangerment because he displayed his knife in public,\ndangerous weapon - concealed (because he had a knife in his car), dangerous weapon\nwith intent to injure, and possession of marijuana. The police searched his car after he\ngave consent and found marijuana. He denies the marijuana was his. Because he\nviewed the incident as an argument, he did not believe he would be arrested and was\nsurprised when the police arrested him.6\nThe police took Applicant to the police station and detained him for several\nhours. He appeared before a judge, who released him without requiring that he post\nbail. Applicant hired an attorney to represent him. Applicant reported his arrest to his\n\nItem 5; Item 6.\n7\nItem 3; Item 5; Item 6.\n8\n4\nfacility security officer the same day. The facility security officer filed an incident report\non March 18, 2008.7\nIn April 2008, one month after Applicant\u2019s arrest and before Applicant\u2019s trial, the\nprosecutor notified the court that the first degree assault charge was \u201cnolle prosequied.\u201d\nBased on the recommendation of his attorney, Applicant voluntarily attended an anger\nmanagement class and drug awareness class. At his trial in July 2008, Applicant pled\nguilty to reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor. The court placed the remaining four\ncharges, second degree assault, dangerous weapon with intent to injure, dangerous\nweapon - conceal, and possession of marijuana, on the \u201cSTET\u201d docket for 90 days. The\ncourt sentenced Applicant to 91 days in jail, suspending 90 days and crediting Applicant\nwith 1 day served; fined him $1,000 plus costs of $57.50, then suspended $750;\ndirected 48 hours of community service; and placed him on 12 months probation. The\ntrial summary indicated that Applicant would get probation before judgment (PBJ) after\npaying his fines and ACS (although undefined, this is probably community service).\nApplicant completed his community service between July 2008 and October 2008. He\nbelieves his case has been expunged, but has not provided proof nor has he provided\nproof that he completed his probation. Applicant states that he has learned from this\nincident and that his behavior on this occasion is out of character.8\nApplicant does not have any other arrests. Applicant denies smoking marijuana\nwhile holding a security clearance. Based on the information in the record, it is unlikely\nthat Applicant has been granted a security clearance. The record contains no evidence\nthat Applicant has been diagnosed with a substance abuse problem related to his\nmarijuana use.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern, and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and\n\n6\n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated\nrehabilitation program.\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with multiple offenses related to an\nargument with another individual at a gas station and with possession of marijuana after\nfinding marijuana in his car. Applicant also admitted using marijuana in early January\n2008. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply. While Applicant has not provided documentation\nthat his probation has ended, the court sentenced him to 12 months beginning in July\n2008. Given the record does not contain any evidence that he violated the terms of his\nprobation, I find that he is not currently on probation.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns, and the\nfollowing may apply in this case:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nThe police arrested Applicant two years ago. Since then he has not been\ninvolved in any other criminal incidents. The circumstances surrounding his arrest could\noccur again given that the incident with the driver occurred at the end of a long work day\nand after being stuck in rush hour, which resulted in frayed nerves and impatience.\nApplicant was not pressured into his actions; rather he reacted to a perceived threat.\nThere is some evidence of rehabilitation as he indicates that he has learned a valuable\nlesson from this incident. In addition, his supervisor and now manager praises his work\nethic and customer service skills. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) have partial applicability in this\ncase.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\n\n7\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nApplicant smoked a marijuana cigarette on two occasions in January 2008 while\nattending parties with friends. Because he held the marijuana cigarette to smoke it, he\npossessed marijuana. The police found marijuana in his car after a search. Applicant\nhas not been diagnosed with a substance abuse problem  AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply\nin this case.\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is limited. He has not smoked marijuana in two\nyears nor has he seen one friend with whom he smoked the marijuana since January\n2008, and he no longer associates with the other friend involved in his marijuana use.\nHe signed a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs and agreed to the automatic\nrevocation of his security clearance if he did. Through these actions, Applicant has\ndemonstrated an intent not to use any drugs in the future. He has mitigated the security\nconcerns about his past drug use under AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) and AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period\nof abstinence; and, (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation).\n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nsmoked marijuana on two social occasions, but has not used marijuana since. He\nrecognizes that drug use is inappropriate and has agreed not to use illegal drugs in the\nfuture. He does not associate with the friends with whom he smoked marijuana and\ndoes not intend to do so in the future. His agreement to the automatic revocation of his\nsecurity clearance should he use illegal drugs in the future shows his understanding of\nthe consequences of any future drug use.  \nAfter a long workday and a long-time in rush hour traffic, Applicant became\ninvolved in a incident with a man at a gas station. Applicant perceived the removal of\nthe seatbelt by the driver as a threat and reacted to his perception by taking a small\nknife from his car and displaying it. He used poor judgment and showed his lack of\nmaturity when he made this decision. He realized that he was acting improperly and put\nthe knife away. Nonetheless the police arrested him and charged him with five criminal\nacts related to his conduct, which he immediately reported to his security officer. He did\nnot resist arrest and pled guilty to the misdemeanor offense of reckless endangerment.\nHe completed his probation and has not been involved in any other criminal activity.\nPulling a knife during the course of an argument raises serious questions about\n\nOf course, my recommendation to approve Applicant\u2019s clearance in the future is not binding on the\n9\ngovernment. If Applicant\u2019s company sponsors him for a clearance one year after the date of this decision,\napproval of a clearance at that time will be based on all the facts and circumstances at that point in time. An\nadministrative judge does not have authority to commit the government to approval of a clearance at some\nfuture date. See generally ISCR Case No. 08-07540 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2010); ISCR Case No. 04-03907\nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, \u201cThe Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or\nprobationary security clearance to allow [him or] her the opportunity to have a security clearance while [he or\nshe] works on [his or] her financial problems.\u201d and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13,\n2004)).\n9\nApplicant\u2019s judgment. He was only 19 years old at the time, and thus, he lacked\nappropriate insight into the negative consequences of his conduct. His age and\nimmaturity contributed to this bad decision. Applicant is now two years older and seems\nto have learned from this incident. I did not have the opportunity to assess his sincerity\nand credibly at a hearing, and am unable, at this time, to conclude that he has matured\nenough to not react in a similar manner under similar circumstances. I believe he needs\nmore time to show his ability to make mature and reasoned decisions, as well as\ndemonstrate that he has learned from this incident.  For these reasons, I find that\n9\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his criminal\nconduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his past drug use, but\nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.l. (Tr. 8-17.) He denies allegations 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n. (Tr. 8-17.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor since approximately 2001. He is married and has two children and one step-son. He served in the Navy as an electronics technician from 1985 to 1989. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; Tr. 51-55; 56-60.) SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about April 1994 and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Drugs and Driving While having Measurable Blood Alcohol in System. The Applicant admits that in 1994 he was arrested. He claims that the arrest was for \u201cwet reckless\u201d and not Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Applicant explained that the incident occurred after he was struck by a hit-and-run driver. He admitted to drinking one beer prior to the incident. He claimed his blood alcohol content was only .03%. As a result of this charge, he was required to complete a first offender program. (GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 10; Tr. 32-34.) The SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was cited in June 1996 and charged with Alcohol on Beach. Applicant admits this allegation. At hearing, he claimed he had \u201cone foot on the beach\u201d and didn\u2019t know the law. He received a $60 ticket for this offense. He paid the fine in full. (GE 5; Tr. 34.) The S",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 18, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines E, Personal Conduct, and J, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective after September 1, \n2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2011, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 21, 2011. DOHA issued \n\n \n2 \n \na notice of hearing on May 3, 2011, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nMay 23, 2011. The Government offered Exhibits (GEs) 1 through 11, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered no exhibits. He testified on his own \nbehalf and called one witness. The record was left open until May 31, 2011, for the \nApplicant to submit additional documentation. On May 31, 2011, Applicant submitted a \none-page letter, marked Exhibit (AE) A and Department Counsel indicated he had no \nobjections. AE A was admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJune 1, 2011.  \n \nAmendment to the SOR \n \nPursuant to Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.2, E3.1.3, E3.1.7, and \nE3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \u00b6 1.a through \n1.m to correct a typographical error in the lettering of the SOR, which alleged two \ndifferent allegations as \u00b6 1.i. The SOR was amended to include allegations 1.a through \n1.n (instead of 1.a through 1.m, with two 1.i\u2019s) in their correct alphabetical order without \nduplication. Further, Department Counsel moved to strike \u00b62 of the SOR in its entirety, \nwhich alleged Criminal Conduct. Applicant had no objection to the amendments and I \ngranted the motions. (Tr.8-17.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.l. (Tr. 8-17.) He \ndenies allegations 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n. (Tr. 8-17.) After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor since approximately \n2001. He is married and has two children and one step-son. He served in the Navy as \nan electronics technician from 1985 to 1989. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; Tr. 51-55; 56-60.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about April 1994 and charged \nwith Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and Drugs and Driving While having \nMeasurable Blood Alcohol in System. The Applicant admits that in 1994 he was \narrested. He claims that the arrest was for \u201cwet reckless\u201d and not Driving Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol. Applicant explained that the incident occurred after he was struck \nby a hit-and-run driver. He admitted to drinking one beer prior to the incident. He \nclaimed his blood alcohol content was only .03%. As a result of this charge, he was \nrequired to complete a first offender program. (GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 10; Tr. 32-34.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was cited in June 1996 and charged with \nAlcohol on Beach. Applicant admits this allegation. At hearing, he claimed he had \u201cone \nfoot on the beach\u201d and didn\u2019t know the law. He received a $60 ticket for this offense. He \npaid the fine in full. (GE 5; Tr. 34.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in July 2005 and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence. Applicant denied this allegation because he claims he was \n\n \n3 \n \nonly charged with Malicious Driving. He asserted he had only consumed one beer and \nwas at the legal limit on this occasion. He stated he had been given a breathalyzer test \nand his blood alcohol content was .05% or .06%. The breath test in evidence shows that \nApplicant actually had a blood alcohol content of .92%. Applicant pled guilty to the \nlesser charge of Negligent Driving. As a result of this charge, Applicant was required to \ncomplete a \u201cwitness panel.\u201d He was also fined $600. He had difficulties completing the \ncourt required witness panel because he was working in Japan at the time and could \nnot locate a comparable class. As of December 2008, Applicant had not completed the \n\u201crequirements for this ticket.\u201d(GE 1; GE 7; GE 8; GE 9; Tr. 34.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his Security \nClearance Application electronically transmitted on January 20, 2000, in response to \nquestion \u201c24. Your Police Record \u2013 Alcohol/Drug Offenses Have you ever been charged \nwith or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? For this item, report \ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or \notherwise stricken from court record. The single exception to this requirement is for \ncertain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court \nissued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d \nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d, whereas in truth, he failed to list that he had been arrested for the \nalcohol offenses as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a, and 1.b, above. Applicant explained \nthat he did not know why he answered this question \u201cNo,\u201d but denied that the \nfalsification was intentional. He testified that he has worked for the Government \u201clong \nenough to know there is no sense in hiding it.\u201d He testified he disclosed everything in his \nsecurity clearance interview. However, Applicant admitted in his April 15, 2003 \nstatement to Special Agents of the Defense Security Service that with respect to the \ncharge of Alcohol on Beach (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \u201cthe reason I did not list this on my security \nquestionnaire or discuss it during my prior interview with DSS was because it was just a \nnon-traffic ticket and I don\u2019t believe it was required.\u201d (GE 2; GE 5; Tr. 35-36.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his Security \nClearance Application electronically transmitted on January 20, 2000, in response to \nquestion \u201c27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Drug Use The \nfollowing questions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. You are required \nto answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your failure to do so could be grounds \nfor an adverse employment decision or action against you, but neither your truthful \nresponse nor information derived from your responses will be used as evidence against \nyou in any subsequent criminal proceeding.\u201d He answered \u201cNo,\u201d whereas in truth, he \ndeliberately failed to list that he had used marijuana in at least 1994. Applicant \nexplained that as a result of his \u201cWet Reckless\u201d conviction in 1994, he was required to \ntake an alcohol class. The teacher of the class thought he came to class stoned and \nasked him about it. Applicant didn\u2019t think she was serious and answered \u201csure.\u201d He was \ndismissed for that class. At hearing, Applicant denied using marijuana in 1994. \nHowever, he testified used marijuana while in college from 1984 to 1985. (GE 2; Tr. 36.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that in a signed, sworn statement dated November 28, \n2001, Applicant falsified material facts in that he stated he first used marijuana from age \n14 or 15 to September 1984 and from April 1989 to 1990. Applicant\u2019s statements with \n\n \n4 \n \nrespect to his drug use are confusing and contradictory. He testified he last used \nmarijuana in college but explained in his November 28, 2001 statement that he \u201cdid not \nuse it\u201d at college because he did not have close friends in college. His November 2001 \nstatement regarding his drug use did disclose he used cocaine and psilocybin \nmushrooms while in college. He used marijuana again from 1989 to 1990 when his \nfriends would pass around a joint. Court records indicate that in 1994, Applicant was \nreported to the Court for failure to comply with the requirements of the DUI program by \nreporting to the program under the influence of drugs. Applicant testified he did not use \nmarijuana in 1994. (GE 6; GE 10; Tr. 36-40.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment with a \ngovernment contractor in violation of its corporate policy, which included a violation of \nthe tobacco and smoke free environment, absence from work services policy, and for \nrecording more hours on his time card than worked. Applicant claimed that his \nsupervisor did not like him. He testified that his supervisor had no proof Applicant \nsmoked in the company vehicle, as the write-up alleged. He indicated he did not know \nwhat the time card allegations were about. He just signed the write-up as was required. \nHe claimed that his supervisors were later fired for misconduct and that prior to leaving \nhis employer he filed a complaint against his supervisor. He failed to present \ndocumentation to support his claims. (GE 3; GE 8; GE 11; Tr. 40-42.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant failed to return his government issued CAC \ncard to his employer after his termination in May 2007. Applicant testified that no one \nasked him for his CAC card at the time he was terminated. Eventually, when he was \nasked to return it, he could not locate it. However, in his Answers to Interrogatories \ndated December 22, 2010, Applicant stated, \u201cMy CAC card was turned in to the security \noffice . . .\u201d He indicated he \u201chad no further communication with [new employer] about \n[his] CAC card or anything else to [his] knowledge.\u201d (GE 11; Tr. 42.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his Security \nClearance Application electronically transmitted on November 26, 2007, in response to \n\u201csection 23: Your Police Record For this item, report information regardless of whether \nthe record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record. \nThe single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the Federal \nControlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the \nauthority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. d. Have you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d Applicant did list an August \n2006 (estimated) arrest for \u201cmalicious driving\u201d and indicated he had \u201cto go to meetings \nand pay fine,\u201d but omitted his other alcohol arrests set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, above. \nApplicant explained that his omission was not intentional. He testified that he did \nanswer, \u201cYes,\u201d to this question, but only listed the most recent arrest. He did not recall \nwhy he only listed one arrest. (GE 1; Tr. 42-43.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that Applicant was arrested in October 2008 and charged \nfor Driving While License Suspended-3rd Degree. At that time, he also had an \noutstanding warrant for Driving Under the Influence (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (GE 9.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during his October \n29, 2008 interview with an investigator for the Department of Defense when he \nindicated he had not received any alcohol counseling or treatment. Contrary to his \nstatement, records reflect that Applicant received alcohol treatment while in the Navy in \napproximately 1986 and 1987. Applicant testified that in 1986 he \u201cself referred\u201d for \nalcohol treatment after he showed up late for work while serving in the Navy. He \nattended a 40 hour alcohol course. In 1988, Applicant was late for work and sent to a \ncounselor. He was referred to two weeks inpatient treatment. He testified he \nparticipated in Alcoholics Anonymous and was sober for a total of six years. Applicant \nhad no explanation for denying his alcohol treatment when he was interviewed in \nOctober 2008. He indicated he \u201cforgot\u201d about the treatment. (GE 4; GE 8; Tr. 43-45.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant was cited in September 2009 for Proof of \nRegistration. Applicant explained that he had mailed in his registration documentation to \nthe state, but had not received the registration sticker for his license plate back. He was \nparked in a parking lot and found the citation on his windshield when he returned to his \nvehicle. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that Applicant falsified a signed, certified statement dated \nApril 28, 2010, when he indicated that he had not been involved in any alcohol incidents \nexcept for the July 2005 incident. He omitted the alcohol offenses set out in \u00b6\u00b61.a and \n1.b, above. Applicant testified that he did bring up the 19951 incident (\u00b6 1.a) and that he \nforgot about the alcohol on the beach charge (\u00b6 1.b). Applicant\u2019s April 28, 2010 \nstatement supports his testimony that he did bring up what he described as the \u201cwet \nreckless\u201d charge in 1994. (GE 4; Tr. 46-47.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.n alleges that Applicant signed a notarized interrogatory dated \nDecember 22, 2010, which contained a falsified statement with respect to Applicant\u2019s \npast drug use. In the interrogatory, Applicant was asked, \u201cHave you illegally used any \ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, \nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants \n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or \nprescription drugs.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In truth, he used marijuana in at least \nOctober 2005 and from approximately 1979-1994. He also used cocaine and psilocybin \nmushrooms while attending college in 1984-1985. Applicant claims that in 2005, when \nhe was pulled over for Malicious Driving (as alleged in \u00b6 1.c.), the officer claimed to \nhave found \u201cgreen particles\u201d in Applicant\u2019s sunglasses case. The green particles were \nalleged to be marijuana. Applicant testified that the police statement was \u201cnot correct.\u201d \nHe denied intentionally falsifying this statement. (GE 3; GE 10; Tr. 47-49.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she finds her husband to be a truthful person. He \nhas been supporting her through school. They have been married for 15 years. (Tr. 56-\n60.) \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant appears to have confused the date of his 1994 arrest and indicates in his testimony and his statement that \nit occurred in 1995. \n\n \n6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, \nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that \ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for \nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or \nother group.  \n \n \nApplicant admits to being charged with consuming alcohol on the beach; his \n2005 arrest for Driving Under the Influence; failing to return his CAC card; his October \n2008 arrest for Driving While License Suspended; and that he was cited in September \n2009 for Proof of Registration. The Government also presented sufficient information to \nestablish that Applicant was arrested in 1994 for Driving Under the Influence; he was \nterminated from an employer due to violations of corporate policy; he failed to return his \nCAC card as required; he falsified material facts on his January 2000 and November \n2007 Security Clearance Applications; he falsified his November 2001 and April 2010 \nstatements; he provided the investigator with false facts in his October 2008 interview; \nand he falsified material facts in his answers to interrogatories dated December 2010. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and explanations regarding these incidents and false statements \n\n \n8 \n \nare not credible. His statements are confusing and contradictory. He has not adequately \nexplained his omissions. I find they were deliberate. His inability to tell the truth about \nhis criminal incidents and drug use, along with his termination and failure to return his \nCAC card, casts doubts on his candor and creates a vulnerability to exploitation. The \nGovernment has established sufficient concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e) to \ndisqualify Applicant from possessing a clearance.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant's falsification and poor personal conduct is unmitigated. Falsification of \ninformation provided to the Government cannot be considered minor. He has not been \nforthcoming with the truth and has made little attempt to correct his omissions. His \nstatements contain numerous inconsistencies and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Further, the arrests, drug use, employee \nmisconduct, and failure to return his CAC card demonstrate a long pattern of \nmisconduct. He has not shown sufficient steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(e) do not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant has served the Navy for six years and has worked in his current \nposition for ten years. His wife finds him to be an honest person. However, his conduct \nindicates a lack of judgment and trustworthiness, and raises doubts as to whether he \nunderstands what is required of those who hold security clearances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.n: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Junge, Personal Representative  \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence shows\nApplicant used marijuana from about 2001 to March 2006. At times, he used marijuana\nas often as two to three joints every other day. In March 2006, he was arrested and\ncharged with two felony-level drug offenses relating to his possession and cultivation of\nmarijuana plants. He pleaded guilty to one charge, and the state court withheld\nadjudication of guilt and ordered Applicant to serve probation for 18 months. He has\nbeen drug-free since his March 2006 arrest, and has since relocated to a different state\nand no longer associates with the individuals with whom he used marijuana. His\nevidence in mitigation, while not insubstantial, is insufficient to outweigh the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of his illegal drug involvement and the concomitant security\nconcerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to\nthis case. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on July 10, 2009,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline H for drug involvement and Guideline E for personal conduct. The\nSOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to decide\nwhether or not to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged the following: (1) Applicant used marijuana\nfrom about 2001 to March 2006; (2) Applicant purchased marijuana; (3) Applicant\ncultivated marijuana during 2005\u20132006; and (4) Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith two felony-level drug offenses in March 2006, to which he pleaded guilty to one\noffense and the state court withheld adjudication of guilt and ordered him to serve\nprobation for 18 months. Under Guideline E, the SOR allegation is merely a cross-\nreference to the matters alleged under Guideline H.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. In\ndoing so, he admitted the factual allegations and provided explanations. The case was\nassigned to me September 2, 2009. The hearing took place October 28, 2009. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received November 5, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated herein. Based\non the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has never\nmarried and has no children. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in\nElectrical/Electronics Engineering Technology (BSEET) in 1999. He has worked as a\nradio-frequency technician in the field of avionics since September 2008.\nApplicant is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. To\nthat end, he completed a security clearance application in October 2008. He disclosed\nhis March 2006 drug-related charges in response to questions about his police record.\nIn response to questions about his use of illegal drugs and drug activity, he disclosed\n\n Exhibit 2. \n2\n Exhibit 2. \n3\n Exhibit 2. \n4\n Exhibit 2. \n5\n Exhibit 3. \n6\n Exhibit 4. \n7\n Exhibit A. \n8\n3\nusing marijuana, from an estimated date of January 2002 to March 2006, and he\ndescribed the frequency of his usage as a few times weekly. \nAfter earning his degree in 1999, Applicant obtained employment with a major\ncommunications company and worked there until he was laid off in about May 2001. He\nwas unemployed for more than a year, and he moved to another state where he lived\nwith his father. His father was a longtime user of marijuana, and Applicant began using\nmarijuana within about four months. Initially, he smoked half a joint once per month or\nonce every other month while with friends.  His marijuana usage increased beginning in\n2\n2001, and he smoked one joint one to two times per month during 2001 until about 2003\nor 2004.  From 2004 until his March 2006 arrest, he smoked two to three joints every\n3\nother day.  He attributes the increase in usage to his father\u2019s death in 2001, when his\n4\nfather was grievously injured in a motorcycle accident. Applicant was required to decide\nto terminate life support for his father, and this was a weighty decision for him. \nIn about 2005, Applicant decided to start growing his own marijuana to offset the\nexpense, as he previously purchased the marijuana. He grew the marijuana in the\ngarage. In March 2006, local law enforcement executed a search warrant at Applicant\u2019s\nhome, and they found about 20 marijuana plants at various stages of growth.  Applicant\n5\nwas arrested and charged with two offenses: (1) sale, manufacture, or deliver, or\npossession with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver a controlled substance; and (2)\nbeing a person in actual or constructive possession of marijuana. Both charges were\nfelony-level offenses.   \n6\nHe pleaded guilty to the first charge in April 2006, and the state court withheld\nadjudication of guilt.  The court also ordered Applicant to serve probation for 18 months.\n7\nApplicant completed probation without a violation.\nIn about August 2008, Applicant relocated to his state of current residence, a\ndistance of more than 450 miles from his previous residence, where he lives with his\nmother and stepfather. He began his current employment the following month. He was\nrequired to undergo and pass a drug test before starting employment. He has proved\nhimself to be an able employee, as a former supervisor described Applicant as \u201can\noutstanding employee,\u201d and his initial employee evaluation was favorable.  \n8\n\n Exhibit C. \n9\n Tr. 70. \n10\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n11\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n12\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n13\n4\nApplicant states that he has had no involvement with marijuana since March\n2006, there is no record evidence showing otherwise, and he pledged to remain drug-\nfree in the future. Applicant submitted a signed \u201cstatement of intent with automatic\nrevocation\u201d wherein he agreed to automatic revocation of a security clearance should\nhe violate any local, state, or federal drug law, or should he possess, use, or cultivate\nmarijuana anytime in the future.9\nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister both appeared as character witnesses at the\nhearing. Both witnesses were sincere and credible in their testimony. \nHis mother explained that Applicant had no problems with the law or drugs until\nhe moved in with his father in 2001. She described Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and his\nMarch 2006 arrest as \u201cheart wrenching.\u201d  She also described Applicant as a devoted\n10\nson who has been extremely helpful around the house since his return in 2008.  \nHis sister explained that she and Applicant have always had a close relationship.\nHis relocation in 2008 has allowed them to reconnect. She now sees Applicant three to\nfive times weekly. During this time, she has not seen any indications that Applicant was\nunder the influence of drugs. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n11\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n12\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n13\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n14\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n15\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n16\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n19\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n20\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n21\n5\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n14\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n15\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n16\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n17\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n18\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n21\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, and 26 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n22\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 24. \n23\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 24(b). \n24\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 25(a).\n25\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 25(c).\n26\n6\nAnalysis\nThe security concern under Guideline H for drug involvement  is as follows:\n22\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.   \n23\nDrug abuse means \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d24\nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use and illegal drug activity raises serious\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H. Applicant engaged in drug abuse  when he used\n25\nmarijuana from about 2001 until his arrest in March 2006. At times, he was a heavy\nuser, smoking two to three joints every other day. He purchased marijuana until he\nbegan growing his own in 2005, and he had about 20 marijuana plants under cultivation\nwhen arrested.  He then served probation for 18 months after he pleaded guilty to one\n26\nof the two charges against him. Although the court withheld adjudication of guilt, the\nrecord evidence shows Applicant was in no way innocent of the drug-related offenses.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns. I considered all the mitigating conditions and the most pertinent here are:\n\u2022\n\u00b6 26(a)\u2013The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n\u2022\n\u00b6 26(b)\u2013A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9). \n27\n7\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\nApplicant receives partial credit under \u00b6 26(a). The record evidence shows his\nlast involvement with illegal drugs was March 2006, when he was arrested, which is\nabout four years ago. In that sense, his illegal drug involvement may be viewed as not\nrecent. It cannot be described as infrequent or isolated conduct, however, as he was a\nregular marijuana user over a period of years, and he cultivated multiple marijuana\nplants during 2005\u20132006. Also, I cannot conclude that his actions do not continue to\ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment given the\nseriousness of his drug involvement. He was not a 20-year-old college student\ninexperienced in the ways of the world when he was using marijuana during 2001\u20132006.\nAnd he was approximately 32 or 33 years old when he began growing marijuana in\n2005. Given his age and maturity when he was involved with illegal drugs, I cannot\nconsider his actions as the product of youthful foolishness.  \nApplicant also receives credit under \u00b6 26(b). He demonstrated an intent not to\nengage in drug abuse in the future by remaining drug-free since March 2006, by\nrelocating to a different state thereby removing himself from his drug-using associates,\nand by signing the statement of intent with automatic revocation. \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate a\nperson\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the person\u2019s conduct and all the\ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine factors listed in the\nRevised Guidelines as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n27\nI gave due consideration to Applicant\u2019s case in light of the whole-person concept,\nbut any credit due him is not enough to overcome the security concerns. On balance,\nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to prevail. In reaching this conclusion, I\ngave substantial weight to the nature, extent, and seriousness of his illegal drug\ninvolvement and the concomitant security concerns. Growing marijuana in a private\nresidence to such an extent that it comes to the attention of the police raises serious\nquestions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment,\nand it reflects poorly on his fitness or suitability for access to classified information.\nFollowing the principles of Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, those questions or\n\n The SOR allegation under Guideline E is merely a cross-reference to the matters alleged under Guideline\n28\nH, which were addressed above. Because Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement is explicitly covered under\nGuideline H and is sufficient by itself for an adverse clearance decision, there is no good reason to consider\nthe same matters under the personal conduct guideline. Accordingly, on this basis, Guideline E is decided for\nApplicant. \n8\ndoubts are resolved against Applicant and in favor of the national interest. To conclude,\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.  \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant28\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

His statement of reasons (SOR) listed 18 debts totaling $20,025. He \ndisputed three debts, and 15 debts totaling $18,293 are not resolved. Applicant stole \ntelephone services, made a false sworn statement to a criminal investigator, forged a \nlieutenant colonel\u2019s signature, falsified a security clearance application, lied to a \nDefense Security Service (DSS) special agent, and used cocaine while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Financial considerations and personal conduct concerns are not \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 11, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (Item 5). On \nFebruary 5, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR \nto Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nAugust 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) \nand E (personal conduct) (Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). \n \nOn March 11, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na decision on the record (Item 4). A complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM), dated April 27, 2010, was provided to him on May 6, 2010, and he was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not respond to the FORM. (file) The case was \nassigned to me on July 20, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.g, 1.j, 1.q, \n2.a, 2.c, 2.e, 2.f, 2.g, and 2.i (Item 4) For SOR \u00b6 2.h, he admitted using cocaine while \nholding a security clearance on December 31, 2005, rather than in January 2006, as \nalleged in the SOR. (Item 4) His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working as a \nprogram administrator. (Item 5 at 6, 13) He attended college from 1983 to 1996 and \n2003 to 2004. (Item at 5 at 11-12) When he completed his October 11, 2007, SF 86, he \nestimated he would receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in July 2008.

(Item 5 at 26)   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s unsecured, non-priority debts, totaling $48,438, were discharged \nunder Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in December 1999. (Item 1, Item 7 at 3) His \nSOR lists 18 unpaid SOR debts, totaling $20,025, which are as follows: 1.b ($485); 1.c \n($247); 1.d ($259); 1.e ($171); 1.f ($522); 1.g ($347); 1.h ($5,883); 1.i ($785); 1.j ($199); \n \n1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated April 28, 2010, and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated May 6, 2010 \n(file). The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit \ninformation (file).  \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n1.k ($673); 1.l ($4,260); 1.m ($204); 1.n ($362); 1.o ($55); 1.p ($137); 1.q ($3,897); 1.r \n($500); and 1.s ($1,039).  \n \nApplicant disputes eight SOR debts because he believes they were discharged in \nhis December 1999 bankruptcy: 1.f ($522), 1.h ($5,883), 1.k ($673), 1.l ($4,260), 1.m \n($204), 1.n ($362), 1.p ($137), and 1.s ($1,039). (Item 4) Applicant\u2019s October 24, 2007 \ncredit report shows the accounts for the following debts were opened on the following \ndates: 1.l ($4,260\u2014March 2005); 1.m ($204\u2014July 2006); 1.n ($362\u2014May 2007); and \n1.p ($137\u2014February 2005). (Item 8 at 2, 10, 11, 12, 16, and 17) Applicant\u2019s February \n22, 2009 credit report indicates the accounts for the following debts were opened on the \nfollowing dates: 1.f ($522\u2014December 2006); 1.k ($673\u2014June 2004); and $1.h \n($5,883\u2014March 2005). (Item 9 at 2) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s ($1,039) is based on a \njudgment filed on June 29, 1994. (Item 14 at 2) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.s ($1,039) was \nautomatically included in his bankruptcy even though it was not listed on a bankruptcy \nschedule. See Financial Considerations Analysis, infra.    \n  \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect disputes of the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($485), 1.e \n($171), 1.f ($522), and 1.j ($199); however, he admitted responsibility for the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.j in his SOR response. (Item 4; Item 9 at 2; Item 10 at 1, 2; Item 11 at \n1; Item 12 at 6, 8) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are accepted as currently in dispute.  \n \nOn November 20, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nquestioned Applicant about his debts. Applicant said he had some difficulty obtaining \nfull-time employment in 2005 after leaving active duty, and he had some funeral \nexpenses from the deaths of his grandparents in 2005. (Item 12 at 5) He received \nfinancial counseling in connection with his bankruptcy in 1999; however, he did not \nreceive any recent financial counseling. (Item 12 at 10) For most of the debts listed on \nhis credit report, Applicant said he would contact the creditor, inquire about the account, \nand if it is determined to be his debt, he would pay it. (Item 12 at 6-9) Applicant did not \nprovide documentation or correspondence written to the creditors to inquire about the \nstatus of any accounts. He did not provide correspondence received from the SOR \ncreditors such as responses to inquiries, or offers to settle debts. He did not provide \nproof that he made any payments to any of the SOR creditors.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nTheft of Telephone Services and False Swearing in 1991 \n \n \nIn 1991, Applicant used a calling card number that he took without permission to \nmake telephone calls costing more than $100. (Item 16 at 2) On January 3, 1992, he \nmade a sworn statement to a law enforcement investigator claiming another service \nmember had authorized him to use the telephone card, and claiming he did not know \nanyone else who had used the calling card number. Id. at 3, 7, 8.  \n \nOn January 9, 1992, Applicant made a sworn statement to a law enforcement \ninvestigator where he said he found the telephone calling card on his own desk at his \nworkplace mixed in with some paperwork. Id. at 11. He admitted that he falsely accused \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nanother soldier of providing the calling card to Applicant because he was angry about \nan argument. Id. He falsely understated the degree of his misuse of the telephone \ncalling card in his prior sworn statement. Id. at 3, 11, 17. Applicant also admitted that he \ngave the telephone calling number information to another soldier (his roommate), who \nmade calls using the stolen card number. Id. at 15-16.  \n \nIn April 1992, Applicant received non-judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15, \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for obtaining services under false pretenses \nand false swearing. His commander imposed: (1) forfeiture of $455 pay per month for \ntwo months (suspended); (2) reduction from E-4 to E-2; (3) restriction for 45 days; and \n(4) extra duty for 45 days. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.c; Item 1; Item 4)     \n \n \nFalsification of SF 86 in 1998 \n \n \nOn December 15, 1998, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86). Section 23e of his SF 86 asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you \nbeen subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ? \n(Include non-judicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.).\u201d Applicant falsely answered, \u201cNo\u201d \ndeliberately failing to disclose the NJP described in the previous section. (SOR \u00b6 2.e; \nItem 1; Item 4)  \n \nFalse Statement to a DSS Special Agent in 2001 \n \nOn April 26, 2001, Applicant told a DSS special agent that a soldier gave him the \ncalling card in 1991 and told him he could use it to make free calls. (Item 18 at 3) \nApplicant claimed he believed he was authorized to make the free calls for morale \npurposes. Id. He said he was charged with false swearing for admitting he copied the \ncard from the victim\u2019s desk. Id. He also said he thought the false swearing charge was \ndropped. Id. The record of the NJP itself is not part of the record evidence. SOR \u00b6 1.d \nalleges that Applicant lied to the DSS special agent when he denied having any \nknowledge that the phone calling card number had been stolen, whereas in truth, he \nhad found the number himself.     \n \n \nForgery in 2004 \n \nIn August 2004, Applicant received NJP for forging the signature of an \nauthorizing official (a lieutenant colonel) on his Request for Waiver of Tuition Assistance \nReimbursement, in violation of Article 123, UCMJ. His commander imposed: (1) 14 days \nextra duty (suspended); (2) forfeiture of seven days pay ($626); and a letter of \nreprimand. (SOR \u00b6 2.f; Item 1; Item 4; Item 19 at 18) The letter of reprimand was filed in \nApplicant\u2019s Official Military Personnel File. (Item 19 at 18) When he completed his \nOctober 11, 2007, SF 86, he disclosed the forgery and NJP resolution of this offense. \n(Item 5 at 37-38)  \n \n \nAs a result of the misconduct described in the previous paragraph, Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsuspended. In January 2005, his security clearance and SCI access was reinstated with \na warning. (SOR \u00b6 2.g; Item 1; Item 4)     \n  \nCocaine Use on December 31, 2005 \n \nOn December 31, 2005, Applicant used cocaine. He said it was because of \nstress due to underemployment, expenses for his grandparent\u2019s funerals, and back \npain. (Item 12 at 5) At that time, he was in possession of a Department of Defense \nsecurity clearance. (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Item 1; Item 4) Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis \ntest for the presence of the cocaine metabolite in January 2006 at his National Guard \nunit. In July 2006, the National Guard discharged him because of his use of cocaine, \nand he received an honorable discharge. (SOR \u00b6 2.i; Item 1; Item 4) When he \ncompleted his October 11, 2007, SF 86, he disclosed the single cocaine use detected \nthrough the January 2006 urinalysis test. (Item 5 at 38) He did not receive any drug \nabuse treatment or counseling. (Item 12 at 6) \n \nAwards from Military Service \n \nApplicant has received one Meritorious Service Medal, four Army Commendation \nMedals, three Army Achievement Medals; four Army Good Conduct Medals; two \nNational Defense Service Medals; one Korea Service Medal; two Overseas Ribbons; \none Army Service Ribbon; two Professional Development Ribbons; one Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal; one unit award, and several other awards or commendations. \n(Item 20) By order dated July 16, 2006, he left the National Guard as a staff sergeant \nand the character of his service was described as Honorable. (Item 20) The reason for \nhis discharge was \u201cALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUG ABUSE REHABILITATION \nFAILURE.\u201d (Item 20) He had 16 years service towards military retirement.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in \nthis Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his \ncredit reports, his OPM interview, and his SOR response.  \n \nIn December 1999, Applicant\u2019s unsecure, non-priority debts were discharged \nunder Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His SOR lists 18 debts totaling $20,025. \nSome of his debts have been delinquent since 2005. The Government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions.   \n  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent \nSOR debts and is taking adequate steps to do so.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s underemployment in 2005 and expenses relating to the death of his \ngrandparents prior to December 2005 were unexpected events that damaged his \nfinances. He may have also had some unexpected medical expenses because of his \nback problems. He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nover the last three years. There is insufficient evidence that he maintained contact with \nhis creditors,3 and there is a paucity of evidence concerning his overall financial \ncircumstances. There is no documentary evidence that he has attempted to pay or \nsettle any of his SOR debts or attempted to establish payment plans with his creditors. \nHis documented actions were insufficient to establish he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.     \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Although he received financial counseling in \n1999 as part of his bankruptcy, he now has additional delinquent debt. Applicant did not \nprovide a credible plan to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant cannot receive full \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he has not paid, established payment plans (by \nmaking payments) or otherwise resolved any of his SOR debts. There are some initial, \npositive \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has \nadmitted responsibility for and promised to pay several SOR debts, showing some good \nfaith mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).4  \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to three debts. Two debts were documented as disputed \nin his credit reports (1.e ($171) and 1.f ($522)), and he did not subsequently admit \nresponsibility for those two debts in his SOR response. Applicant said the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.s ($1,039) was part of his bankruptcy. Civil court records establish the judgment in \nSOR \u00b6 1.s predated his bankruptcy. Absent fraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy all \nunsecured, non-priority debts are discharged when the bankruptcy court grants a \ndischarge under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code even when they are not listed on a \nbankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis v. \nNat\u2019l Revenue Service, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010).   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. After deducting three disputed debts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.s), 15 unresolved SOR debts remain and total $18,293. He did not \nprovide proof of any payments to his SOR creditors, or otherwise show sufficient \nprogress on his SOR debts. His documented efforts are simply inadequate to fully \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving the allegations in the \nSOR, there are five pertinent disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) to 16(e) provide: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \n \nIn his SOR response Applicant admitted the following misconduct: (1) On \nJanuary 3, 1992, he made a false sworn statement when he denied knowledge of \nanyone else who used the stolen calling card whereas Applicant provided the calling \ncard number to his roommate (SOR \u00b6 2.c); (2) He committed a theft of telephone \nservices of over $100 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); (3) On December 15, 1998, he deliberately failed to \ndisclose the NJP he received for theft of telephone services in 1991 on his SF 86 (SOR \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\u00b6 1.e); (4) In 2004, he forged the signature of a lieutenant colonel on his Request for \nWaiver of Tuition Assistance (SOR \u00b6 1.f); (5) On December 31, 2005, Applicant used \ncocaine while holding a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.h). AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) through 16(c) \napply. \n \nIn his SOR response Applicant denied \u00b6 2.d, which alleged on April 26, 2001, \nApplicant made a false statement to a DSS special agent. Applicant told the DSS \nspecial agent that a soldier gave Applicant the calling card in 1991 and told him he \ncould use it to make free calls. Applicant claimed he believed he was authorized to \nmake the free calls for morale purposes. Despite Applicant\u2019s denial of responsibility in \nhis SOR response for SOR \u00b6 2.d, I find he knowingly and deliberately attempted to \ndeceive the DSS special agent into believing that Applicant thought he was authorized \nto use the calling card to make long distance calls.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s theft of telephone services, \nforgery, false swearing, as well as his cocaine possession and use are covered under \nthe criminal conduct guideline, as all rules involved, when violated, are criminal offenses \nunder the UCMJ. \n  \nCertainly, such crimes violate important civil and criminal rules in our society, and \nthese offenses are conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a \nperson\u2019s professional and community standing. Thus, AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) applies. Further \ninquiry concerning the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides for seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d \napplies to mitigate AG \u00b6 16(e)(1). Security officials are well aware of Applicant\u2019s \noffenses, and his conduct is well-documented in law enforcement, security, and \npersonnel records. The federal government\u2019s knowledge of these allegations eliminates \nany vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe Applicant would \ncompromise national security to avoid public disclosure of these offenses. Any personal \nconduct security concerns (pertaining to disclosure of his criminal conduct as alleged in \nthe SOR) are mitigated.   \n \nThe sole allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.g is that Applicant\u2019s security clearance and SCI \naccess were suspended. The sole allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.i is that Applicant was \ndischarged from the Army National Guard after he tested positive for the cocaine \nmetabolite in his urine. The conduct described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.i were actions by \nsecurity or command officials (which resulted from Applicant\u2019s conduct, alleged in other \nSOR paragraphs). I find for Applicant because Applicant himself did not engage in any \npersonal conduct raising a security concern, and essentially these two SOR allegations \nare indirect duplications describing measures taken against Applicant for his conduct.   \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions detailed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) through 16(c). Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct must be \nconsidered as a whole. There is a pattern of dishonesty from 1991 to 2004 followed by \nhis cocaine use while holding a security clearance. There is insufficient mitigating \nevidence to convince me that this pattern of behavior will not continue in the future. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance, there are several factors tending to support approval of his \nclearance. Applicant is 46 years old. He should have received his bachelor\u2019s degree in \nJuly 2008. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security \nresponsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. \nGovernment, as an employee of a contractor and during his 15-year-career in the Army. \nHe earned one Meritorious Service Medal, four Army Commendation Medals, three \nArmy Achievement Medals, four Army Good Conduct Medals, as well as additional \nawards and commendations during his Army service. He was promoted to the grade of \nstaff sergeant, and in 2006 his unit characterized his service as he Honorable. There is \nevery indication that he is loyal to the United States and his employer. There is no \nevidence that he abuses alcohol. His underemployment and expenses relating to the \ndeath of his grandparents were unexpected events that damaged his finances. I give \nApplicant credit for admitting responsibility for several SOR debts. He is also credited \nwith promising to pay the debts that were established. These factors show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems for more than 10 years. His \nunsecured, non-priority delinquent debts were discharged in December 1999 under \nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. His post-bankruptcy delinquent debt dates back to \n2005. After deducting three disputed debts, 15 unresolved SOR debts remain and total \n$18,293. He did not provide proof of any payments on any of his SOR debts. In 2007, \nhe promised an OPM investigator that he would investigate and resolve his delinquent \ndebts. The concern about his financial responsibility was further emphasized when he \nreceived the SOR. Yet he did not provide documentary proof of any payments to any of \nhis SOR creditors. He had ample notice of his delinquent SOR debts, and sufficient \nopportunity to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. His promises \nto pay his delinquent debts at some date in the future are insufficient to mitigate his \nSOR debts. There is an absence of documentary evidence fully explaining why he has \nnot done more to address his SOR debts after becoming aware that they raised a \nsecurity concern.  \n \nIn 1991, Applicant took a telephone calling card and used it to make long \ndistance calls costing more than $100. This conduct constituted theft of telephone \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nservices. On January 3, 1992, he made a false sworn statement when he denied \nknowledge of anyone else who used the stolen calling card whereas Applicant provided \nthe calling card number to his roommate. On December 15, 1998, he deliberately failed \nto disclose the NJP he received in 1992 for theft of telephone services on his SF 86. On \nApril 26, 2001, Applicant made a false statement to a DSS special agent, understating \nhis culpability for the theft of telephone services in 1991. In 2004, he forged the \nsignature of a lieutenant colonel on his Request for Waiver of Tuition Assistance. On \nDecember 31, 2005, Applicant used cocaine while holding a security clearance. This \nseries of criminal acts raises serious personal conduct security concerns. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nand personal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated, and he is not eligible for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.g to 1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel working for a defense contractor. He graduated from college in 1988, and received a Civil Engineering degree. Applicant married his wife in 1988, and they have two sons, ages 19 and 15. He completed his master\u2019s degree in Aeronautical Science in 1998. Applicant was commissioned in 1988, and served in the Air Force until his retirement in November 2008. The Air Force characterized his service as honorable. Applicant had a distinguished flying career and graduated from the Air Force\u2019s Fighter Weapons School. Moreover, he was commended twice with the Distinguished Flying Cross for Heroism for flying combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He also flew combat missions during Operation Southern Watch. While in the service, Applicant possessed a top secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information. There is no evidence that he ever mishandled, compromised, or caused others to compromise classified information. In January 2007, Applicant was a lieutenant colonel on active duty assigned for four months to work with the U.S. Military Assistance Group in a U.S. Embassy in a foreign country. Shortly aft",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications on November 5, 2008 and \nJuly 23, 2009. On September 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended, Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended, and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective within DOD on September 1, \n2006. \n \nJune 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and \nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and it recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted \nor denied. \n \nOn October 9, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 19, \n2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 5, 2010, scheduling a hearing for \nMarch 25, 2010. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 31, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR factual allegations. His admissions are \nincorporated here as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, \nand having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel working for a \ndefense contractor. He graduated from college in 1988, and received a Civil \nEngineering degree. Applicant married his wife in 1988, and they have two sons, ages \n19 and 15. He completed his master\u2019s degree in Aeronautical Science in 1998. \nApplicant was commissioned in 1988, and served in the Air Force until his retirement in \nNovember 2008. The Air Force characterized his service as honorable. Applicant had a \ndistinguished flying career and graduated from the Air Force\u2019s Fighter Weapons School. \nMoreover, he was commended twice with the Distinguished Flying Cross for Heroism \nfor flying combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He also flew combat \nmissions during Operation Southern Watch. While in the service, Applicant possessed a \ntop secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information. \nThere is no evidence that he ever mishandled, compromised, or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was a lieutenant colonel on active duty assigned for \nfour months to work with the U.S. Military Assistance Group in a U.S. Embassy in a \nforeign country. Shortly after his arrival, Applicant established a sexual relationship with \na woman from the foreign country that lasted approximately three weeks. During the \nrelationship, he illegally used a U.S. Embassy car and driver to go to a resort during a \nweekend trip with another military member and two women from the foreign country. He \nprovided meals and a tip to the driver for his services.  \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant established another sexual relationship with a second \nwoman from the foreign country that lasted approximately two months. He shared his \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \napartment with the woman. After leaving the country in May 2007, he continued to have \ninfrequent telephone contact with the woman for approximately six months. Applicant \nalso admitted that in 1995, while serving in the Air Force and in temporary duty to \nanother country, he engaged in a sexual relationship with a woman from that foreign \ncountry. Applicant has had no contact with any of the women since 2007.  \n \nApplicant knew or should have known that engaging in an adulterous relationship \nwas a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and that his improper \nuse of an Embassy vehicle and driver for personal reasons was prohibited. Moreover, \nhe knew or should have known that his relationship with a foreign national placed the \nsecurity of his mission and unit at risk. He also placed himself in a vulnerable position to \nbe extorted. In February 2008, Applicant received a general officer letter of reprimand \nfor adultery, a violation of Article 134, UCMJ, and for his illegal use of the Embassy car \nand driver. Applicant also was reprimanded for paying off the driver to keep him quiet.1 \nThe letter of reprimand ended his promising career. \n \nDuring the course of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) \ninvestigation (from around September 2007 to February 2008) and until August 2008, \nApplicant was not relieved from duty and he was allowed to continue working with \nclassified information at the top secret level. Applicant\u2019s supervisors did not consider \nhim to be a security risk because of his character, performance, distinguished service \nrecord, and his full cooperation with the investigators. (AE 2) On August 27, 2008, the \nAir Force Central Adjudication Facility issued Applicant a memorandum of intent to \nrevoke his eligibility for access to classified information. The memorandum suspended \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s retirement in November 2008, \nprevented a full adjudication of the proceedings. \n \nApplicant was hired by his current employer, a defense contractor, in July 2008, \nto start working after his retirement, in November 2008. After his access to classified \ninformation was suspended, he immediately disclosed to his employer the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding the suspension. He worked full-time for his employer until \nOctober 2009, when he was placed on leave without pay pending the adjudication of his \nsecurity clearance. (AE 1) In October 2009, Applicant started working on a dual \nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration and international relations. He expects to \ngraduate in 2011. \n \nApplicant has kept his family in the dark about his misconduct and the \nsuspension of his security clearance. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his \nfamily\u2019s lack of knowledge leaves him vulnerable to possible coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. In late 2008, Applicant sought counseling from his Catholic priest. He is trying to \nrectify and strengthen his commitment to his marriage. The priest advised him not to \ndisclose to his wife his adulterous relationships in order to protect his marriage. (Tr. 71) \n \n1 Applicant provided meals and tipped the driver for his services at the time the services were performed. \nThe record evidence does not support the conclusion that Applicant attempted to obstruct justice. \nApplicant was not reprimanded for obstruction of justice, nor is that allegation made in the SOR. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant credibly and contritely accepted full responsibility for \nwhat he described as \u201chis irresponsible, selfish, and immoral behavior.\u201d He also \napologized for placing his unit and himself in a compromising position. He credibly \nstated that he will never let it happen again. He promised his behavior will never cause \nhis trustworthiness and judgment to be questioned again. Applicant highlighted his \ndistinguished Air Force service, particularly, his 20 years handling classified information \nwith no security violations, and his combat deployments when he honorably served the \nUnited States risking his life for national security and the defense of the United States. \nApplicant credibly testified that if anyone attempted to blackmail him with his \nmisconduct, he would disclose the blackmail attempt to his security officer and his wife.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Air Force supervisor at the time of the OSI investigation and his \ncurrent supervisor provided strong statements on his behalf. Both references consider \nApplicant to be honest and trustworthy. Except for the misconduct reflected on the SOR, \nhe was commended for his judgment, maturity, work ethic, and overall performance. His \nreferences recommended that he receive access to classified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \n\n \n5 \n \n \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant was an Air Force active duty lieutenant colonel when he engaged in \nthree adulterous relationships while on temporary duty to foreign countries in 1995, and \ntwice in 2007. He also improperly used an Embassy car and driver for personal \nreasons. His behavior placed the security of his mission and unit at risk. He also placed \nhimself in a vulnerable position to be blackmailed. As a result of his misconduct, his \nclearance was suspended. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n16(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations;\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in a foreign \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that \ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or \npressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group.\u201d \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), \nand 17(e) all apply, at least in part, to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s questionable \nbehavior occurred three years ago. Because he was a senior military officer, I do not \nconsider his offenses minor. Notwithstanding, there is no evidence that he has been \ninvolved in similar activity since 2007, or that he has continued his association with the \nforeign women. He is no longer in the service. \n \nApplicant credibly expressed remorse for his behavior and has learned his \nlesson. His behavior ended his promising Air Force career and subjected him to the \nsecurity clearance process. He is now clearly aware of the possible consequences of \nhis actions and what could happen if he engages in future misconduct. He \nacknowledged his behavior, obtained counseling, and has taken positive steps to \nreduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nI specifically considered that Applicant could be vulnerable to exploitation \nbecause he has not told his family about his misconduct and the suspension of his \nclearance. I also considered Applicant\u2019s 20-year-service record and track record \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures, the trust placed on him by his \nmilitary supervisors when they allowed him to continue working with classified \ninformation while under investigation, and his significant contributions to the United \nStates risking his life flying combat missions. On balance, I find that Applicant can be \ntrusted to disclose to U.S. authorities if someone attempts to extort or pressure him. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find his questionable behavior is unlikely to \nrecur, and it currently does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment.  \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior,  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the concern about sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides four conditions relating to sexual behavior that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nIn 1995, and twice in 2007, Applicant engaged in adulterous relationships while \nserving on active duty and assigned in temporary duty to foreign countries. His behavior \nconstituted a criminal offense under the UCMJ, and placed him in a vulnerable position \nto be pressured. He is still vulnerable to coercion because his family members are not \naware of his past behavior. Applicant receives credit for cooperating with Government \ninvestigators, disclosing the information to his employer, and for his candid testimony \nduring his hearing; however, that does not fully eliminate his vulnerability concerns.  \n \nApplicant was involved in high risk sexual behavior because he engaged in three \nadulterous relationships while on active duty and assigned on temporary duty to foreign \ncountries. He knew or should have known that such behavior was a violation of the \nUCMJ. Moreover, he knew or should have known that his relationship with a foreign \nnational placed the security of his mission and unit at risk. He also placed himself in a \nvulnerable position to be pressured. His sexual behavior shows a lack of judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) apply and create a concern.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply to this case. Concerning AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c), the \ngovernment cross-alleged the conduct involved in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The analysis \nand comments contained in the Personal Conduct discussions, supra, are incorporated \nunder this subheading.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s questionable behavior occurred three years ago, while he was in the \nservice, and on temporary duty. There is no evidence that he has been involved in \nsimilar behavior since 2007, or that he has continued his association with the foreign \nwomen. He is no longer in the service. \n \nApplicant credibly expressed remorse for his behavior. I believe he has learned \nhis lesson. His behavior ended his promising Air Force career and subjected him to the \npossible revocation of his security clearance. He is now clearly aware of the possible \nconsequences of his actions and what could happen if he engages in similar future \nsexual behavior. He acknowledged his behavior, obtained counseling, and has taken \npositive steps to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nI specifically considered that Applicant could be vulnerable to exploitation \nbecause he has not told his family about his misconduct and the suspension of his \nclearance. I also considered Applicant\u2019s 20-year-service record and track record \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures, the trust placed on him by his \nmilitary supervisors when they allowed him to continue working with classified \ninformation while under investigation, and his significant contributions to the United \nStates risking his life flying combat missions. On balance, I find that Applicant can be \ntrusted to disclose to U.S. authorities if someone attempts to pressure him. Considering \nthe evidence as a whole, I find his questionable behavior is unlikely to recur, and it \ncurrently does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows that after 2007, he was able to continue a normal life \nwith his family, was successful at work with the Air Force, handled classified information \nuntil August 2009, and has recently continued his advance education. These factors \nindicate that his prior questionable behavior is unlikely to recur. I also find Applicant was \ncandid during his testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), (c), and (d) partially apply to his case.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and D in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. Except for the misconduct addressed in this decision, there is no \nevidence of any other blemishes on Applicant\u2019s behavior, or that he has otherwise failed \nto follow rules and regulations, or violated security procedures.  \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his inappropriate behavior and expressed sincere \nremorse for his actions. He accepted full responsibility for his \u201cirresponsible, selfish, and \nimmoral behavior.\u201d He also apologized for placing his unit and himself in a \ncompromising position. He credibly stated that he will never let it happen again, and \nvowed his conduct will never cause his trustworthiness and judgment to be questioned \nagain.  \n \nApplicant had a distinguished 20-year career in the Air Force service. His service \nwas characterized as honorable. He handled classified information during 20 years of \nservice with no security violations. Applicant credibly testified that if anyone attempted \nto pressure him with his misconduct, he would disclose the pressure attempt to his \nsecurity officer and his wife. I find that his character, service record, and his combat \nservice provide a sufficient track record of past behavior to support a conclusion that it \nis likely that Applicant would disclose to proper authorities any attempted coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  \n \nHe has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation or duress because of his \ncooperation with Government investigators, his full disclosure to his employer, and his \ncandid participation during the DOHA security clearance process. He is considered to \nbe honest and trustworthy. Except for the misconduct on this SOR, he was commended \nfor his judgment, maturity, work ethic, and overall performance. His references \nrecommended that he receive access to classified information. \n \nOn balance, and after considering all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \npersonal conduct and sexual behavior. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence outweighs his \ntemporally remote questionable behavior. I believe he has learned from his mistakes \nand the security clearance process. He now understands what is required of him to \nmaintain his eligibility for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence \nconvinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on November 7, 2008. On July 31, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 10, 2009, Applicant requested a \ndecision on the record in lieu of a hearing. The government compiled its File of Relevant \nOctober 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nMaterial (FORM) on September 17, 2009. The FORM contained documents identified \nas Items 1 through 9. By letter dated September 22, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of \nthe FORM to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or \nobjections within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on October 8, 2009, and \nhe provided additional information in response to the FORM, which DOHA received on \nOctober 14, 2009. On October 22, 2009, the case was assigned to me for a decision. \nWithout objection, I admitted to the record Applicant\u2019s one-page response to the FORM. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains five allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the five Guideline H allegations.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered herein as \nfindings of fact.  (Item 1; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, never married, and employed as a software \nengineer/security researcher by a government contractor. In 2005, he received a \nBachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. He has been employed part-time and \nfull-time in information technology since about 2001. (Item 5.) \n \n \nOn November 7, 2008, Applicant completed and signed an e-QIP. Section 24a of \nthe e-QIP asks the following question: \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used a controlled substance, for example, \nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d (Item 5; emphasis in \noriginal.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 24a and provided additional information. \nHe stated that he used the prescription drug adderall illegally approximately six times \nfrom January 2000 to October 2008. He also stated that he used prescription drugs \ncontaining hydrocodone illegally approximately 30 times from January 2002 to October \n2008. Additionally, Applicant stated he had illegally used a prescription drug muscle \nrelaxer, not further identified, once in August 2008. (Item 5 at 28.) \n \n \nApplicant also acknowledged the illegal use of the controlled substance \nmarijuana \u201cnumerous\u201d times between January 1998 and September 2008. In response \nto Question 24a, he added the following information: \u201cI\u2019ve smoked marijuana numerous \ntimes throughout my life, but would never describe the use as chronic, more as casual. I \nwould probably average the usage out to be 1 time per month for the last 10 years \n(probably less).\u201d (Item 5 at 28.) \n \n \nIn his response to Question 24a, Applicant also reported illegal use of the \ncontrolled substance cocaine approximately 20 times between January 2001 and \nAugust 2007. He added the following information: \u201cI\u2019m going with a higher number than \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntimes I can actually recall. I first tried [c]ocaine in college and have done it a few times \nsince then.\u201d (Item 5 at 28-29.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed about his illegal drug use by an authorized investigator \nfrom the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 30, 2008. In the \ninterview, as summarized by the investigator, Applicant confirmed the drug usage he \nhad listed on his e-QIP in response to Question 24a. He denied purchasing any of the \nprescription drugs he used illegally. He stated that the drugs were provided to him by \nfriends in social settings. He reported that adderall made him \u201cstay awake, hyper and \njittery\u201d; that he used hydrocodone about twice a year in social settings \u201cto have fun and \nfeel good\u201d and that it made him \u201cfeel great\u201d; and that his one-time use of a muscle \nrelaxer in August 2008 was experimental and \u201cdid nothing for him and had no effect on \nhim.\u201d (Item 6 at 3-4.) \n \n \nIn the interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant also confirmed that he \nsmoked marijuana and snorted cocaine, as listed in his responses to Question 24a. He \ndenied any dependency on illegal drugs, any treatment for drug abuse, and ever testing \npositive for illegal drug use. He stated that his family and friends knew of his illegal drug \nuse. He claimed that his illegal drug use had no effect on his personal life or \nprofessional career. He also stated he had no intention of using illegal drugs in the \nfuture. In a sworn and notarized response to DOHA interrogatories on March 25, 2009, \nApplicant confirmed that the investigator\u2019s summary of their interview on December 30, \n2008, accurately reflected the information he had provided to the investigator during the \ninterview. (Item 6, 3-6.) \n \n \nI take administrative notice that the controlled substances marijuana and cocaine \nhave been identified by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) as commonly \nabused drugs. NIDA lists the intoxication effects of marijuana as \u201ceuphoria, slowed \nthinking and reaction time, confusion, impaired balance and coordination/cough, \nfrequent respiratory infections; impaired memory and learning; increased heart rate, \nanxiety; panic attacks; tolerance, addiction.\u201d NIDA identifies cocaine as a stimulant and \nlists the following intoxication effects and potential health consequences for those who \nuse cocaine: \u201crapid breathing/tremor, loss of coordination; irritability, anxiousness, \nrestlessness, delirium, panic, paranoia, impulsive behavior, aggressiveness, tolerance, \naddiction, psychosis.\u201d (Item 7 at 1-2.) \n \n \nI also take administrative notice that the stimulant adderall is prescribed for use \nin treating the hyperactivity condition known as attention-deficit disorder and that \nhydrocodone is an opiate compound prescribed to suppress coughs and to alleviate \nmoderate to moderately severe pain. The misuse of these prescription drugs can have \nsevere or fatal consequences. (Item 8; Item 9.) \n \n \n \nApplicant provided the following statement in response to the FORM: \n \n \nI feel that I am an excellent candidate for [a] security clearance and \nwould like reconsideration. I deal not only with [deleted] trade secrets, but \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthose of many other large companies and governments on a daily basis. \nHandling of secure information is a large part of my job and requires me to \nbe an extremely trustworthy individual. I can provide multiple character \nreferences which can testify to my sincerity regarding national, \ninternational and corporate security practices. Although my drug history \nmay be beyond what you consider reasonable, I have never had a \nproblem with substance abuse of any kind, nor intend to experiment in the \nfuture. I feel that I could be of great assistance to the United States \ngovernment and help secure our technological infrastructure if given this \nclearance. In closing, I would like to request a re-examination of my case. \n \n(Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM at 1.) \n \n                       \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n5 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG  \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe record shows that Applicant admitted the illegal use of marijuana, with \nvarying frequency, for approximately 10\u00bd years, from January 1998 to at least \nSeptember 2008. He admitted the illegal use of cocaine, with varying frequency, for \napproximately 6\u00bd years, from approximately January 2001 to at least August 2007. \nFrom January 2000 to at least October 2008, he used the prescription drug adderall, \nwithout a prescription, From January 2002 to at least October 2008, he used the \nprescription drug hydrocodone, without a prescription. He also used a muscle relaxer \ndrug without a prescription once in August 2008.   \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant, who is now 27 years old, used multiple \ndrugs illegally and abused prescription drugs during a span of over ten years. This \nconduct occurred during his adolescence and throughout his college years. It continued \n\n \n6 \n \n \neven after he graduated from college in 2005, and after he began his professional career. \nAs recently as August 2008, as a 26-year-old adult, he experimented with and used a \nprescription muscle relaxer drug illegally. This conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. It also raises security concerns about his ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use and illegal use of prescription drugs raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(c). AG \u00b6 25(a) reads: \u201cany drug abuse [as defined at AG \u00b6 24(b)].\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c) \nreads: \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, \nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \n \nTwo Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation. If Applicant demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used, abstaining from drug use for an \nappropriate period, or signing a statement of intent with the automatic revocation of his \nsecurity clearance for any violation, then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be applicable.  \n \nFrom 1998 to 2008, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use was on-going and frequent. The \nrecord shows that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use and abuse of prescription drugs \ncontinued until September and October of 2008, a short time before he completed and \nsigned his e-QIP in November 2008. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use and prescription drug \nabuse was a long-term lifestyle choice.  \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by an authorized OPM investigator in December \n2008, he asserted that he had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. However, \nhe provided no information to demonstrate his intent: he failed to provide evidence that \nhe had abstained from drug use for an appropriate period; that he had disassociated \nfrom those with whom he had used drugs in the past; or that he had changed his \nconduct to avoid environments where drugs are used. Moreover, he failed to provide a \nsigned statement of intent with an automatic revocation of his security clearance for any \nfuture illegal drug use or abuse of prescription drugs. Absent evidence of demonstrated \nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not \napply in mitigation to the security concerns raised by the facts in Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant was candid in \nrevealing his drug abuse when he completed his e-QIP, he failed to demonstrate that he \nwould not return to drug use in the future. In his statement in response to the FORM, he \nfailed to recognize or acknowledge that his long-term drug use may have had some \ndeleterious effects on his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. Additionally, while he \nexpressed an intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, he failed to identify specific \nactions to demonstrate his intent. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his prolonged \nand relatively recent involvement with illegal drugs and the illegal use of prescription \ndrugs. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.: Against Applicant \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEdward O.

On November 23, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June\n21, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s\n\n1Applicant proffers an additional argument by asserting that there is no reasonable basis for concluding that\nallowing Applicant\u2019s access to classified information poses an imminent threat to the national interest.  He cites the\nDirective \u00b6 6.4, for the proposition that clearance suspension is authorized where an imminent threat to the national\ninterest is established.  Applicant\u2019s argument is misplaced.  Clearance suspension pending the normal security clearance\nadjudication process is a separate determination that is not applicable to this case.  Thus, the standard of imminent threat\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nApplicant failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns, and\nwhether the Judge misapplied the whole person factors.  For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings: Applicant is 20 years old.  He has been cited for\nthree driving infractions.  In December 2007, at the age of 17, he was cited for driving past curfew.\nIn February 2008, he was cited for unsafe turn signal, obstructed view and not having a driver\u2019s\nlicense in his possession.  In May 2008, Applicant was cited for speeding.  Applicant used marijuana\ntwo or three times between December 2007 and January 2008.  He also used cocaine and ecstasy\non one occasion in January 2008.  He tested positive for illegal drugs during a drug screening test\nconducted by his probation office in January 2008.  Applicant attributed his illegal drug use to peer\npressure.  He no longer associates with any drug users.  In August 2005, Applicant was arrested for\ngrand theft from person.  Applicant was accused of taking a $5 bill off of a person standing in line\nin front of him at a store.  He was arrested and taken to jail.  He was issued a citation and required\nto appear in court.  Unintentionally, he missed his court date and a warrant was issued for his arrest.\nThe court ultimately dismissed the case.  In September 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith felony burglary.  Applicant stole a bottle of alcohol (liquor) from a department store with a\nfriend, who stole additional items.  Applicant was arrested and taken to jail.  He was placed on\nsupervised probation for one year, required to complete of 80 hours of community service and 20\nhours of either AA or NA meetings.  Applicant testified that he currently has a girlfriend, who has\nkept him on the straight and narrow path for the past two years.  He feels that she has brought out\nthe best in him and he is a completely changed person.  He recently purchased a house.  Applicant\ncurrently consumes alcohol, and is currently breaking the law.  He knows that it is illegal for him\nto consume alcohol in the state, as he is under the legal age limit to consume alcoholic beverages.\nThe Judge concluded that the totality of the evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability,\nand untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Furthermore, although it is not alleged,\nApplicant is consuming alcohol while he is still under the legal age to do so in the state of his\nresidence.  Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nthat is sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case.  Under the whole-person concept, the totality\nof the conduct set forth under all the guidelines indicates that Applicant may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.  \n \nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision is not supported by the record\nevidence and that Applicant established mitigation of the government\u2019s concerns1.  He states that\n\nis not applicable to this case. \n \n2Included with Applicant\u2019s appeal brief was a Motion to Augment Record, wherein Applicant requested the\nBoard to consider evidence relating to his psychiatric treatment.  In keeping with the Directive\u2019s prohibition against\nconsidering matters not part of the record, the motion is denied. \n \nthe conduct that the Judge cited as a basis for her decision can be attributed to his young age and\ninexperience.  He states his unwillingness to jeopardize his current position, his disassociation from\nthe harmful influences that contributed to his past indiscretions, and the positive influences\nrepresented by his girlfriend, his job and his new home.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not establish\nerror on the part of the Judge.\nApplicant cites his commitment to weekly psychiatric treatment as an additional factor which\nrenders the Judge\u2019s clearance decision arbitrary and capricious.  The evidence of psychiatric\ntreatment is new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.2\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  She adequately discussed why the disqualifying conduct established under Guidelines E,\nH, and J was not mitigated.  \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\n\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

RA\u2019ANAN      \nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s brief raises the issue of whether the Judge adequately\naddressed questions of recency and maturity, I believe it raises a fair point.  Two years have passed\nsince the last misconduct alleged in the SOR (speeding five miles an hour over the speed limit) and\nApplicant is twenty-years-old.  It would have been appropriate for the Judge to address in some\ndetail the applicability of Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(3), 2(a)(4), 2(a)(9), 2(e)(1), 2(e)(5), 17(c),\n26(a), 26(b), 32(a) and/or 32(d) in her decision.

(Government 1.)  On November 23, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines E, H and J for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, \u201cSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\u201d\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\u201d (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \n The Applicant responded to the SOR on December 9, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on January 22, 2010.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 2, 2010,\nscheduling the hearing for April 15, 2010.  At the hearing the Government presented\nfour exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 4, which were admitted without\nobjection.  The Applicant presented one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, that\nwas admitted without objection.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official\n\n2\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on April 27, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 20 years old and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by\na defense contractor as an Engineer Technician, and is applying for a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\n  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because engaged in conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations.    \nThe Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  (Tr. p. 9.)  The Applicant began working for his current employer in June\n2008.  Since then he has received two pay increases for his work performance.  He got\nthe job through a family friend, in lieu of joining the military.\nThe Applicant has been cited for three driving infractions.  In December 2007, six\nmonths before he was hired by his current employer, he was cited for Driving Past\nCurfew.  The Applicant stated that he was seventeen years old at the time.  He was\nspending the night at a friend\u2019s house and got up in the middle of the night to drive\nhome to pick up his work clothes.  A police officer pulled him over.  \nA few months later, in February 2008, he was cited for (1) Unsafe Left Hand Turn\n(2) Obstructed View, (3) Not in Possession of Driver\u2019s License, and (4) Failure to Signal.\nThe Applicant explained that it was raining, he was turning right, and his blinker was not\nworking.  The police pulled him over and asked why his blinker was not on.  The\nApplicant told the officer that his blinker was out, but the officer told him that he should\nhave used his hand signals to make the turn.  The officer also noticed air freshener\nhanging on the Applicant\u2019s rear view mirror that was obstructing the Applicant\u2019s view.  In\naddition, the Applicant did not have his driver\u2019s license in his possession at the time,\nbecause he was wearing basketball shorts.  (Tr. p. 42.)\nThree months later, in May 2008, the Applicant was cited for speeding and was\nfined.  The Applicant explained that he was going to the store to get some medicine for\nhis little brother.  He was doing 60 miles per hour in a 55 mile speed limit.     \nSubparagraphs 1(a) and 1(b) will be discussed under Paragraph 3, below.\n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted the allegation set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\n(Tr. pp 8 - 9). The Applicant used marijuana two or three times between December\n2007 and January 2008.  He testified that he has no intention of ever using marijuana\nagain.  He also used cocaine and ecstasy on one occasion on the same day in January\n2008.  He tested positive for illegal drugs during a drug screening test by his probation\nofficer in January 2008.  He attributes his illegal drug use to peer pressure.  He no\nlonger associates with any drug users. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal activities. \nThe Applicant admitted the allegation set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  In August 2005, the Applicant was arrested for Grand\nTheft from Person.  He explained the circumstances of this arrest.  He was fifteen years\nold at the time.  He and his friends were waiting in line for ice cream.  The person in\nfront of them had a $5.00 bill showing.  Applicant claims that his friend took the $5.00\nbill and ran.  The police arrived, and the Applicant told the officer that he did not know\nwho took the money.  The Applicant was instructed to empty his pockets and he had a\n$5.00 bill.  Applicant believes that he upset the officer because he was not listening to\nhim.  Applicant was accused of stealing the money, and was arrested and taken to jail.\nApplicant was issued a citation and required to appear in court.  Unintentionally, he\nmissed his court date and a warrant was issued for his arrest.  The court ultimately\ndismissed the case.  (Tr. pp. 34 - 37.)   \nIn September 2007, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Burglary, a\nfelony.  He explained the circumstances of this arrest.  Applicant and a friend went into\na department store to steal.  The Applicant took a bottle of alcohol, his friend took some\nclothes, alcohol and candy.  They were stopped by a security guard as they were\nwalking out of the door.  They tried to run, but were caught.  The police were called and\nthe Applicant was arrested and taken to jail.  The Applicant was placed on supervised\nprobation for one year, complete 80 hours of community service, and attend 20 hours of\neither Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  Applicant attributes\nhis bad conduct to hanging around the wrong crowd.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 4.)  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s General Manager; mother; a\nmentor and good friend, who is retired military; another friend; and his grandmother,\nindicate that he is considered responsible, trustworthy, professional, and a  man of\nintegrity.  He is said to be a hard worker with  strong leadership qualities.  He is\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\nThe Applicant testified that he currently has a girlfriend, who has kept him for the\npast two years on the straight and narrow path.  Although she did not testify, she was\npresent at the hearing for moral support.  The Applicant states that she has brought out\nthe best in him and he has become a completely changed person.  He recently\n\n4\npurchased a house.  Although alcohol consumption is not alleged, the Applicant\ncurrently consumes alcohol, and is currently breaking the law.  He knows that it is illegal\nfor him to consume alcohol in the state, as he is under the legal age limit to consume\nalcoholic beverages.  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in personal conduct, drug involvement, and criminal conduct\nthat demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in poor judgment and questionable conduct, (Guideline E), has a\nhistory of drug involvement (Guideline H), and criminal conduct (Guideline J).  The\ntotality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on\nthe part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I\nconclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case\nunder Guidelines E, H and J of the SOR.  \n\n7\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant, as young as he is, has a recent history of\nquestionable judgment, illegal drug use, and criminal conduct.  Just several months\nbefore being hired by his current employer, he used illegal drugs, including marijuana,\ncocaine and ecstasy.  He also tested positive for illegal drugs during a drug screening\ntest by his probation officer.  He was arrested and convicted of Burglary just a year\nbefore starting his employment with a defense contractor.  He has also had three traffic\nviolations within the last two years.  Furthermore, although it is not alleged, he is\nconsuming alcohol when he is under the legal age to do so in this state.  Given this\nhistory, he has not demonstrated the level of maturity required to have access to\nclassified information.  \n  \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16.(c) credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as\na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable.  Consequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct.  \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25.(a) any drug\nabuse, and 25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia apply.\nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nUnder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Disqualifying Conditions 31.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses, and 31.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.   \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole-person assessment of poor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).     \n\n8\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 3: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 19, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 27, 2010, after two hearings,\nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant  appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was given a fair and\nimpartial hearing, and whether the Judge\u2019s application of mitigating conditions and whole-person\nfactors was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we\naffirm the Judge\u2019s adverse decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 49 years old and has\nheld a security clearance since 1998.  In 1979, when Applicant was about 17 years old, he was\narrested and charged with petit larceny and possession of burglary tools after he and some friends\nsiphoned gasoline from a truck.  The owner of the truck dropped the charges.  Applicant believed\nhis record was expunged, although he did not verify that had actually happened.  Applicant\u2019s parents\ncame to live with him in 1987, and Applicant cared for his father until the father\u2019s death in 1992.\nApplicant also cared for his mother until she moved into a nursing home in 2001.  From 1992 until\n2001, Applicant gave his mother her medication.  After a heart attack in 1996, Applicant was\nprescribed and took Oxycodone until his prescription expired.  In 1998, Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s\ncondition worsened.  On occasion between 1998 and 2001, Applicant took his mother\u2019s prescription\npain killer, Percocet, because he was under stress.  Applicant estimated that he took her medication\nabout 20 times.  Applicant knew that his use of her prescription medication was illegal, and he held\na security clearance while he did so.  In February 2004, Applicant stole a blank prescription form\nfrom his doctor\u2019s desk.  He made copies of the form and forged his doctor\u2019s name to obtain 100\nOxycodone pills per month for approximately 21 months.  Applicant held a Top Secret security\nclearance at that time.  In December 2005, Applicant attempted to obtain 200 Oxycodone pills\ninstead of 100.  Applicant believes the pharmacist contacted the police and the doctor.  In 2006,\nApplicant was arrested and charged in Federal Court with obtaining Oxycodone by fraud.  He\npleaded guilty and was placed on probation for three years.  Applicant complied with the terms of\nthe probation, including attending drug counseling and seeing a psychiatrist.  Applicant believes he\nwent through withdrawal when he stopped taking the pills, although he was never diagnosed as\nbeing physically dependent on the drug.  Applicant\u2019s probation ended in December 2008, although\nhe is still prohibited from purchasing a weapon or voting.  Based on testimony elicited at the hearing\nof September 8, 2010, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add an allegation of falsification\nin connection with Applicant\u2019s security clearance application of 2002, for failure to disclose his\nillegal use of his mother\u2019s pain medication.  Applicant denied that his failure to disclose the\ninformation was intentional or deliberate.  The Judge found Applicant\u2019s explanation not to be\ncredible and found against him in that regard.  In the security clearance application Applicant\ncompleted in March 2008, he denied illegal use of drugs while possessing a security clearance.  With\nregard to the 2008 application, the Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor, concluding that he provided\nsufficient information elsewhere on the application to put the government on notice of his drug use\n\n3\nwhile he held a security clearance.  Applicant is regarded highly by colleagues and supervisors and\nreceives high performance ratings at work.\nApplicant contends that he was denied a fair and impartial hearing because the Judge\n\u201cabandoned her role as Judge and assumed a role as co-counsel to the Government attorney. . .\u201d\nAppeal Brief at 6-7.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and\nthe appealing party has a heavy burden when seeking to overcome that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 08-01306 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).  The issue is whether the Judge acted in a manner\nthat would lead a reasonable person to question his or her fairness and impartiality.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 03-24632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).  In the case before us now, Applicant points to several\ninstances when the Judge interrupted Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination to ask for additional\ninformation from Applicant.  A Judge may question any witness to clarify ambiguities, or to better\nunderstand the evidence before him or her.  See ISCR Case No. 94-1055 at 2 (App Bd. May 8,\n1996).  In this case the Judge chose to clarify Applicant\u2019s testimony to a significant extent during\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s cross-examination.  (She also asked several questions during Applicant\u2019s\ncounsel\u2019s examination.)  The Judge\u2019s actions do not rebut the presumption that the Judge decided\nthe case on the basis of the evidence before her.  Applicant also relies on the fact that several of his\nobjections were over-ruled to buttress his case for bias.  The argument is unpersuasive.  The Judge\u2019s\nrulings in this record are not evidence of bias.  The Board need not agree with the substance of each\nruling to conclude that they do not indicate bias.   \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant maintains that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline\nJ and Guideline E and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his\nevidence of mitigation.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record\nevidence, and there is no requirement that the Judge mention or discuss every piece of record\nevidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16,\n2005).  Applicant relies on the speed of the Judge\u2019s final decision as evidence that she did not\nconsider all the record evidence.  The Board finds that argument unpersuasive.  The second hearing\ntranscript is stamped as received at DOHA on October 20, 2010.  The Judge\u2019s decision is dated\nOctober 27, 2010.  There is no basis to conclude that this is too fast.  Furthermore, the Judge was\nat the hearing; she did not need to wait for the transcript before starting the process of preparing a\ndecision.  Applicant admitted four of the SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted to\nApplicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those allegations.  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular\nfacts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge\nto make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06540 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 19, 2010).\n\n4\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the Guideline J and Guideline E allegations against him and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  Decision at 7-10.  The Judge\nreasonably explained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Id.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his\ndecision,  \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01306 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009). The issue is whether the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to question his or her fairness and impartiality. See ISCR Case No. 03-24632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). In the case before us now, Applicant points to several instances when the Judge interrupted Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination to ask for additional information from Applicant. A Judge may question any witness to clarify ambiguities, or to better understand the evidence before him or her. See ISCR Case No. 94-1055 at 2 (App Bd. May 8, 1996). In this case the Judge chose to clarify Applicant\u2019s testimony to a significant extent during Department Counsel\u2019s cross-examination. (She also asked several questions during Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s examination.) The Judge\u2019s actions do not rebut the presumption that the Judge decided the case on the basis of the evidence before her. Applicant also relies on the fact that several of his objections were over-ruled to buttress his case for bias. The argument is unpersuasive. The Judge\u2019s rulings in this record are not evidence of bias. The Board need not agree with the substance of each ruling to conclude that they do not indicate bias. Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Applicant maintains that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline J and Guideline E and that the Judge either di",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nJ, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn May 19, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J \nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 11, 2010, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 8, \n2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 12, 2010, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on September 8, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 27, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthrough 8. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through V, which were admitted without objections. Applicant and a witness \ntestified. During the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR to add an \nallegation.1 The motion was granted and the hearing was postponed until October 18, \n2010, to afford Applicant proper notice. The hearing resumed as scheduled. Applicant \nprovided AE W, which was admitted without objection. DOHA received the original \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on September 15, 2010 and the final hearing transcript on \nOctober 20, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.d, and 2.e. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old college graduate. He has worked for the same federal \ncontractor since 1997 and has held a security clearance since 1998. His security \nclearance was upgraded to Top Secret in 2003. He married in 2002 and has two \nstepchildren ages 24 and 19.2  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 1979 and charged with petit larceny and possession of \nburglary tools. He and some friends siphoned gasoline from a truck. The owner of the \ntruck dropped the charges. He was about 17 years old at the time.  Applicant believed \nhis record was expunged, although he did not take any affirmative action to verify if that \nactually happened.3  \n \n \nIn 1987, Applicant\u2019s parents came to live with him. His father had medical \nproblems and could no longer work. His mother also had medical problems. Applicant \ncared for his father until he passed away in 1992. He cared for his mother until she \nmoved into a nursing home in 2001. Applicant did not have any assistance in caring for \nhis ailing parents. From 1992 to 2001, he was responsible for giving his mother her \nmedicine. In 1996, Applicant had a heart attack. He was prescribed and took \nOxycodone. He took off from work for several weeks, but continued to care for his \nmother. His prescription expired. In 1998, his mother\u2019s condition worsened. At this time, \nApplicant began taking his mother\u2019s prescription pain killer, Percocet. He did not \nremember exactly how many times he took her pain killers, but estimated that it was \nabout 20 times from 1998 to 2001. He used it on the weekends. He explained he was \nunder a great deal of stress at the time and he used the drug to \u201ctake the edge off.\u201d He \nknew that he was not authorized or prescribed to take the medication and that his \n \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the amended SOR. HE II is the answer to the amended SOR.  \n \n2 Tr. 10-11, 32, 54. \n \n3 Tr. 33, 57-62. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nactions were illegal. He held a security clearance when he illegally used his mother\u2019s \ndrug. After his mother moved into a nursing home he no longer took her medicine.4 \n \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant stole a blank prescription form from his doctor\u2019s \ndesk. He made copies of the blank prescription. On approximately 21 different \noccasions he forged his doctor\u2019s name and prescribed himself 100 Oxycodone pills. He \ndid this on a monthly basis for approximately 21 months. Each month he presented the \nfraudulent prescription to the pharmacist who filled it for him. He then used the 100 \nOxycodone pills over the month and then he would repeat the action. Applicant held a \nTop Secret security clearance at the time and had access to classified information. In \nDecember 2005, he attempted to present the forged prescription for Oxycodone to the \npharmacist and instead of writing it for 100 pills, as he had done in the past, he wrote it \nfor 200 pills. The pharmacist refused to fill the prescription. Applicant believes the \npharmacist contacted the police and the doctor.5  \n \nApplicant illegally used Oxycodone from February 2004 to January 2006. He \nexplained he took several pills a day after work to \u201cwind down.\u201d He used them because \nof stress. He did not take them before or during work. He tried stopping, but it was \neasier to get more pills and continue to use them. He knew he was taking a controlled \nsubstance without a prescription while he held a security clearance. He thought of his \nactions as a victimless crime. When he stopped taking the drug, he believed he went \nthrough withdrawal. He was never diagnosed as being physically dependent on the \ndrug. He never missed work due to his use or from withdrawal.6 \n \nIn 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged in Federal Court with one count of \nobtaining Oxycodone by fraud. He pleaded guilty and was placed on probation for three \nyears. He was required to attend drug counseling and see a psychiatrist as part of the \nterms of his probation. He complied with the terms of the probation and it terminated \nearly in December 2008. Due to his felony conviction, Applicant is restricted from \npurchasing a weapon and his voting rights were terminated.7  \n \nApplicant was asked by Department Counsel the following question. \n \nQ: When you were using your mother\u2019s Percocet you knew that you were doing \nthat illegally. Correct? \n \nA: Yes. \n \n \n4 Tr. 35-48, 63-79; I will not consider Applicant\u2019s illegal use of his mother\u2019s prescription drug for \ndisqualifying purposes, but will consider it when analyzing the \u201cwhole-person.\u201d \n \n5 Tr. 79-91. \n \n6 Tr. 50, 85, 87-89. \n \n7 Tr. 34, 62, 91-95. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on November 14, \n2002. Question 27 asked since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, \nhad Applicant illegally used any controlled substance or prescription drug. Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d even though he illegally used his mother\u2019s Percocet from 1998 to 2001. \nAt his initial hearing, Applicant agreed that his answer to Question 27 was incorrect. He \nstated that he did not recall answering this question on the SCA. He further stated: \u201cI \ndon\u2019t know if I deliberately did it. But at that time, like I said, I didn\u2019t realize, I didn\u2019t \nrealize I was doing something illegal.\u201d8 This contradicts his earlier testimony in the \nhearing acknowledging he knew taking his mother\u2019s Percocet was illegal.9  \n \nDepartment Counsel asked another question and Applicant responded as \nfollows: \n \nQ: The question was, knowing that you took your mother\u2019s Percocet, from \n1998 to 2001 that would have been about approximately a year before you \ncompleted that Security Clearance Application that\u2019s in front of you, when \nyou answered \u201cno\u201d to that question, you deliberately falsified that \nquestion?  \n \nA: Yes. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR during the hearing to add an allegation \nof falsification regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose he had been illegally using his \nmother\u2019s prescription for Percocet approximately 20 times over a three year period. \nApplicant subsequently denied the allegation in his answer to the amended SOR. He \nstated in his answer to the amended SOR the following:  \n \nI deny this allegation as written. I did not deliberately fail to disclose my \nuse of a prescription drug. It is my belief that eight years ago when I \noriginally answered question number 27, I had answered it based on not \nreading the entire question thoroughly. I saw a list of illegal drugs and \nimmediately knew that I had not used any of the illegal drugs listed and \nanswered the question based on what I had read. As such, this was an \nunintentional mistake that occurred under unique circumstances and \nshould not cast doubt upon my reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment.10  \n \n \nAt his October 18, 2010, hearing, Applicant affirmed that his failure to disclose \nhis prior illegal use of a prescription drug was not deliberate. He stated he did not know \nwhat he was thinking when he answered the question eight years ago. He stated he \n \n8 Tr. 100. \n \n9 Tr. 96-102. \n \n10 Answer to Amended SOR. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n\u201cmight have just heard the question say marijuana or cocaine.\u201d11 He explained that he \noverlooked the last line that asked him about illegal use of prescription drugs. He also \nexplained he is a diabetic and he had a late breakfast and was confused. He stated he \nwas unaware that he would be required to answer questions about his 2002 SCA and \nthought he would only have to respond to the 2008 SCA issues. He denied he \ndeliberately lied on his 2002 SCA.12 After considering all of the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s inconsistent answers, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible and that \nApplicant deliberately and intentionally falsified his 2002 SCA.  \n \n \nApplicant completed another SCA on March 26, 2008. In response to Question \n23.a, he disclosed his felony conviction. In response to Question 23.d, he disclosed that \nthe conviction was related to drugs. In the explanation section, he disclosed the \nspecifics of the charge and sentence. He also provided under the comments section \nadditional information. In response to Question 24.a, he disclosed his illegal use of a \ncontrolled substance, Percocet, and provided the dates he used it. He did not disclose \nin response to Question 24.b that he used the controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. Question 26 asked if he had ever been granted a security clearance \nand he answered \u201cyes\u201d and provided the date of his prior investigation and that he had \nbeen granted a Top Secret security clearance.13 There is sufficient information provided \nby Applicant to put the Government on notice that he held a security clearance during \nthe time he used a controlled substance in the past seven years. After considering all of \nthe evidence, I find Applicant did not intentionally and deliberately fail to disclose on his \n2008 SCA that he illegally used a controlled substance while holding a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant was prescribed Percocet in 2007 by his doctor when he broke his wrist. \nHe notified his probation officer. He took the pills as prescribed.14  \n \n \nA witness testified on behalf of Applicant. The witness holds a security clearance. \nHe and Applicant have done volunteer work together. He has not worked with Applicant. \nHe had frequent contact with him from January 2009 to June 2009. He is aware of \nApplicant\u2019s felony conviction and believes he is successfully rehabilitated. He does not \nhave any reservations about Applicant holding a security clearance.15  \n \n \nI have considered all of the letters of recommendation, letter of appreciation, \ncredit reports, certificates of completion, documents from Applicant\u2019s probation, \n \n11 Tr. II page 7. \n \n12 Tr. II page 7-8. \n \n13 Tr. 102-106; GE 1. \n \n14 Tr. 48. \n \n15 Tr. 18-30. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nnegative drugs screen results, performance evaluations, and statement of intent to \nnever use drugs in the future subject to automatic revocation of security clearance.16 \n \n \nApplicant is considered a loyal, hardworking, and honest employee. He is helpful \nand resourceful. He is professional and courteous. He is held in high regard by his \ncolleagues and supervisors. He earned ratings of \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d on his \nperformance appraisals.17 \n \n \nApplicant stated he realized he made a mistake. He has gone through treatment \nand is now aware of other options to relieve stress. He explained that he can be trusted \nbecause he is now 48 years old and has a family and responsibilities. He has not told \nhis stepchildren about his offense.18 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n16 AE A-W. \n \n17 Id. \n \n18 Tr. 51-52. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by an applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 30 and especially considered: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of one count of obtaining Oxycodone by fraud, a felony. \nHe pleaded guilty and was placed on probation. Applicant stole a blank prescription \nform from his doctor. He then copied the prescription form and forged his doctor\u2019s \nsignature on at least 21 occasions. He presented the forged document to the \npharmacist and fraudulently obtained the controlled substance at least 21 times. He \nillegally used the controlled substance from 2004 to 2005. I find both of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and especially considered the following: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nIn 1979 Applicant was arrested and charged with petit larceny and possession of \nburglary tools. He was 17 years old at the time and he and his friends attempted to \nsiphon gas from car gas tanks. The charges were later dropped. Applicant\u2019s age and \nmaturity, at the time, are a mitigating factor. I find sufficient time has elapsed to \nconclude that this type of offense is unlikely to recur and AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant stole a blank prescription form from his doctor, forged her \nname, and fraudulently presented the prescription to the pharmacist. He did this at least \n21 times over about a two year period. He did not stop until he got caught. When \nquestioned why he used the drug, he said it was to \u201ctake the edge off.\u201d He was not \ntaking them for pain. He was using them recreationally.   \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of a felony. He has demonstrated a pattern of \nmisconduct by forging his doctor\u2019s signature and fraudulently presenting a prescription \nto the pharmacist on at least 21 separate occasions. He served about two years of \nprobation and completed its terms. It has been less than two years since Applicant was \nreleased from probation. The offense he committed is serious and the surrounding \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current trustworthiness and good judgment. I find not \nenough time has elapsed since the termination of the probation and this serious offense \ndid not happen under unusual circumstances. His actions were repeated over a \nsignificant period of time. His actions cast doubt on his trustworthiness and good \njudgment. I find AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply to these facts.  \n \n \nApplicant provided supportive character letters. His employment record appears \nto be very good. He believes he has learned from his mistakes and now knows there \nare other ways to relieve stress. He completed his probation. Applicant has a long and \nestablished pattern of misconduct beginning in 1998 through 2006 when he was \narrested. His offenses involved acts of moral turpitude that specifically relate to his \ntrustworthiness. He first testified that he knew it was illegal to use his mother\u2019s drugs. \nHowever, in his second hearing he testified that he did not know his actions were illegal \nwhen he completed his 2002 SCA. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent testimony lacks credibility. \nApplicant attempted to minimize his criminal involvement when taking his mother\u2019s \ndrugs. I find there is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation and AG \u00b6 32(d) \ndoes not apply.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole. Supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant used a controlled substance that was not prescribed to him. \nHe stole his doctor\u2019s blank prescription form and repeatedly forged her name, and \nrepeatedly and fraudulently obtained controlled substances. His conduct spanned at \nleast 21 months. He was illegally using about 100 pills a month of the controlled \nsubstance. His actions were discovered when he attempted to write a prescription for \n200 pills. These are crimes of opportunity involving acts of moral turpitude. Applicant \nheld a security clearance when he was involved in this misconduct. Applicant \nintentionally and deliberately falsified his 2002 SCA when he failed to disclose he was \nillegally using his mother\u2019s prescribed drug. Applicant\u2019s stepchildren are unaware of his \ncriminal conduct. Concealment of his personal conduct creates a vulnerability that may \naffect his personal, professional, and community standing. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I \nhave considered all of them under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) the individual made a prompt, good-faith efforts to correct he omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened  under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of only one offense. However, his pattern of misconduct \nis significant. It began when he started taking his mother\u2019s prescribed drug in 1998 and \ndid not stop until 2006 when he was caught after forging his doctor\u2019s signature and \nfraudulently obtaining a prescribed drug. Each time Applicant forged his doctor\u2019s \nsignature, took it to the pharmacist, obtained the prescription drug and then used it, he \nmade a knowing and conscious decision to commit a criminal act. He did this on at least \n21 different occasions over a two-year period. He was illegally consuming \napproximately 100 pills a month. He stated he believed his conduct was a victimless \ncrime. Applicant\u2019s actions are not minor or infrequent, and they cast serious doubts on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant falsified his 2002 SCA when he failed to disclose his illegal use of a \nprescription drug. Applicant first testified that he knew when he took his mother\u2019s pills \nand used them it was illegal. He then changed his testimony and said he did not know \nhis actions were illegal. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent testimony was not credible. I conclude \nthat his failure to disclose this information was intentional and deliberate.  \n \n \nI find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant did not correct his 2002 \nSCA before being confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. His long-term \npattern of misconduct of fraudulently obtaining controlled substances and illegally using \nthem over an extended period of time is not minor and continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. It has only \nbeen two years since Applicant was released from probation for a serious felony \nconviction. His indication that he used the drugs due to stress is a cause of concern. His \nexplanation that he used the drugs to relax after work is also a cause of concern. \nAlthough he may have found other outlets for stress relief, I am not convinced his \nconduct is unlikely to recur. I find AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. Applicant acknowledged \n\n \n11 \n \n \nhe made mistakes. However, his lack of candor and credibility when testifying raise \ndoubts whether he has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. I find AG \u00b6 17(e) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant was a mature man when he decided to steal his doctor\u2019s prescription form and \nforge her signature. His action of repeatedly and fraudulently obtaining a controlled \nsubstance continues to raises doubts about his trustworthiness and good judgment. \nDuring two separate periods of his life, he inappropriately obtained controlled \nsubstances and used them repeatedly, once when he took his mother\u2019s medication and \nused them from 1998 to 2001, and three years later when he fraudulently obtained them \nover a 21-month period. He stopped taking his mother\u2019s pills because they were no \nlonger readily available when she moved into a nursing home. Applicant was entrusted \nto take care of his mother and provide her medication. He abused the trust by taking \nsome of her pills. This conduct is not alleged, but it shows Applicant\u2019s continuing pattern \nof misconduct. He then abused his doctor\u2019s trust by taking her prescription form. His \ntestimony regarding his failure to disclose his illegal use of his mother\u2019s prescription \ndrug was inconsistent and not believable. Applicant has failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines \nfor Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Rigney, Esq.    \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows Applicant is a\nformer federal employee who has a 30-year history of drug abuse (marijuana), much of\nit taking place while he held a security clearance. He made deliberately false statements\nin 2004, when he denied using illegal drugs in response to questions on a security\nclearance application. His drug abuse came to light in 2006, when he tested positive for\nmarijuana during a routine drug test as an employee of the Defense Department. As a\nresult, he resigned in lieu of termination. Since then, he obtained treatment and has not\nused marijuana since April 2006. He has not used alcohol, which he also abused, since\nAugust 2007, except for a one-time slip in 2010. He regularly attends group meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA), volunteers in his community, and has a good employment\nrecord. Even though he presented substantial evidence of reform and rehabilitation, it is\noutweighed by his long-term history of drug abuse and making false statements during\nthe security-clearance process. Taken together, these matters continue to undermine\nJanuary 19, 2011\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.17; Tr. 10\u201314. \n2\n2\nhis trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. Accordingly, as explained below, this\ncase is decided against Applicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on March 26,\n1\n2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it sets forth the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline E for personal conduct. The SOR also recommended that the case\nbe submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. In his Answer, Applicant\nadmitted all allegations and provided a brief explanation in mitigation. His admissions\nare incorporated into the findings of fact below. The case was assigned to a judge July\n2, 2010. The case was reassigned to me September 7, 2010. The hearing took place\nSeptember 16, 2010. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received September 27, 2010.\nProcedural Matters \nAt the hearing, the SOR was amended on my own motion to add a second\nparagraph citing Guideline H for drug involvement and subparagraph 2.a as follows:\nThose matters as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h.  I took this\n2\naction because those matters are explicitly covered under the drug involvement\nguideline. There were no objections or requests for additional time by the parties. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old former federal employee who is seeking a security\nclearance for a consulting job with a federal contractor. His educational background\nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. He was married for more than\n20 years until a recent divorce. He has two adult children, a son and a daughter, from\nthe marriage. \n \n\n Exhibits B\u2013K; Tr. 90\u2013102 (witness testimony). \n3\n Tr. 80\u201389 (testimony of minister). \n4\n Tr. 68\u201380. \n5\n Exhibit 2. \n6\n Exhibit 6 at 3. \n7\n Tr. 66\u201367. \n8\n3\nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes a 25-year period working for the federal\ngovernment that ended in 2006, when he resigned in lieu of termination. He worked\nprimarily in the field of accounting, rising over the years from his initial position as a\nclerk typist (pay grade GS-3) to senior-level accountant position for the Defense\nDepartment (pay grade GS-15). He was a stellar employee with a record of outstanding\nduty performance.  Since resigning in 2006, his employment history includes a brief\n3\nperiod of unemployment, a job as an administrative assistant at a church,  and working\n4\nas a laborer for two different firms. He is currently employed as a customer-service\nassociate for a large grocery store. His duties grant him access to large amounts of\ncash and other financial matters. He has a good employment record at the store as\nverified by the store manager.  Applicant has had no absenteeism or indications of\n5\nsubstance abuse while employed there, and the store manager considers him a\ntrustworthy employee.   \nApplicant has a 30-year history of drug abuse (marijuana), much of it taking place\nwhile he held a security clearance as a federal employee. He used marijuana in social\nsituations, with coworkers after work hours, and with his wife who was a regular user of\nmarijuana. As such, he made deliberately false statements in 2004, when he denied\nusing illegal drugs in response to questions on a  security clearance application.  His\n6\ndrug abuse came to light in April 2006, when he tested positive for marijuana during a\nroutine drug test as an employee of the Defense Department. As a result, he resigned in\nlieu of termination. \nApplicant then obtained treatment and he received a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence and marijuana dependence in early remission.  He has not used marijuana\n7\nsince April 2006. He has not used alcohol, which he also abused, since August 2007,\nexcept for a one-time slip in 2010.  He regularly attends group meetings of Alcoholics\n8\nAnonymous (AA) and  volunteers in his community. He also has the support of family\nmembers who live in the local community. He has periodic contact and communications\nwith his ex-wife, but he does not know if she continues to use marijuana. He no longer\nassociates with anyone who uses marijuana.     \n\n Exhibit 1. \n9\n Exhibit 1 at 47 of 52. \n10\n Exhibit 3.\n11\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n12\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n4\nApplicant truthfully disclosed his marijuana use in March 2008, when completing\na security clearance application for the consulting job.  He made the following\n9\ncomments to explain his marijuana use:\nI have experienced a long term addiction to alcohol and marijuana which\nresulted in several negative consequences including: loss of security\nclearance in April 2006; filing of bankruptcy in July 2006; contributed to the\nlegal separation [now divorce] of myself and my wife in July 2006 and\nnegative health issues. I also have experienced depression/anxiety and\nhave seen a psychiatrist and counselors to treat these illnesses. I have\ntaken SSRI\u2019s (antidepressants) to treat these illnesses. I currently have a\nstrong 12 step program in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA); see my\npsychiatrist and counselor regularly and all my illnesses are currently in\nremission. I have sustained my recovery and understand that I will\ncontinue in AA on a weekly basis to prevent relapse. I am stable and\npresent no security risk.    \n10\nApplicant also provided extensive and detailed information about his marijuana\nuse, the circumstances surrounding his resignation from federal employment, and other\nmatters in September 2008, when he was interviewed during the background\ninvestigation.  At the hearing, Applicant continued to acknowledge and admit his long-\n11\nterm history of marijuana use and he did not attempt to minimize it. I found his testimony\nto be credible and worthy of belief. \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n12\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\n\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n13\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n14\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n15\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n16\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n20\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n21\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n22\n5\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n13\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n14\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n15\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n16\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n17\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n18\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n19\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.20\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n22\n\n AG \u00b6 15. \n23\n AG \u00b6 24. \n24\n6\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nThe personal conduct and drug involvement matters are discussed together\nbecause the SOR allegations are factually interrelated or connected. Under Guideline E\nfor personal conduct, the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into doubt\ndue to false statements and credible adverse information that may not be enough to\nsupport action under any other guideline. The overall concern under Guideline E is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n23\nAnd under Guideline H for drug involvement, the overall concern is: \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises concerns about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.24\nUnder both guidelines, I have considered the following disqualifying conditions:\n\u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n\u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's\nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the\nperson's personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in\nanother country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or\nthat is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve\nas a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or\nintelligence service or other group;\n\n7\n\u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse;\n\u00b6 25(b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\n\u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, . . . ; \n\u00b6 25(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; or\n\u00b6 25(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who is a staff member or a recognized drug treatment\nprogram; and \n\u00b6 25(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \nLikewise, under both guidelines, I have considered the following mitigating\nconditions:\n\u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur;\n\u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n\u00b6 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such\nas: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation; and \n\u00b6 26(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\n \nApplicant has a 30-year history of drug abuse, much of it taking place while he\nheld a security clearance as a federal employee. He made deliberately false statements\nin 2004, when he denied using illegal drugs in response to questions on a security\n\n Exhibit 2. \n25\n In 1986, President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12564, which established a drug-free workplace\n26\nfor the federal government. It provided, among other things, that (1) federal employees are required to refrain\nfrom the use of illegal drugs; (2) the use of illegal drugs by federal employees, whether on or off duty, is\ncontrary to the efficiency of the service, and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for federal\nemployment.\n AG \u00b6 2(e)(1). \n27\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\u2013(9).\n28\n8\nclearance application.  He has had negative consequences due to his drug abuse\n25\n(marital problems, financial problems, and job loss). Since resigning from federal\nemployment in 2006, he has done a remarkably good job at addressing his substance\nabuse and otherwise stabilizing his life, to include active participation in AA and steady\nemployment in which he excels and enjoys. He appears to be well on his way to a life of\nabstinence from both marijuana and alcohol. For those efforts, he deserves substantial\ncredit in mitigation.   \nNevertheless, Applicant brought these problems on himself by engaging in illegal\nbehavior (possession and use of marijuana) he knew or should have known was\nprohibited and at odds with federal employment and holding a security clearance.  His\n26\ndrug abuse was reckless and a major breach of trust. He also engaged in deceit by\nmaking false statements on his 2004 security clearance application. And he did not\nvoluntarily report his drug abuse before his 2006 positive drug test.   \n27\nMisconduct has consequences, and sometimes those consequences last a long\ntime. That is the situation here. Even though Applicant presented substantial evidence\nof reform and rehabilitation, it is outweighed by his long-term history of drug abuse and\nmaking false statements during the security-clearance process. Taken together, these\nmatters continue to undermine his trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in a\nsecurity-clearance context.      \nTo conclude, the evidence as a whole justifies current doubts about his\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent\nstandard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this\nconclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s\n28\nfavorable evidence. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 24,\n2008. On November 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nH and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, answered the allegations, and\nrequested a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe Government\u2019s written case on November 23, 2009.  Applicant received a complete\n1\nfile of relevant material (FORM) on November 30, 2009, and was provided the\nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n2\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s case. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM in a timely manner.\nBased upon a review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in the\nSOR. He also admitted the allegations in \u00b6 2.a. Applicant included a statement of intent\nwith his Answer. In that statement, he promised not to \u201cabuse any drugs in the future\u201d\nand understood that a violation would result in the revocation of his security clearance\n(Item 3).\nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school and attended a technical college for two years. He obtained a degree in\nelectrical technology in 1987 (Item 1). He is married with one child. He has worked in a\nprofessional capacity in the electrical engineering field for his entire career. He has\nbeen with his current employer since 1998.\nApplicant first used marijuana while attending high school in 1981. Applicant\nclaims he stopped using marijuana after graduating from high school \u201cfor a long period\nof time.\u201d He admitted that he last used marijuana in December 2008 on his security\nclearance application. \nIn November 2001, Applicant was drinking at home. He proceeded to drive to a\nstore to get something to eat. The police stopped Applicant for driving on the wrong side\nof the road. Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). While he was\nwaiting for his court date on his DWI, Applicant was stopped for another incident (Item\n5). \nIn December 2001, Applicant took a demerol tablet to get \u201chigh\u201d at home. He\nthen drove to get something to eat. Applicant drove into a tree and left the scene. After\ndriving erratically, Applicant was stopped by the police. He failed a field sobriety test but\npassed the breathalyzer test. Applicant was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle\nunder the influence of demerol. He served 20 days home confinement, completed\ncommunity service, and was fined approximately $1,000. The court ordered Applicant to\nsubmit to substance abuse screening for one year (Item 5).\nApplicant completed his security clearance application in October 2008. He\nreported using marijuana illegally from April 2008 until he signed his security clearance\napplication. He estimated his use was 25-30 times. He described his use as twice a\nweek at home when he was alone. Applicant was employed with a defense contractor at\nthe time (Item 4).\n\n3\nApplicant summarized in his answer to the FORM that he was not addicted to\nmarijuana and therefore, he did not seek therapy. He stated that he had no difficulty\nstopping his marijuana use. He was not a frequent user of marijuana and that he intend\nnot to use it again. He referred to his expertise in the workplace. He also stated that he\ndoes not want to put his family in danger by making foolish mistakes. Applicant\nacknowledged that his marijuana use has been \u201cnothing but trouble.\u201d\nIn December 2008, Applicant was interviewed by the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator (Item 5). He admitted a history of marijuana use during\nhis employment for a defense contractor. He told the investigator that he used\nmarijuana after completing his October 2008 security clearance application and three\ndays before his interview with the investigator. He claimed that the illegal use of\nmarijuana did not affect his job, but if it would affect his employment status, he would\nstop and seek drug counseling (Item 5).\nIn May 2009, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories. He stated that he\nintended to stop using marijuana. He explained that after his December 2008 interview,\nhe had been young and foolish and acted in a reckless manner but is now a responsible\nperson (Item 5).\nApplicant is described as an excellent coworker and a mentor in the company.\nHe has the knowledge and experience of a veteran of the trade. He is a dedicated\nemployee and family man. He is dependable and responsible.\nApplicant\u2019s brother described him as an honest and hard-working individual who\nhas made sacrifices for others throughout his life. He praised Applicant for his honesty\nin reporting the illegal use of marijuana on his security clearance application. He\nbelieves Applicant realizes his mistakes and has moved forward with his life and left his\nmarijuana use behind. \nApplicant\u2019s employee performance reviews for the past ten years consistently\nrate him as fully satisfactory. He is an asset to the company, and plays a vital role in the\nperformance of the company mission. His supervisor describes him as a safe and\nexperienced worker. His productivity, knowledge, and cooperation are excellent.\n.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted his ilegal use of marijuana, in varying amounts and frequency,\nspanning a period from about 1981 until December 2008. He possessed marijuana\nbefore he used it. He claimed that he stopped using marijuana for a long period after\nhigh school. Under AG \u00b6 25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance\u201d is a disqualifying condition. Applicant illegally used marijuana after\ncompleting his October 2008 security clearance application. He used marijuana during\nthe time that he was employed by a federal contractor. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply;\nhowever, 25(g) does not apply because his security clearance was not approved at the\ntime he used marijuana. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\npattern of illegal drug use (marijuana) continued from a young age to adult maturity. He\nwas a mature adult working for a defense contractor and violating the drug policy when\nhe continued to use illegal drugs. He used marijuana after completing his 2008 security\nclearance application. This shows poor judgment and lack of trustworthiness. I do not\nfind that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where there is Aa demonstrated intent not\nto abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d \nApplicant signed a statement of intent in November 2009. He reiterated his\npromise not to use marijuana in the future. He claimed that his last use was just before\nhis OPM interview in December 2008. Applicant\u2019s most recent use of marijuana\nincluded frequencies he described as twice a week. Moreover, he used it during his long\nemployment with a defense contractor and after his arrests which included a year of\ncourt-ordered substance abuse screening. I do not find his statement of intent or period\nof abstinence to be sufficient for mitigation under this condition. None of the other\nmitigating conditions fully apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\n\n6\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWith respect to the personal conduct concerns involving Applicant\u2019s illegal use of\nmarijuana from 1981 until December 2008, while holding a position with a defense\ncontractor and after completing his 2008 security clearance application, the pertinent\ndisqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of rule violations,\u201d and AG\n16(e)(1), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about ones\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect their personal, profession, or community standing.\u201d\nCertainly, Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana during his employment violates rules and\nregulations, and a lengthy history of such problems is conduct a person might want to\nconceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing.\nThe mitigating condition outlined in AG 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d\napplies to Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana. The government, Applicant\u2019s security officials\nand supervisor are aware of these problems. He disclosed the information on his\nsecurity clearance application. He has taken positive steps of disclosure, eliminating any\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. I do not believe Applicant would\ncompromise national security to avoid public disclosure of these problems. Any\npersonal conduct security concerns, pertaining to illegal drug use, are dealt with more\nthroughly under Guideline H in this decision. Applicant deserves credit in the whole\nperson analysis for candidly admitting his recent illegal use of marijuana in his security\nclearance application. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that they are not\nsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature, educated\nprofessional. He has a wife and a son to support. He served in a professional capacity\nfor his entire career. He used marijuana during his time with his current employer. He\nnever felt there was a problem. He continued to use marijuana after his court-ordered\nsubstance abuse screening for one year in 2001. His last use marijuanana was in\nDecember 2008. \nApplicant completed his 2008 security clearance application and disclosed his\nuse of marijuana and his arrests. He told the interviewer in 2008 that he used marijuana\nthree days prior to the interview. He was candid during the security clearance process\nand acknowledged his mistakes. He has not obtained any drug counseling and did not\nbelieve that the use of marijuana affected his job performance. Indeed, he has a very\ngood record of employment. He has character references who recommend him. He\nintends to stop using any illegal drug in the future. His most recent marijuana, use given\nthe history of illegal use, despite his statement of intent, does not provide sufficient\nmitigation to carry his burden of proof under Guideline H or the whole person concept.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement. He has mitigated the security concerns under\npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A.

On September 30, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 16, 2009.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing that same day, and subsequently requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on November 24, 2009,\nand I received the case assignment the same day.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nDecember 7, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 26, 2010.\n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were received without\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A\nthrough H, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on\nFebruary 2, 2010.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nFebruary 26, 2010, to submit additional matters.  He submitted nothing.  The record\nclosed on February 26, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admits the factual allegations in all three\nParagraphs of the SOR, with explanations. \nFinancial Considerations\nThe Applicant worked for a company that provided security systems for \u201cboth\ncommercial, [and] residential security applications.\u201d  (TR at page 25 lines 11~23.)  50\npercent of his income was \u201cguaranteed in salary and 50 percent\u201d was based on sales.\n(TR at page 10~16.)  As a result, the collapse of the real estate market caused the\nApplicant\u2019s current financial difficulties.\n1.a.  The Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in\nSeptember of 1999.  (GX 4 at page 5.)  As a result of this filing, the Applicant\u2019s debts\nwere discharged in December of 1999.  (Id.)  This bankruptcy was caused by the\nApplicant acquiring joint liabilities with his ex-girl friend; who ran up their debts, and left\nthe Applicant with their excessive, joint indebtedness.  (TR at page 61 line 2 to page 63\nline 18).\n1.b. and 1.c.  As a result of the recent collapse of the real estate market, the\nApplicant primary residence was foreclosed by Creditor #1, to which the Applicant owes\nabout $759,833 on his first mortgage.  (TR at page 48 line 17 to page 50 line 10.)  The\nApplicant also owes about $46,557 to Creditor #2 as the result of a second mortgage.\n(TR at page 52 lines 5~17.)  Despite the Applicant\u2019s best efforts, he could not keep up\nwith his house payments.  (TR at page 48 line 17 to page 50 line 10.)  However, the\nApplicant has offered nothing to show that his primary mortgage is covered by\nCalifornia\u2019s Anti-Deficiency Act.  (See California Code of Civil Procedure, Sections\n580a.~580d.)  Furthermore, he has offered nothing to show that he has addressed his\nsecond mortgage.  I find that both debts are still outstanding.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\n\n4\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  In 1999, the Appellant went bankrupt\npursuant to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  More recently, the Applicant has\ndefaulted on his primary and secondary mortgage loans; and as a result, has in excess\nof $800,000 in past due indebtedness.\nThe Mitigating Condition found in Subparagraph 20(b) is applicable where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn . . .), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.@  With the collapse of the real estate market, the\nApplicant\u2019s income was drastically reduced; and as such, he could not keep on his\nhouse payments.  However, Subparagraph 20(d) under the Mitigating Conditions is not\napplicable, as there is no evidence to show \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@  Here, the Applicant has offered\nnothing to show that he has addressed, or is excused from, his admitted past due debts.\nThey are still outstanding.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n5\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Here, he has the unqualified support of\nthose with whom he works.  (AppXs E~H.)  However, the record evidence leaves me\nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his financial considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b. & 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted that he previously owed all of the SOR debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.e ($33) (Item 4). He also provided an explanation for his financial problems, and explained that he paid the seven debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($893), 1.b ($931), 1.c ($113), 1.d ($246), 1.f ($86), 1.g ($678), and 1.o ($1,586) (Item 4). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 He worked for a defense contractor from December 2001 to 2008, and he has been a contract employee for over one year working at a military installation (Item 6 at 14; FORM response).

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 15 delinquent debts totaling \n$40,318. In July and August 2009, Applicant paid seven debts totaling $4,533. He \ndisputed one debt for $33. His remaining SOR debts totaled $35,752, and all related to \neducation loans. He indicated he could have begun a payment plan on his remaining \nSOR debts; however, he chose not to do so. He failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 5). \nOn July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR \nto Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \nDecember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 28, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated September 29, 2009, was provided \nto him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 On November 30, 2009, Applicant provided a \nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted that he previously owed all of \nthe SOR debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.e ($33) (Item 4). He also provided an explanation for \nhis financial problems, and explained that he paid the seven debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($893), 1.b ($931), 1.c ($113), 1.d ($246), 1.f ($86), 1.g ($678), and 1.o ($1,586) (Item \n4). After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 He worked for a \ndefense contractor from December 2001 to 2008, and he has been a contract employee \nfor over one year working at a military installation (Item 6 at 14; FORM response). He \nhas not had access to classified information for the last year; however, he would need \naccess to classified information in the event of exceptional circumstances (Item 6 at 14; \nFORM response).  \n \nApplicant received a bachelor of science degree in June 2005. He married in \n1996 and divorced in 2005. He remarried in late 2008 (Item 6 at 13-14). His children \nwere born in 1997, 1999, and 2001. He has never served in the U.S. military. He has \nnever been fired from a job or left employment under adverse circumstances. His file \ndoes not contain any adverse information relating to police involvement. For example, \nhe has never been charged with a felony, any firearms or explosives offense(s), and \ndoes not have any currently pending charges. He has never been charged with any \noffense related to alcohol or drugs. He has not been arrested for or charged with any \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated October 19, \n2009; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated October 27, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant \nthat he had 30 days after his receipt to submit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 21, 2008, security clearance application (Item 5). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nother misdemeanor-level offenses. There is no evidence that he has abused alcohol or \ndrugs. In the financial information section of his 2008 security clearance application, he \nlisted an April 2008 state tax lien related to delinquent state income taxes, and \napproximately $27,000 in delinquent student loans. Applicant did not list any periods of \nunemployment in the last seven years.     \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) listed 15 delinquent debts totaling \n$40,318 as follows: \u00b6 1.a (state tax\u2014$893); \u00b6 1.b (state tax\u2014$931); \u00b6 1.c (collection \naccount\u2014$113); \u00b6 1.d (collection account\u2014$246); \u00b6 1.e (collection account\u2014$33); \u00b6 1.f \n(collection account\u2014$86); \u00b6 1.g (collection account\u2014$678); \u00b6\u00b6 1.h to 1.n (education \ndebts\u2014$3,492; $6,248; $3,621; $4,635; $7,317; $7,342; $3,079 ); and \u00b6 1.o (collection \naccount\u2014$1,586) (Item 1).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted responsibility for all debts except the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($33) (Item 4 at 2). He checked his credit report, and this debt did not appear \non it (Item 4 at 2).  \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. In approximately 2006, the federal \ngovernment garnished Applicant\u2019s pay for income taxes owed for the 2004 and 2005 tax \nyears (Item 6 at 11, 12). He completed repayment of his delinquent federal income \ntaxes in October 2006 (Item 6 at 12). \n \nOn December 23, 2008, Applicant explained to an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator that his separation in 2003 from his wife and children \nand divorce in 2005 caused financial problems for him (Item 6 at 11-14). His spouse \nwas unemployed and the family debts became his sole responsibility (Item 6 at 11). \nInitially, he had to pay monthly child support of $800 (Item 6 at 11). He also had to pay \n$2,700 for their children\u2019s medical care (Item 6 at 11). His former spouse moved to a \ndifferent state and it was expensive for Applicant to travel to visit his children (Item 6 at \n11). Applicant told the OPM investigator that he did not receive financial counseling.  \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant received notice of the SOR debts through DOHA \ninterrogatories (Item 6). He noted that his wife unexpectedly needed a tonsillectomy in \nthe Spring of 2009, and he was unable to immediately address his delinquent debts \n(Item 6 at 4). Medical costs for the tonsillectomy exceeded his insurance by about \n$3,000 (Item 6 at 14). He indicated he planned to pay a medical debt for $109, and the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($86) in May 2009 (Item 6 at 4). \n   \nOn July 6, 2009, and August 4, 2009, Applicant paid seven SOR debts totaling \n$4,533. On July 6, 2009, he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($113), 1.d ($246), and 1.f \n($86) (Item 4 at 1, 6, 7, 8). \n \nOn August 4, 2009, Applicant paid four state tax liens, including the two tax debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($893) and 1.b ($931) (Item 4 at 1, 4, 5) and two additional non-SOR tax \nliens. His state tax payments totaled $3,203 (Item 4 at 1; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). The \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nstate required that he pay all debts with a lump sum (Item 4 at 1). It took him some time \nto save sufficient funds to pay his state tax debts (Item 4 at 1). On August 4, 2009, he \nalso paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($678) and 1.o ($1,586) (Item 4 at 2, 9, 10). The \n$1,586 debt resulted from a contract to a dating service (Item 6 at 13).  \n \nApplicant made a $1,870 payment towards his delinquent student loans when the \nfederal government involuntarily garnished his federal tax refund in 2006 or 2007 (Item \n6 at 5). He said he planned to start paying his student loans through a payroll deduction \nof 15% of his after-tax income regardless of whether his clearance was granted or not \n(Item 4 at 2).4 However, he wanted to wait for the decision on his clearance to start this \nallotment because it would be \u201csilly to have a payment or [two]\u201d deducted from his \npaycheck and then he would become unemployed (Item 4 at 2). If he became \nunemployed, he would be unable to make payments to address his delinquent student \nloans (Item 4 at 2). When he responded to the FORM, he again emphasized that \u201cit \nwould be rather silly to\u201d set up an allotment to pay his student loans before he learned \nwhether his security clearance would be granted.   \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s net monthly pay is about $4,700 (Item 6 at 9). His \nmonthly expenses are about $3,500, leaving about $1,200 a month to address his \nstudent loans (Item 6 at 9, 14). Applicant did not provide any documents showing his \ncommunications with his student loan creditors concerning his efforts to pay, establish \npayment plans, or otherwise resolve his delinquent student loans.5    \n \nAn information technology specialist, who works with Applicant, described his \ncareful compliance with agency regulations and policies (FORM response). She lauded \nhis work ethic and recommended that he receive a security clearance (FORM \nresponse). \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n4On May 12, 2009, Applicant said as soon as his smaller debts were paid, he would contact the \nholder of his student loans, and authorize a direct payment from his salary of about 15% to address this \ndebt (Item 6 at 5).  \n \n5The FORM at pages 5-6 notes the lack of documentation showing Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve \nhis delinquent student loans.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his OPM \ninterview, in his response to DOHA interrogatories, and in his SOR response. In 2006, \nthe federal government garnished his pay because he did not pay sufficient federal \nincome taxes in 2004 and 2005. His student loans have been delinquent for several \nyears. His SOR listed 15 delinquent debts totaling $40,318. Although he paid seven \nSOR debts as well as his delinquent federal income taxes, his financial difficulties \nextended over several years and continue today. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether he is fully committed to resolving his delinquent SOR \ndebts and is making adequate steps to do so.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by \nseparation, divorce, and medical problems that were not fully covered by insurance. \nHowever, he has not provided sufficient evidence to establish that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances with respect to his unresolved SOR debts. He had sufficient \nfinancial resources to begin a payment plan to address his student loans, and chose not \nto do so.6  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling; \nhowever, he probably has otherwise learned about financial issues. Applicant cannot \nreceive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he has not paid, started payment plans, \ndisputed, or otherwise resolved his delinquent student loans. There are some initial, \npositive \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has \nadmitted his responsibility for the SOR debts. He paid seven SOR debts. He promised \nto eventually resolve his student loans. He also established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) because he showed some good faith7 in the resolution of his SOR debts by \nadmitting responsibility for all of his SOR debts except for one small debt, paying seven \n \n6\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd.

He \nchecked his credit report, and this debt did not appear on it. I conclude this debt is not \nestablished as his responsibility, and find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the Formal Findings on \npage 9, infra.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent student loans. He resolved seven of his smaller \ndelinquent SOR debts and paid his delinquent federal income taxes; however, he did \nnot start a payment plan to address his delinquent student loans even though he had \nsufficient financial resources to establish a payment plan. His steps are simply \ninadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for volunteering to \nsupport the Department of Defense as an employee of a defense contractor. There is \nno evidence that he has a criminal record or has ever violated security rules. There is \nevery indication that he is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, his \nemployer, and that he is an honorable person. He does not abuse alcohol or illegal \ndrugs. He has never been fired from a job or left employment under adverse \ncircumstances. His file does not contain any adverse information relating to police \ninvolvement. His separation, divorce, and medical problems contributed to his financial \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwoes. He paid his delinquent federal taxes, seven SOR debts, and other non-SOR \ndebts. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. He began to have \nfinancial difficulties several years ago, when multiple debts became delinquent. It was \nnecessary for the federal government to garnish his pay to ensure his federal income \ntaxes were paid, In May 2009, he responded to DOHA interrogatories, and in August \n2009, he responded to the SOR. He had ample opportunity to contact his student loan \ncreditors and to make greater progress in the resolution of his student loan debts. He \ndid not pay, start payments, dispute, or otherwise resolve his student loans, which total \n$35,752. He had about $1,200 a month after expenses to address his delinquent \nstudent loans. He said he could have begun a payment plan to address his delinquent \nstudent loans several months ago; however, he chose not to do so. He emphasized that \nit would be \u201csilly\u201d for him to begin payments, even though he had the resources to make \npayments, before he learned whether his security clearance would be granted.  \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant made insufficient progress to resolve his delinquent \nstudent loans, even though he had steady employment and ample opportunity to \ncontact his student loan creditors and provide documentation. He was on clear notice \nfrom his receipt of DOHA interrogatories and even more so after he received the SOR \nthat he needed to show substantial progress in the resolution of his delinquent student \nloans; however, he did not provide documentation showing his efforts to accomplish this \nsecurity responsibility.    \n   \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful \nconsideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the \ngovernment\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h to 1.n: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

The evidence shows she has a well-\ndocumented and lengthy history of drug abuse and related criminal conduct, which\nceased in 2000. She presented sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation to\nmitigate the drug involvement and criminal conduct security concerns. She did not give\ndeliberately false answers to three questions about her police record when completing a\nsecurity clearance application in 2008. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is\ndecided for Applicant.\nMay 26, 2011\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Tr. 115\u2013116. \n2\n Tr. 18\u201319. \n3\n Tr. 105\u2013109.\n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on August 3,\n1\n2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and\nit endeavored to set forth Applicant\u2019s history of drug abuse under Guideline H; her\nrelated criminal conduct under Guideline J; and three allegations that she gave false\nanswers in response to questions on a August 2008 security clearance application\nunder Guideline E.    \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me January 26, 2011. The hearing took place February 24, 2011. The\nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received March 3, 2011. \nAt the close of evidence, I kept the record open until March 16, 2011, to allow\nApplicant to present documentary evidence in addition to Exhibits A\u2013E. Her timely post-\nhearing document, a letter from the drug treatment program, is marked and admitted as\nExhibit F without objections.      \nProcedural and Evidentiary Matters \nAt hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.c to\ncorrect a drafting error as follows: the phrase \u201cas set forth in 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, above\u201d was\namended to \u201cas set forth in 2.h, 2.i, and 2.j, above.\u201d  The motion was granted without\n2\nobjections. \n \nAlso at hearing, Department Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 2.e, an allegation of motor\nvehicle theft in 1988, because Applicant was the victim not the perpetrator in that case.3\nIn addition, Department Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i and 2.j, allegations of transporting\nillegal aliens and making a fictitious or fraudulent statement in 2004, because those\ncharges involved another individual with a similar name.  Accordingly, those matters are\n4\nnot addressed further.   \n\n Exhibit E. \n5\n Exhibit A. \n6\n Exhibit B. \n7\n Exhibit C. \n8\n Exhibit D. \n9\n See Exhibits 1\u20139, 11, 13, 17, 18, and F. \n10\n3\nConcerning documentary exhibits, the following Government Exhibits were not\nadmitted for the reasons stated during the hearing: Exhibit 10, Exhibit 12, Exhibit 14,\nExhibit 15, and Exhibit 16. In addition, Exhibit 18 was admitted for a limited purpose as\nstated during the hearing. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s answers to the SOR allegations were mixed with admissions and\ndenials as well as explanations. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. In\naddition, the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.  \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor.

Although chemically unlike morphine or heroin, methadone acts on the\nsame opioid receptors as these drugs, and thus has many of the same effects. \n Tr. 78. \n15\n Exhibit 3 at 7. \n16\n4\nchildren during the marriage, which ended by divorce in 1993. Other than a little periodic\nmarijuana use, she used no other illegal drugs until about 1986 or 1987, when she and\nher husband separated some years before the final divorce. One of the people with\nwhom she used drugs with, and engaged in related criminal activity with, is the father of\nher youngest child. In about 1988, that person was prosecuted, convicted, and\nincarcerated. Applicant was drug-free during the five years of his imprisonment. She\nattended drug treatment during this time. She reconnected with this person at some\npoint after his release from prison. That led to further drug abuse, which continued until\n2000, although she had some periods during 1993\u20132000 when she did not use. \nThe seminal event that led Applicant to her ongoing recovery occurred in\nFebruary 2000, when she was in a house raided by a police SWAT unit as a probable\nlocation of heroin dealing and use.  She was detained and questioned by the police,\n11\nbut not arrested or prosecuted. The event was a wake-up call for Applicant, as she\ndecided that she was \u201csick and tired of being out on the street, using and abusing and\npeople abusing [her] and not knowing where [she] was going to wake up the next day\nand, you know, going to jail.\u201d  At about this time, she met a drug-free gentleman and\n12\nbegan a romantic relationship with him that lasted until about 2007. This gentleman\nwas, apparently, a key factor in Applicant\u2019s recovery. Initially, he paid for her to\nparticipate in a private program before she was accepted into the current program. \nFrom about July 2000 to the present, Applicant has participated in a nonprofit\nsubstance abuse program. The extensive medical records, provided by Applicant in\nresponse to interrogatories, show that she has been assessed or diagnosed with opioid\ndependence.  She now participates in a prescribed methadone  treatment program.\n13\n14\nShe is engaged in a self-paced process of gradually decreasing the dosage, with the\ngoal of eliminating methadone use. She reported that her daily dosage has decreased\nfrom about 75 mg to 16 mg.  She reported that has earned the privilege of taking home\n15\na 13-day dosage, as opposed to reporting daily for medication. Her testimony was\nconsistent with the medical records, which reflect, as of January 2010, she was stable\nwith a methadone dose of 22 mg and 13-day take-home privileges.  Her current status\n16\nis summarized in a March 2011 letter from the treatment program as follows:\n\n Exhibit F. \n17\n Tr. 89\u201390. \n18\n Exhibit 6 at 3\u20134. \n19\n Tr. 127. \n20\n Exhibit 1. \n21\n5\n[Applicant] is currently participating in the methadone maintenance\ntreatment program since June 2003, and has demonstrated continued\nprogress towards her recovery by maintaining counselor-client contact,\nabiding by all federal and clinic rules, providing negative toxicology\nreports, and following her treatment plan. Her prognosis for continued\nstability, and maintenance of a drug free lifestyle is rated as favorable, and\nis assessed at being in the maintenance stage of change with a healthy\nhistory of long term commitment to recovery.    \n17\nApplicant no longer associates with anyone involved in illegal drugs, and has not\ndone so in years. After her relationship with the gentleman ended in about 2007, she\nlived with her adult children on a temporary basis. She has lived alone, albeit in her\nson\u2019s house, since late 2009. She rents the house from her son, who is away serving in\nthe U.S. armed forces.  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is related to drug abuse. Unable to hold a steady\njob, she committed crimes to support her habit.  She stole things she could sell and\n18\nused the money to buy drugs. During 1987\u20131999, she had arrests, charges, or\nconvictions for offenses such as possession of drug paraphernalia, shoplifting, theft,\nburglary, probation violation, etc. The most serious appears to be an arrest in 1988 for\nmultiple felony theft and burglary offenses. She pleaded guilty to three counts of\nburglary and was sentenced to, among other things, five years of probation. Since the\nraid by the SWAT unit in 2000, she was involved in a single incident of criminal conduct,\nbut it was not related to her past drug abuse. In 2002, Applicant pushed the former\ngirlfriend of the gentleman with whom she was then involved. She acknowledged at\nhearing she did so out of jealously. She was charged with the offense of assault-\nrecklessly cause injury, but it was dismissed without prejudice in February 2003.  In\n19\ntotal, she estimates serving about eight to nine months in jail for her various crimes.   \n20\nApplicant began her current employment in May 2008, after going through the\ncompany\u2019s hiring process, which included passing a drug test (she disclosed her\nmethadone use). Thereafter, in August 2008, she completed a security clearance\napplication in which she answered various questions about her background.  She fully\n21\ndisclosed her methadone use on a prescription basis in response to the relevant\nquestion. \n\n Exhibit 8. \n22\n Tr. 111\u2013112. \n23\n Tr. 112\u2013114. \n24\n Tr. 114\u2013118. \n25\n Tr. 49\u201367. \n26\n Tr. 60. \n27\n6\nConcerning her police record, in response to Question 23a, which asked about\never having been charged with or convicted of a felony offense, she answered \u201cYes\u201d\nand disclosed the felony-level burglary offenses that ended in five years of probation\nand drug treatment. She did not report the 1995 arrest and charge for third-degree\nburglary, which was dismissed.  She did not report the more recent burglary (SOR \u00b6\n22\n2.g) because she did not remember it, in part, because it was dismissed.  In response\n23\nto Question 23d, which asked about ever having been charged with or convicted or any\nalcohol- or drug-related offenses, she answered in the negative. She did not report\ncharges of possession of drug paraphernalia (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h) because she\ndid not understand the scope of the question went beyond the actual drugs to include\ndrug paraphernalia.  She understood the question included things such as possession\n24\nof cocaine, but did not include drug paraphernalia. And in response to Question 23f,\nwhich asked about  arrests, charges, or convictions within the last seven years not\notherwise reported, she answered in the negative. She did not report the 2002 assault\noffense (SOR \u00b6 2.h) because she did not remember it, in part, because it was\ndismissed.  \n25\nAt hearing, Applicant\u2019s sister testified about her involvement with Applicant.  The\n26\nsister is a recently retired employee of the same company that employs Applicant. The\nsister has been involved with Applicant over the years and has participated in her\ntreatment. The sister has seen \u201ctremendous change\u201d  in Applicant since 2000 to\n27\ninclude the following: (1) a vastly improved physical appearance; (2) improved health;\n(3) full-time employment for many years; (4) financial stability, to include buying two\nvehicles, the most recent of which was a new vehicle; (5) reestablishing  relationships\nwith her children; (6) responsible behavior on a day-to-day basis; (7) active participation\nand involvement in a church; (8) immaculate housekeeping; and (9) improved self-\nesteem. At one point, Applicant lived with and cared for her sister while her sister\nrecovered from the effects of a stroke. As a former employee who held a security\nclearance, the sister candidly acknowledged that she would not have trusted Applicant\nin the past, but she is now of the opinion that Applicant can be trusted.   \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n28\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n29\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n30\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n31\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n32\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n33\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n34\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n35\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n36\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n37\n7\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n28\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n29\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n30\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n31\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n32\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n33\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n34\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n35\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.36\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.37\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n38\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 24\u201326 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n39\n AG \u00b6 24(b). \n40\n AG 30\u201332 \u00b6\u00b6 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n41\n8\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n38\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\n1.\nDrug Involvement and Criminal Conduct\nThese matters are discussed together because the evidence shows they are\nfactually interrelated. Under Guideline H,  the concern is the use of an illegal drug, or\n39\nmisuse of a prescription drug, raises questions about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. In this context, the term drug abuse means \u201cthe illegal use of a\ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from the approved medical\ndirection.\u201d  Under Guideline J,  the concern is that criminal activity can raise questions\n40\n41\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Both guidelines share a\nconcern about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to follow laws, rules, and regulations.\nHere, the evidence is more than sufficient to establish concerns based on\nApplicant\u2019s well-documented and lengthy history of drug abuse and related criminal\nconduct. The evidence shows Applicant was a drug abuser whose drug of choice was\nheroin, which she sometimes mixed with cocaine. Introduced to drug abuse at an early\nage, she engaged in it until 2000. She also engaged in criminal conduct to pay for her\ndrugs, and she has several arrests, charges, and convictions to show for it. The last\ndrug-related arrest took place in 1995, although she was questioned as a suspect\nduring the SWAT raid in 2000. She had a relatively minor incident of criminal conduct\n(the assault charge) in 2002, but it ended in dismissal not a conviction. This incident\nappears to be aberrational conduct by Applicant, and it no longer raises a concern. \nBased on the evidence as a whole, the following disqualifying conditions under\nGuideline H are raised:\n\n9\nAG \u00b6 25(a) any drug abuse;\nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia;\nAG \u00b6 25(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug\ndependence; and \nAG \u00b6 25(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed\nclincal social worker who is a staff member of a recognized treatment\nprogram.\nAnd under Guideline J, the following disqualifying conditions are raised:  \nAG \u00b6 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\nAG \u00b6 31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-\nmandated program. \nThere are several mitigating conditions to consider under each guideline. The\nfollowing mitigating conditions under Guideline H are most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 15\u201317 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n42\n AG \u00b6 15. \n43\n10\nAnd under Guideline J, the following mitigating conditions are most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment\nrecord, or constructive community involvement.\nAfter considering the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions, the central\nissue is whether Applicant presented sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation to\nmitigate and overcome the obvious security concerns under both guidelines. I conclude\nthat she has done so. Her drug abuse and related criminal conduct ceased more than\nten years ago in 2000. She has accomplished much since, such as: (1) a long-term\nrelationship with a drug-free gentleman; (2) full-time employment in the print industry for\nmany years; (3) a good employment record; (4) disassociation from her drug-using\nassociates along with reestablishing relationships with family members; (5) regular\nparticipation in her church and church-related activities; (6) satisfactory participation in a\nrecognized drug treatment program for many years, which is ongoing; and (7) a\nfavorable prognosis from the drug treatment program. Viewing these circumstances as\npoints on a graph or scale, the overall trend is both positive and upward. The evidence\nas a whole supports a conclusion of a long-term record of reform and rehabilitation\nbeginning in 2000 and continuing to present.    \n2.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be\n42\nquestioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall\nconcern under Guideline E is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n43\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\u2013(9). \n44\n11\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is whether Applicant made deliberately false statements when\nanswering three questions about her police record on her 2008 security clearance\napplication. Based on the evidence, to include her hearing testimony, which I found\ncredible, I am not persuaded she made deliberately false statements. In response to\nQuestion 23a, she did not report the 1995 burglary charge, which was dismissed,\nbecause she did not recall it. In response to Question 23d, she did not report the\npossession of drug paraphernalia charges because she misunderstood the question.\nAnd in response to Question 23f, she did not report the 2002 assault charge, which was\ndismissed, because she did not remember it. Moreover, by answering in the affirmative\nto other questions on the application, she put the Government on notice of her past drug\nabuse and related criminal conduct. I am not persuaded that Applicant was attempting\nto mislead or conceal information in order to put her security clearance application in a\nmore favorable light.   \n3.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have considered this case in light of the evidence as a whole and the nine-\nfactor whole-person concept.  In particular, I considered the nature, extent, and\n44\nseriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; the age when she was introduced to drug abuse and her\nage at the time of the conduct; the presence of rehabilitation and other positive\nchanges; and the likelihood of recurrence of the drug abuse and related criminal\nconduct. \nWith those factors in mind, a thoughtful balancing of the evidence requires that\nwe view Applicant in the totality of her acts, both negative and positive, past and\npresent, and look below the surface of the case, which is not attractive, to make a\nthorough assessment and evaluation of Applicant\u2019s current security suitability. For many\nyears now, she has engaged in a controlled,  monitored, and lawful program to abstain\nfrom drug abuse, she is succeeding in this regard, and she has a favorable prognosis.\nDuring this period, she has not engaged in drug abuse or related criminal conduct. This\nlengthy period amounts to substantial evidence of reform and rehabilitation, and it is\npersuasive evidence. I base this conclusion, in part, on my opportunity to observe her\ndemeanor and listen to her testimony during the course of a three-hour hearing. Her full,\nfrank, and candid testimony, coupled with her simple dignity throughout the hearing,\npersuades me that her drug abuse and related criminal conduct are safely in the past\nand unlikely to recur.  \n\n Decided for Applicant because it merely alleges a minor traffic violation in 2006 (failure to obey traffic control\n45\ndevice), which was dismissed; it was not a criminal offense. See Exhibit 6 at 1\u20132. \n12\nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to overcome the security\nconcerns, and I am persuaded that she will exercise the required good judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.j: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraphs 2.f\u20132.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 2.j:\nWithdrawn\nSubparagraph 2.k:\nFor Applicant45\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 3.a\u20133.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old data miner working for a defense contractor. She has earned a bachelor of science degree in material science and engineering. She is married and has four minor children. Applicant was married in 1995. Applicant\u2019s husband was a finance manager of a car dealership, which required him to work many long hours away from his family. By the early 2000s, he supplemented their income by working for a family business part- time while Applicant worked as a senior analyst for a technology company. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s workload and schedule became overwhelming. Applicant and her husband decided that he should devote his full time to the family business, which he did in early 2004. Around the same time, in May 2004, the couple had a son. After the child was born, it was discovered that the infant had congenital heart defects and had Down Syndrome.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn an undated answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the three\nallegations set forth under Guideline F and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 19, 2010. The parties\nproposed a hearing date of March 18, 2010. A notice setting that date for the hearing\nwas issued on February 26, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant gave\ntestimony and presented seven documents, which were accepted into evidence without\nobjection as exhibits (Exs.) A-G. Department Counsel offered five documents, which\nwere admitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5 without objection. Applicant was given until April\n15, 2010, to submit any additional materials. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the\nproceeding on March 24, 2010. On April 8, 2010, and April 13, 2010, respectively,\nSeptember 20, 2010\n\n Tr. 11-12; Ex.

H-I. The record was then closed. Based on a review of the\ntestimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet her burden in\nmitigating security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 40-year-old data miner working for a defense contractor. She has\nearned a bachelor of science degree in material science and engineering. She is\nmarried and has four minor children. \nApplicant was married in 1995. Applicant\u2019s husband was a finance manager of a\ncar dealership, which required him to work many long hours away from his family. By\nthe early 2000s, he supplemented their income by working for a family business part-\ntime while Applicant worked as a senior analyst for a technology company. Applicant\u2019s\nhusband\u2019s workload and schedule became overwhelming. Applicant and her husband\ndecided that he should devote his full time to the family business, which he did in early\n2004. Around the same time, in May 2004, the couple had a son. After the child was\nborn, it was discovered that the infant had congenital heart defects and had Down\nSyndrome.  These medical issues took Applicant \u201con a whirlwind of appointments,\n1\ntesting, and exams which led to the creation of bills and a lot of time off from work.\nAlthough it was tight, [they] were able to maintain [their] bills for the most part.\u201d  The\n2\nfamily waited to see if the holes in their child\u2019s heart would heal without surgery. They\ndid not. Surgery was performed in July 2005, weeks after Applicant discovered she was\nagain pregnant. Applicant stayed at home to care for the child under the Family Medical\nLeave Act, which provided her with a job when she returned to the workplace, but did\nnot provide her with any compensation while on leave.  The procedure and Applicant\u2019s\n3\npost-surgery care-giving \u201cwas a crucial point in [their] financial life and caused [her] to\nmake several arrangements with creditors to ensure that some payments were made.\u201d  \n4\nIn January 2006, Applicant had to take maternity leave for the birth of her next\nchild. At the time, her husband was working for a new business full-time, but the work\nwas seasonal. After Applicant returned to work in the spring of 2006, she and her\nhusband were hit with the full impact of child care for their four children. Child care for\nher children, including special needs services, cost approximately $2,000 per month.5\nTheir work, parental obligations, medical care, and other stress factors were\n\n Tr. 13. Applicant noted \u201c[i]n fact, it was just a few months ago [that] I found a box of mail dated 2006 that\n      6\nI had never opened.\u201d\n Tr. 14.\n      7\n Ex. A (Statement) at 2.\n      8\n Tr. 14-15.\n      9\n Tr. 15.\n      10\n Tr. 47-48, 54.\n      11\n Tr. 80.\n      12\n3\noverwhelming.  While they were able to maintain their home, vehicles, and provide for\n6\ntheir family, their \u201ccredit suffered greatly because [they] were unable to pay anything\nbesides the necessities.\u201d7\nAround 2007, Applicant\u2019s financial situation began to stabilize and improve.8\nBecause of his developmental disabilities, Applicant\u2019s son with medical issues was\naccepted into school at the age of two-and-a-half, reducing Applicant\u2019s financial\nobligation to only after-school care during the school year. In 2009, further financial\nrelief was received when the child was approved for a Social Security program. The\nprogram provides him medically necessary garments and an attendant who cares for\nhim after school and in summers.  Applicant\u2019s two oldest children now attend school full\n9\ntime and no longer require day or after-school care. Presently, Applicant only pays for\none child, her youngest, to attend preschool. Meanwhile, Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s family\nbusiness has grown each year. His income varies due to the seasonal nature of some\nof the business\u2019 projects. To enhance their income, he is also working a part-time job.\nApplicant\u2019s salary has increased through promotions and a recent job change. Her\nstrategy for honoring their delinquent debt is to pay off her old debts \u201cone at a time.\u201d10\nShe has no significant medical debt, due in equal parts to good insurance and her\nmaking it a priority.  \n11\nApplicant and her husband own three homes. One is a modest property in a\ndistant state worth about $12,000. They are current on their mortgage payments of\nabout $99 a month. The property is a rental and they have a reliable tenant paying\n$250 a month. They have a second rental property they bought in 2002 as a residence\nin an area neighboring their current state of residence. They had a loyal tenant in the\nproperty until late 2007. It was then without a tenant for about a year, causing a drain\non Applicant\u2019s finances. It is now occupied, but the tenant is about three months behind\nin rent payments.  Applicant and her husband have kept current on their monthly\n12\nmortgage payments of about $670 on the property. The second rental generates about\n$1,200 a month when occupied. Their main residence was financed through a\nmortgage. They are behind on their mortgage payment amounts, but have been making\nregular payments on the mortgage. An equity line was taken to help meet their debts in\nthe late 2000s. It is at issue in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c, below.  \n\n Tr. 51-52.\n      13\n Ex.

It is a collection agency on a\ncredit card balance toward which Applicant could no longer make payments in 2005 or\n2006.   By letter of August 28, 2009, Applicant was advised that collection for the\n13\njudgment was being handled by a law firm and that the firm would accept a reasonable\nproposal to pay the judgment.  Applicant tried to contact the firm, but without success.\n14\nThe phone number on the letter for the now defunct entity is inoperative, \u201cwhich has\ncaused big problems with people.\u201d  Applicant contacted the underlying creditor for\n15\nwhich the law firm had been providing collection services. She learned that a new law\noffice took over the account in January 2010. Applicant called this law firm and was told\nto contact another law office. On April 6, 2010, Applicant was told that the law firm\ncontracted to handle the collection for the new law office \u201cwould require a payoff in 2\nyears or less in the event [she] could not settle for 70% of the $10,000 balance. [The\ncontractor] said he could offer [her] a payment arrangement of $1000 down with a\npayment of around $450 per month for the next two years.\u201d  Applicant and her\n16\nhusband decided they were able to accept the offer and \u201cmake a down payment of\n$1,000 and pay 24 equal payments of the remaining balance for the next two years to\nsettle the debt,\u201d noting they would soon be contacting the contractor to confirm that\ntheir offer will be accepted.17\n1.b \u2013 Account past due ($165) \u2013 Account current \u2013 The account is now current.18\n1.c \u2013 Charged-off mortgage account ($52,639) \u2013 Awaiting modification \u2013 This account\nis for a home equity loan on Applicant\u2019s residence. At the suggestion of the creditor,\nApplicant requested a loan modification under the recently enacted Home Affordable\nModification Program (HAMP). On January 26, 2010, their request was temporarily\nhalted pending submission of a hardship affidavit and an IRS Form 4506-T (Request for\nTranscript of Tax Return).  Applicant has been making $584 monthly payments on this\n19\naccount since October 2009 because she is unsure whether a home equity loan is\n\n Tr. 71; Ex.

Applicant provided evidence\n21\nof payments made while she awaits a decision on her HAMP request. Payments of\n$584 are shown as paid in August 2009, February 2010, and March 2010.22\nApplicant currently earns approximately $82,000 a year, which would yield a\ngross monthly income of about $6,833.  Her husband\u2019s salary varies by season, with a\n23\nnet average of about $1,200 per month. They have other income of about $1,450 per\nmonth. Their monthly expenses are about $3,315 per month, with payments toward\ndebt of approximately $3273. .They have a monthly net remainder of about $291,\n24\nincluding budgeted payments for the debts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and\nothers. They have no automobile payments. Applicant does not have a savings\naccount, although she and her husband have a reserve checking account with a\nbalance of about $800.  Applicant has a 401k account with approximately $20,000.\n25\nShe is living \u201ca little bit paycheck-to-paycheck.\u201d  Applicant has not received financial\n26\ncounseling.27\nAt work, Applicant is known as an individual who is \u201cgenerous, kind-hearted,\nhonest, and loyal,\u201d with a \u201cremarkable\u201d work ethic.  Within her community, she is\n28\nknown as \u201ca hard worker, a fair and sensitive leader, and a delightful person.\u201d  She has\n29\nbeen commended for her volunteering with youth groups.30\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Jan. 27, 1995).\n      32\n Id.\n      33\n6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n31\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n32\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n33\n\n Id.\n      34\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      35\n7\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.34\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this AG that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The guideline sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here,\n35\nApplicant admitted to delinquent debt in excess of $63,000. To date, the overwhelming\nmajority of that debt remains outstanding. Such facts are sufficient to raise Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). With\nsuch conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case against him\nand mitigate security concerns. \nThe majority of the debts at issue were acquired when Applicant\u2019s son was born\nin 2005 with extraordinary health issues which required major surgery in 2006. As a\nresult, she had to take leave without pay to care for the recovering infant. Soon\nthereafter, she was forced to take temporary maternity leave in anticipation of the birth\nof another child in 2007. Such factors give rise to Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). To the\nextent those same factors, as well as the sudden vacancy by a long-term renter of her\nrental property in late 2007, adversely affected Applicant\u2019s ability to address all of her\ndebts, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies in part. \nAlthough Applicant testified that she and her husband have been trying to\naddress their delinquent debts \u201cone debt at a time\u201d since their finances stabilized after\n2007, there is no evidence that she has tried to address her debts in a systematic or\nholistic manner. She has a budget in place that includes payment on some debts,\nincluding the debts noted at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c, as well as others, but\n\n8\nthere is no evidence, for example, of timely, consistent monthly payments on the debt\nat \u00b6 1.c. The evidence provided only reflects three payments on that account in the past\nyear. Financial counseling is clearly warranted, but it has not been pursued, obviating\napplication of FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol).\n The SOR was issued on November 4, 2009. Since that time, the collection entity\nfor the debt noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a went out of business before Applicant\nresponded to their August 2009 letter; Applicant made only two of three demonstrated\npayments on the past due account reflected in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.b; and she sought a\nhome loan modification for the debt reflected at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c.  To her credit,\nshe has recently persisted in locating the current creditor for the debt noted at SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.a, but there is scant evidence of effective progress on the debts reflected\nat SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c for the five months following her receipt of the SOR.\nTo the extent the SOR prompted her to try addressing her two largest debts, however,\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies in part.\nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the conditions surrounding the\nacquisition of her delinquent debt. While she testified that things have improved\nfinancially since 2007, however, there is scant evidence of subsequent and effective\nattempts to address her two largest delinquent debts in a timely and organized manner.\nA minor past-due balance is now addressed. However, she only demonstrated three\nerratic payments and preliminary paperwork regarding an application for a home loan\nmodification for one debt, and expressed only an intent to enter into a repayment plan\non the other. Until those two delinquent debts are effectively in repayment and\nApplicant\u2019s finances are more organized, financial considerations security concerns\nremain.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based on careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible and educated woman. She is a devoted mother and wife.\nShe has demonstrated exceptional maternal concern and care for her son. \nApplicant\u2019s situation is atypical to the extent that her financial issues are not the\nresult of overspending, a lifestyle beyond her means, or investments that soured in a\npoor economy. In fact, she has two rental properties. While one property went unrented\n\n9\nfor a year, both properties reap rental incomes that exceed their monthly mortgage\npayments. As such, they represent not only sound investments, but untouched potential\nassets with liquidation potential in times of need. One former residence, which was\nunrented for a year recently, also represents a potential sanctuary should they choose\nto sell their home. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s debts are not directly related to her child\u2019s medical care,\ndue to good insurance coverage and the fact she made such bills a priority. The debts\nat issue seem to have mainly derived from Applicant\u2019s medical leave to care for her son\nin 2006, her 2007 maternity leave, child care costs, and the lack of a tenant in one\nrental property for a one-year period between late 2007 and 2008.\nApplicant stated, however, that her family finances started to stabilize and\nimprove in 2007. There is no evidence showing that she tried to work with the three\ncreditors at issue in 2008 or early 2009, even though she and her husband had an\nincome in excess of $100,000. No substantial efforts to address the two major debts at\nissue appear to have been exerted until the time the SOR was issued. By not\nresponding to the law firm initially handling the debt noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a in a\ntimely manner, Applicant was left to track down the current creditor on her own. This\nprotracted her ability work on the debt or negotiate a payment plan. The payments\nshown on the account noted at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.c have been erratic. She has not\nreceived financial counseling or, apparently, adhered to her written budget. There is no\nevidence she has considered bankruptcy, sale of one of the rental properties, or moving\nto their former residence. Such facts do not demonstrate a concerted effort to\neffectively address the two largest debts at issue.\nAs noted, Applicant was a credible witness. Her reputation is as a hard working\nand diligent person. Given her household income, her debts are not insurmountable,\nbut she agrees she is living paycheck-to-paycheck. At present, the evidence does not\nindicate sufficient progress to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. The \n\u2018clearly consistent\n\u2018 standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on\nthe side of denials. In light of the evidence presented, clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 28, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Standard\nForm 86), on November 6, 2008. (Item 5.) On November 2, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an undated Answer to the SOR, and requested that a\ndecision be made without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) to Applicant on February 22, 2010. Applicant received the FORM on\nMarch 2, 2010, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. Applicant\nsubmitted additional information on March 12, 2010. Department Counsel did not object\nto my considering this information, and it is admitted into the record as Applicant Exhibit\n\n2\nA. The case was assigned to me on March 26, 2010. Based upon a review of the written\nrecord, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 46, and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits all the factual allegations in the SOR. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\n 1.a.\nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $338. He submitted documentary evidence from the creditor stating that this\naccount was settled in November 2009. (Item 4 at 2-3.)\n1.b.\nApplicant admitted that he owed $3,450 for a past due account. He\nsubmitted evidence showing that he has a payment arrangement with this creditor, and\nthat he has been making consistent monthly payments to the creditor in fulfilment of that\narrangement. This debt has been reduced to $2,100. (Item 4 at 4-5; Applicant Exhibit A\nat 2.)\n1.c.\nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $268. He submitted documentary evidence from the creditor stating that this\naccount was settled in September 2009. (Item 4 at 6-7.)\n1.d.\nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $962. He submitted evidence showing that he has a payment arrangement\nwith this creditor, and that he has been making consistent monthly payments to the\ncreditor in fulfilment of that arrangement. Applicant states in Applicant Exhibit A that this\nitem has now been paid in full. (Item 4 at 8-9.)\n1.e.\nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $298. He submitted documentary evidence from the creditor stating that this\naccount was settled in June 2009. (Item 4 at 10-11.)\n1.f.\nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to a collection agency in the\namount of $275. He submitted documentary evidence stating that this account was\nsettled in November 2009. (Item 4 at 12-13.)\n1.g.\nApplicant admitted that he was indebted to a home builder for a deficiency\nbalance on a foreclosed mortgage account in the amount of $20,3100. This company\nwas the defendant in a class action lawsuit concerning its actions with regards to people\n\n3\nlike the Applicant. Applicant is a Class Member. The \u201cFinal Order & Judgement\nApproving Settlement, Certifying Settlement Class, and Dismissing Action\u201d states, in\npart:\n12. Defendant [home builder] shall (a) forego all collection efforts and\nwaive its right to collect from and sue Class Members for deficiency\nbalances on the Accounts, and refrain from assigning, selling, transferring,\nor otherwise attempting to collect from Class Members for the deficiency\nbalances, (b) request the Credit Reporting Agencies to delete the trade\nline associated with the Account of each Class Member for whom\nsufficient identifying information is contained in Defendant\u2019s readily\nsearchable computer media, to the extent such trade line is present, and\ncease all credit reporting on the Accounts of Class Members to the Credit\nReporting Agencies. (Item 9 at 4-5.)\nThis debt has been resolved by this law suit. (Item 4 at 14-22, Item 6 at 6-7, and\nItem 9.) (See Footnote 8 in FORM.)\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. His financial difficulties arose\nprimarily because of unemployment issues. (Item 6 at 4-7.) In his response to Financial\nInterrogatories, he submitted documentary evidence that he had resolved several\nadditional debts beyond those listed in the SOR. (Item 6 at 12-17, 23, and 26.) He also\nsubmits that he is \u201cattending free counseling [sic] and debt management education\u201d\nclasses. (Applicant Exhibit A at 2.) \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from his current supervisor, and a\npast supervisor. Both state that he has kept his employer fully informed about his\nfinancial situation, that he is an asset to the employer, and recommend that he receive a\nsecurity clearance. (Applicant Exhibit A at 4-5.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n5\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, had over $25,000 in past due\ndebts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nAs stated above, Applicant=s financial difficulties arose primarily because of\nunemployment issues. He documented serious and long-standing attempts to resolve\nhis past due debts. The record shows that he has paid all but one of his legitimate\ndebts, and that the remaining debt is not being collected by the creditor due to a law\nsuit. At all times he has acted responsibly. These two mitigating conditions apply.\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. As stated above,\nall but one have been paid. Indeed, he paid several debts before issuance of the SOR.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He is able to pay his current\nindebtedness in a timely manner. I find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had some\nfinancial problems, but his current financial condition is stable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), I\nhave considered the facts of the Applicant\u2019s debt history. He has worked hard over the\npast year to resolve all of his indebtedness. Based on the record, I find that there have\nbeen permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, I find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and\nthat there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nOn August 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nAppellant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline \nG (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 8, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On October 9, 2009, DOHA assigned the case \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nto another administrative judge, and reassigned it to me on October 22, 2009.  DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on October 29, 2009. The case was heard on November 19, \n2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n16 in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A \nin evidence without objection. The record remained open until December 3, 2009, to \ngive Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documents. Applicant timely \nsubmitted four exhibits that I marked as AE B through E and admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on December 2, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations contained in \u00b6 1 of \nthe SOR and \u00b6 2(b). He denied all other allegations. His admissions are incorporated \ninto the following findings of fact concerning all the allegations: \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and married since April 2003. He has three children, \nages, 5, 3, and 18 months. He has earned some college credits. He honorably served in \nthe U.S. Marines from 1996 until June 2000. He was recalled to active duty in \nNovember 2001 and served until June 2004 as a sergeant. After being recalled to active \nduty, Applicant deployed to a very volatile city in Iraq and served in combat. He was a \nsmall computer systems specialist and held a clearance throughout his military career. \n(Tr. 60.) He was awarded the Combat Action Ribbon for his service in Iraq. (Tr. 28-29.) \nSince his discharge, he has worked for federal contractors in the area of information \ntechnology. He began a position as a Defense Information Assurance Certification and \nAccreditation Process (DIECAP) Engineer with his current employer in October 2008, \nperforming work for the U.S. Army. (Tr. 31.)  \n \n \nApplicant completed three security clearance applications: (1) a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF-86) on July 8, 1996 (GE 7);1 (2) a Standard Form 86 \n(SF-86) on April 18, 2005 (GE 9); and (3) an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on October 16, 2008 (GE 1). He completed a Declaration for \nFederal Employment (DFE) on May 16, 2005. (GE 10.) He found the forms confusing \nand did not receive assistance while completing them. (Tr. 36).  \n \n  \nOn December 1, 2007, DOHA issued Applicant a SOR raising security concerns \nunder Guidelines E and Guideline J. (GE 15.). Applicant answered that SOR on \nDecember 18, 2007. (GE 16.) Subsequent to filing the SOR, Applicant\u2019s employer \nreassigned him to a position that did not require a clearance, resulting in the termination \nof the hearing process. (Tr. 63.) The allegations raised in the August 2009 SOR \nessentially re-allege the Guideline E and Guideline J allegations contained in the \nDecember 2007 SOR.   \n                                                     \n1After Applicant submitted this security clearance application, the Navy acknowledged a 1992 \nDUI, a March 1993 Careless Driving charge, and a May 1995 charge for Minor in Possession, and \nrecommended issuance of a security clearance. On July 2, 1997, the adjudicator of the case stated that \n\u201cAlthough subject has been involved in three reported incidents (two alcohol related), it has been two \nyears since last incident. Subject\u2019s behavior can also be attributed to immaturity.\u201d (GE 8.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at the age of 17. He drank several beers four \nor five times a month during high school. After joining the Marines, he increased the \nfrequency and amount of alcohol he consumed. (GE 3) He drank six to twelve beers \nwhen he was off duty. (Tr. 72.) His alcohol consumption decreased substantially in June \n2000, when he left military service after his first enlistment.  From then until June 2004, \nhe consumed alcohol two or three times a week, having one or two beers. After his \ndischarge in June 2004, he began consuming greater amounts of alcohol on a daily \nbasis. (GE 3.) He admitted that up to August 2009, he periodically consumed alcohol to \nthe point of intoxication.  (Tr. 34.)  \n \n \n Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents. In 1992, he was arrested \nand charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) when he was 17 years old and in \nhigh school. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of Operating Under Influence Liquor \nand was sentenced to community service and fined. He and his friends had been \nconsuming alcohol at a party before the arrest. (GE 3.) He reported this arrest on his \nJuly 1996 SF-86. (GE 7.) \n \n   \nIn 1995, Applicant was charged with Minor in Possession (MIP) (of alcohol) after \nhe and his friends were stopped by the police. They had been consuming alcohol at a \nbar. (Tr. 66.) He was 20 years old.  He pleaded guilty and was fined. (Tr. 38.) He \nreported this charge on his July 1996 SF-86. (GE 7.) \n \n \nIn May 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault and Drunk and \nDisorderly Conduct after he became embroiled in an altercation outside his barracks \nwith a taxi driver about a fare. (Tr. 68.) He had been consuming alcohol before the \narrest. (Tr. 69.) He received a Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP) and a 30-day restriction \nto his barracks that was suspended. His promotion to corporal (E-4) was delayed for \nthree months. (Tr. 39.) More than a year later, in July 1999, Applicant was ordered to \nattend a five-day inpatient treatment program as a result of this charge. He complied \nwith the order. (Tr. 40-41; GE 5.)  He was 24 years old.  \n \n \nIn March 1999, Applicant, along with three other Marines, was arrested by local \npolice and charged with Open Container of liquor. They spent the night in jail. He paid a \n$250 to $350 fine and was released the following day. He was not consuming alcohol in \nthe car at the time of the arrest, but had been drinking in a bar prior to getting into the \ncar. (Tr. 39-40; GE 3.)   \n \n  \nIn May 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Stealing, Felony, and \n(2) Fraud Credit Device, Felony. He was found guilty in March 2003, and given a \nSuspended Imposition of Sentence with five years probation. Prior to the arrest, he had \nbeen living with his girlfriend, whom he claimed authorized his use of her credit card on \noccasion. (Tr. 74.) He broke up with her in April 2001 and was arrested ten days later. \n(Tr. 48.). The matter was not resolved until March 2003 because he was deployed in \nSeptember 2001. (Tr. 48-50.) He completed the probationary term in 2008. (Tr. 50.) He \ndid not list this arrest on the April 2005 SF-86, but did list it on the October 2008 SF-86. \n(GE 9, 1.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant met a government investigator to discuss his use of \nalcohol and any undisclosed incidents relating to it. Applicant disclosed the 1992 and \n1995 charges. He told the investigator that he did not include them on the April 2005 \nSF-86 because he thought they were outside the seven-year time frame of Question 23. \nHe acknowledged that he misread the questions, but emphasized that he did not \nintentionally fail to disclose them. (GE 3 at 76.)  He also discussed and disclosed the \n1998 NJP. (Id.)  \n \n \nFrom April 26, 2007, to April 30, 2007, Applicant entered a treatment program for \nalcohol abuse after he ceased drinking for three days and experienced alcohol \nwithdrawal. Prior to his admission, he was consuming six to twelve beers on a daily \nbasis. (Tr. 43; GE 12.) A physician subsequently diagnosed him as Alcohol Dependent \nand Diabetic. (GE 14.) After leaving inpatient treatment, he immediately entered a five-\nday recovery program with a recommendation that he attend at least three AA meetings \nper week. (GE 14.) According to the Discharge summary, \u201che made good progress for \nthe short time he was here. He successfully completed treatment.\u201d (GE 14 at 62.) He \nreceived a \u201cFair\u201d prognosis. (Id.) He remained sober from April 26, 2007, to March 2008, \nand then began consuming alcohol on a regular basis. (Tr. 44, 92.) He continued to \nattend AA sporadically. In December 2008, he decided to stop consuming alcohol, \nwhich he did for periods of time, and also ceased attending AA.  (Tr. 45, 93.)  \n \n \nIn July 2009, Applicant was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD), as a result of his combat experience in Iraq. (Tr. 101.) He believes that the \ndeployment may have increased his consumption of alcohol, but cannot conclude that it \nis the sole reason for his previous drinking habits. (Tr. 102, 105.) He has participated in \nfive to ten psychotherapy sessions for PTSD. He now attends sessions once a month, \nin addition to participating in AA. \n \n \nOn September 4, 2009, Applicant voluntarily entered a substance abuse \ntreatment program because \u201cit became clear that I needed to seek professional \nassistance for my substance abuse.\u201d (Tr. 46.). He again received a diagnosis of Alcohol \nDependent. He was discharged on September 18, 2009.  According to the Discharge \nSummary, he \u201cleft in stable and improving condition\u201d with a recommendation to continue \nindividual therapy, attend AA, and obtain a sponsor. (AE B.), He has attended AA \nmeetings every day since then.  His date of sobriety is August 30, 2009. By the time of \nthe hearing, he had been sober for 80 days. (Tr. 34-35) His AA Sponsor, also a Marine \nveteran, strongly supports his recovery progress and efforts. (AE E.) Applicant admitted \nthat he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 36.) His command and employer are aware of his treatment \nfor alcohol abuse.2 (Tr. 97.) \n \n \nApplicant takes full responsibility for his behavior. (Tr. 103-105.) He is fully \ncommitted to sobriety, a program of abstinence, and AA. Although he received \ntreatment for alcoholism in April 2007, he did not fully commit to recovery until August \n                                                     \n2 After his voluntary admission, Applicant self-reported his conduct to the Command and his \nemployer because he knew \u201cthat it would have some impact on the security clearance proceedings.\u201d (Tr. \n34.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2009 when he realized that his diabetic Type 2 condition was related to his alcohol \nconsumption. It took him time to admit his alcoholism . (Tr. 105-108.)    \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified three answers on his April 18, 2005 SF-\n86, one answer on his October 16, 2008 e-QIP, and one answer on the May 16, 2005 \nDFE. Applicant repeatedly denied that he intentionally failed to disclose requested \ninformation. (Tr. 52.) He did not have any assistance in completing the forms. \n \n  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a) In response to Section 23: Your Police Record: \u201c(d) Have you ever \nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs,\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d on the April 2005 SF-86. He did not disclose the March 1999 alcohol \ncharge. In his Answer to the 2007 SOR, he stated that he did not disclose this incident \non the April 2005 SF 86 because he thought it was more than seven years old and \noutside the requested time frame.3 (GE 9) He testified that it was an obvious oversight. \n(Tr. 53.) Although this question does not include a time frame, his confusion is plausible, \ngiven the seven-year time frame listed in two of the questions in this section. His \nexplanation is credible. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 3.b) In response to Section 23: Your Police Record: \u201c(e) In the last 7 \nyears, have you been subject to court marital or other disciplinary proceedings under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice?\u201d (include non-judicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.),\u201d \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d on the April 2005 SF-86. He did not disclose the May 1998 \nNon-Judicial Punishment. He thought the incident also fell outside a seven-year time \nframe. (Tr. 53; GE 16.) His explanation is credible, as the incident occurred one month \nshort of the seven-year time frame. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 3.c) In response to Section 23: Your Police Record: \u201c(f) In the last 7 \nyears, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not \nlisted in response to a, b, c, d, or e above?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d on the April 2005 \nSF-86. He did not disclose the May 2001 arrest. According to his answer to the \nDecember 2007 SOR, he stated that he did not disclose the information \u201cbecause of the \nconditions of that court proceeding. I was informed by the judge that this would be \nremoved from my record if I had no problems with the law for the next 5 years.\u201d (GE 16.) \nHe did not think that he was convicted because he received a suspended sentence. (Tr. \n54-55.) During his testimony, he admitted it was an oversight and not an intentional \nmisrepresentation. (Tr. 84.)  His explanation is credible.  \n \n \nDuring cross-examination, Department Counsel asked Applicant why he \nanswered Sections 23(a) and (c) in the negative. After reading Section 23(a) at the \nhearing, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony,\u201d Applicant stated \nthat he thinks that he overlooked the word \u201ccharged\u201d and \u201cconcentrated on the word \n\u2018convicted.\u2019\u201d (Tr. 82) In response to Section 23(c): \u201cAre there currently any charges \npending against you for any criminal offense,\u201d he answered \u201cno.\u201d He did not understand \n                                                     \n3Section 23 on the April 2005 SF-86 includes six questions. Sections 23(a) through (d) inquire \nabout charges in general; Sections 23(d) and (e) limit inquiry into specific areas \u201cIn the last 7 years\u201d. (GE \n9.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthat the charges were still pending in April 2005 as he had received a suspended \nsentence in 2003 and thought the matter was legally resolved.4  (Tr. 83.) His \nexplanation is credible. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 3.d) In response to Question 9, \u201cDuring the last 10 years, have you been \nconvicted, been imprisoned, been on probation, or been on parole? (Includes felonies \nfirearms or explosives violations misdemeanors and all other offenses.),\u201d on the May \nDFE, he answered \u201cno.\u201d (GE 10.) He did not list the March 1999 arrest or the May 2001 \noffense. The Department Counsel acknowledged that Applicant was not required to \ndisclose the March 1999 arrest because it did not result in a conviction. (Tr. 86.) When \nasked why he did not list the 2003 felony on the Declaration for Federal Employment, \nhe said, \u201cThis would have been an oversight. I just now actually saw the word \n\u2018probation\u2019 on there. Because it was my understanding that I was not convicted, I was \nnot imprisoned or on probation. I didn\u2019t see the [word] probation and I definitely was not \non parole at the time.\u201d (Tr. 56.)  His explanation is credible, in view of the explanations \nhe articulated regarding his responses to the 2005 SF-86, which he completed a month \nbefore. \n \n \n(SOR \u00b6 3.e) In response to Section 23: Your Police Record: (a) Have you ever \nbeen charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice),\u201d on the October 2008 e-QIP, he answered \u201cyes.\u201d He disclosed \nthe April 2001 felony, as requested, and gave an explanation of the charge, but did not \nincluded information about the suspended sentence or the probationary term he \nreceived. He assumed that \u201cprobation may be a part of any sentencing.\u201d (Tr. 88.) He \nthought that because the probationary term had terminated earlier in the year, it was not \nnecessary to list it. (Tr. 86.) He disclosed sufficient information to comply with the \ndisclosure requirements of said question. \n \n \nAfter listening to Applicant testify and observing his demeanor, I find that his \nexplanations for failing to disclose specific information, as to the allegations set forth in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, 3.c., 3.d, and 3.e, are credible. In response to a general question \nabout these omissions, he stated, \u201cAgain I don\u2019t recall some of these documents being \nactually filled out. I recall the documents. But it\u2019s never my intention to willfully deceive \nthe Government or the Department of Defense.\u201d (Tr. 106.) \n \n \nApplicant was candid and remorseful about his past behavior. He takes full \nresponsibility for his problems. During his closing argument, he emphasized his military \nservice and dedication to this country. He stated: \n \nThe simple fact remains for me is the fact that I have willfully and \nknowledgeably, knowingly put my life actually on the line in defense of this \ncountry. And there is no greater sacrifice that I think anybody can make \nother that that, other than to die for country in combat. (Tr. 114-115.) \n \n                                                     \n4Applicant\u2019s negative answers to these two questions are not included in the SOR as falsification \nallegations.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters from his project manager and team leader, strongly \nsupporting his request for reinstatement of his security clearance and addressing his \nintegrity and work ethic. His project manager has known him since October 2008. In a \nNovember 25, 2009 letter, he wrote: \n \nIn addition to his tireless effort, [Appellant] is a consummate team player \nwho goes the extra mile for his colleagues. I would rank him in the top 5% \nof all employees I have worked with and wish I could find ten more like \nhim. I served as a Non-commissioned Officer in the US Army where I was \ndeployed in support of Operation Iraqi Enduring Freedom. I can honestly \nsay that there is no one I would rather have in my foxhole than [Appellant]. \n(AE D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s team leader for the past year stated in his November 25, 2009 letter \nthat he ranks Applicant \u201cas one of the top performers within the ACA Office. (AE C) \nThey are aware of his alcohol issues. (Tr. 97.) \n \n \n \n \nIn his Closing Argument, Applicant stated, \u201cI put my country first in every ordeal, \nevery matter. And there would never, ever be anything in my life that I would trade: any \nknowledge that I maintained from the Department of Defense with anybody else.\u201d (Tr. \n114.) He went on to say that \u201ctoday\u2019s a lot different than it was in 2005 when I filled out \nthose documents. My life\u2019s a lot different. I am sober today . . . I do my job with the \nutmost diligence, the utmost respect for the Department of Army and the Department of \nDefense.\u201d (Tr. 115.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set \nout in AG \u00b6 21: \n Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns \nunder four Guideline G Disqualifying Conditions (DCs) as set forth in AG \u00b6 22:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents \nof concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; and \n (f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. \nApplicant was involved in four criminal incidents involving alcohol: 1992, 1995, \n1998, and 1999. DC 22(a) is established. Applicant consumed alcohol periodically to the \npoint of impaired judgment, up to August 2009, raising a concern under DC 22(c). In \n2007, a physician diagnosed Applicant as Alcohol Dependent. Security concerns under \nDC 22(d) are supported by the record. Subsequent to that diagnosis, Applicant \nrelapsed, establishing a concern under DC 22(f).  \nThe evidence supporting those four disqualifying conditions requires a closer \nexamination and balancing of resulting security concerns with any potentially mitigating \nmatters, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthose concerns. AG \u00b6 23 includes four Mitigating Conditions (MC) that could rebut or \nmitigate security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption:  \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nApplicant\u2019s background includes four alcohol-related incidents that occurred \nbetween 1992 and 1999. Eleven years have passed since the last incident, which \ntrigger the application of MC 23(a) to those allegations. Applicant recognizes his history \n\n \n10 \n \n \nof alcoholism, understands the effect it has on his health and life, and takes \nresponsibility for his actions. He has diligently pursued a program of alcohol \nrehabilitation since August 2009. He successfully completed an inpatient program, \nparticipates in psychotherapy for PTSD, regularly attends AA, works with an AA \nsponsor, and has remained abstinent since the end of August 2009. His efforts warrant \na partial application of MC 23(b) and MC 23(d) given the brevity of his program to date. \nThe evidence does not support the application of MC 23(c).  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  \nApplicant admitted that he was arrested and charged four times for minor \ncriminal infractions between 1992 and 1999, and that he was arrested and convicted of \na felony in 2003 for an incident that occurred in 2001. The evidence is sufficient to \nestablish DC 31(a).  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two mitigating conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising under this guideline: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nMC 32(a) has application. The last criminal arrest occurred in May 2001.  Nine \nyears have passed and there is no evidence of any other criminal allegations. The \nincident involved Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend and occurred under circumstances \nunlikely to recur. That conduct does not cast doubt on his current trustworthiness or \ngood judgment. Applicant provided evidence of on-going rehabilitation for his \nalcoholism, which was related to the four other charges. He has been married for seven \nyears and has three children. He was released from the court-imposed probation in \n\n \n11 \n \n \n2008. His supervisors attest to his current good employment record and integrity. He did \nnot hesitate to express remorse over his conduct and a commitment to monitoring his \nfuture behavior.  MC 32(d) also applies.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concerns pertaining to the personal conduct guideline are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government alleged in SOR \u00b6 3 that Applicant deliberately falsified answers \nto questions on his April 2005 SF-86, May 2005 DFE, and October 2008 SF-86 because \nhe failed to disclose sufficient information about his criminal history. The government \ncontended that those falsifications constituted a potential disqualifying condition under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nAlthough Applicant acknowledged that he did not disclose the information, he \ndenied that he intentionally misled the government. When a falsification allegation is \ncontroverted or denied, as in this case, the government has the burden of proving it.  \nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. \n02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, along with prior evidence of truthful disclosures, consistent \ndenials that he did not intentionally falsify his security clearance forms, seven years of \nmilitary service, statements from his employer regarding his integrity, self-reporting his \ninpatient treatment,  and his confusion and misreading of the questions, is credible. The \nrecord evidence does not establish the allegations of deliberate falsification contained in \nSOR \u00b6 3. This guideline is found in his favor. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 34-year-old mature young \nman, who honorably served the United States Marine Corps for seven years, while \nholding a security clearance. During his last term of duty, he witnessed combat in a \nhostile situation, resulting in a subsequent diagnosis of PTSD. He has been married for \nalmost seven years and has three young children. He does not hesitate to articulate his \nsolid commitment to the defense of the United States. Since leaving military service in \nJune 2004, he has successfully worked for federal contractors that support the U.S. \nArmy. His supervisors are impressed with his work and trust him implicitly. These are \nimpressive facts in his background.  \n \nApplicant also has a history of alcohol-related incidents that occurred between \n1992 and 1999, the last one occurring about ten years ago. He has a 2003 conviction \nfor a felony for an incident that occurred in 2001, nine years ago. He received a \nsuspended sentence and completed a probationary term in 2008. Since his last in-\npatient treatment for alcoholism in August 2009, he has come to terms with his disease, \ndiabetes, PTSD, and the overall effect that these issues have had in his life. He is \nseriously committed to health, recovery, and his family.   \n \nAfter considering all the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s credible \ntestimony, his military career, the presence of rehabilitation and maturity, his employer\u2019s \nsupport, I find that it is unlikely any similar lapse in good judgment involving alcohol or \nother form of misconduct will occur. His criminal problems are behind him. He continues \nto participate in a recovery program for alcohol dependence and PTSD. He candidly \nrecognizes his mistakes and is addressing his character shortcomings. This former \nMarine is not a security risk.  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance at this time. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the alcohol \nconsumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct guidelines. \n \n Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a though 1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 3.a   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 3.b   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n Subparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \n Subparagraph 3.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nOn November 8, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On September 9, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \nMay 25, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 5, 2009, and requested a \nhearing. On January 22, 2010, DOHA assigned the case to me. On February 3, 2010, \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, setting the case for February 23, 2010. The case \nwas heard as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, but did not provide any documentary \nevidence. The record remained open until March 12, 2010, to give Applicant an \nopportunity to submit information. He timely submitted documents that I marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A, B, and C, and admitted into the record without objection from \nDepartment Counsel. DOHA received the hearing transcript on March 3, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.g, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 2.a, and 2.b.  \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. In March 2005, he earned a Master of Business \nAdministration degree. In December 2005, he began a position as a software engineer \nwith his current employer, a defense contractor. From November 2004 until December \n2005, he worked for another defense contractor. He was unemployed from September \n2002 until November 2004, after being laid off. During that two-year period, he had a \nshort-term consulting contract and attended school. (GE 2 at 148.) Prior to September \n2002, he was self-employed. (Id.) He recently completed one year of law school with the \nassistance of educational benefits from his employer. (Tr. 48; GE 1.) \n \n \nPrior to losing his position in late 2002, Applicant earned $175,000 annually. In \n2003, he was unemployed and received about $1,000 per month in unemployment \nbenefits. (Tr. 26.) In 2004 and 2005, he earned about $10,000. In 2006, he began \nearning $90,000 annually at his current position. In 2009, he earned about $101,500. As \nof March 19, 2010, his gross income increased to $117,500, annually. His past two \nyearly performance evaluations noted that he \u201cexceeded expectations.\u201d (Tr. 77.) \n \n \nApplicant is twice divorced. He married his first wife in June 1979 and they \ndivorced in January 1984. He has a 29-year-old daughter from that marriage. In October \n1984, he married his second wife. They filed for a divorce in 2001, which was finalized \nin September 2003, while he was unemployed. He has eight children from that \nmarriage, ages 10 to 26 years old. Six of those children reside with his former spouse in \nanother state and two children are independent. His 17-year-old son is severely \ndisabled.  \n \n \nAccording to the final divorce decree, Applicant is required to pay $1,000 per \nweek in child support, which amount was based on his high earnings from 2001 to \n2002. During the two-year period of unemployment, he accrued $48,000 in arrearage. \nHis current support payments are $1,250 per week and include $250 for arrears. \nDepending on the amount of money he earns in overtime, he pays approximately \n$4,333 to $5,500 in child support each month through a state garnishment order. (Tr. \n39-41; AE C.) He chose not to seek a modification of the child support payments while \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nhe was unemployed because he felt strongly about his obligation to support his children. \n(Tr. 43.) The divorce agreement does not contain any provision for a decrease in \nsupport as his children become independent, which is the situation for his 26 and 24-\nyear-old children. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he has experienced significant financial problems \nand accrued delinquent debts since late 2002. He attributed the situation to the two-year \nperiod of unemployment from 2002 to 2004, a litigious divorce between 2002 and 2003, \nand high medical and educational expenses related to his son\u2019s disabilities. (GE 3 at \n118; Tr. 22-25.)  \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated July 2009 and December 2008, the \nSOR alleged security concerns related to the accumulation of eight delinquent debts \ntotaling $30,749. The status of each of those debts is as follows:  \n \n  \n1. (\u00b6 1.a) In February 2008, the federal Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a \n$20,661 tax lien against Applicant for the tax years of 2000 and 2001, relating \nto his child support deductions, and garnished his wages. In May 2009, he \nentered into a $298 monthly repayment plan with the IRS and the \ngarnishment order was lifted. As of February 2010, the balance on the tax \ndebt is $12,295 and includes a small liability amount for 2006 and 2007. (Tr. \n32-34; AE A.) The debt is being resolved.  \n \n2. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g) These six delinquent debts total $7,800 and remain \nunpaid because Applicant has not had enough money at the end of the month \nto negotiate payments with the creditors. (Tr. 44-45.)  \n \n3. (\u00b6 1.h.) The $2,285 debt is owed to an electric company for his former wife\u2019s \nresidence. According to Applicant\u2019s divorce agreement, the debt is not his \nresponsibility. (Tr. 45; AE B.) This debt is resolved.   \n \nAccording to a March 2010 budget, Applicant has a gross monthly income of \napproximately $9,795. After deducting child support payments, taxes, and insurance, \nhis net income is $2,640 and expenses are $1,637. He makes approximately $818 in \npayments on debts, consisting of the $298 payment to the IRS, and minimal payments \non credit cards, personal loans, and to department stores.1 He has about $185 \nremaining that he could use to make small payments to the six unpaid creditors listed in \nthe SOR. (AE C.) Until his recent salary increase, he could not afford to make any \namount of a monthly payment toward those debts. (Tr. 74.)  \n \n \nIn November 2006, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In response to \u201cSection 24. \nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity: a. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, \n                                            \n1Applicant\u2019s $41,848 student loan is deferred, but is included in his list of outstanding debts \nattached to a March 2009 Personal Financial Statement. (GE 2 at 134.)  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, \nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs,\u201d he answered, \u201cYes,\u201d and \ndisclosed that he used marijuana twice between December 2001 and January 2002. He \nnoted that he had not used it since that time. (GE 1.)  \n \n \n \nIn December 2008, a Government investigator interviewed Applicant. During that \ninterview, the investigator asked him about his marijuana use. Applicant indicated that \nhe used it on two occasions in 1969 and then not again until he separated from his wife \nin December 2001. After reviewing his 2006 e-QIP with the investigator, he noted that \nhe made an error in listing his use of marijuana as two times between December 2001 \nand January 2002. He indicated that he used it more than that and did not intend to \nmislead the government. The investigator recorded that Applicant was uncertain of the \nexact number of times he used it but estimated about 15 times. He smoked it with a \nfriend who purchased it. He used it to relieve stress. (GE 3 at 110.) \n \n \nOn May 27, 2009, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories concerning his \ndrug usage. In response to Question 1a, regarding the history of his marijuana use, \nApplicant estimated that he had a \u201cfew puffs per day\u201d from October 1970 to November \n1970. He estimated that he smoked it on \u201c2 occasions\u201d between December 2001 and \nJanuary 2002. (GE 2 at 126.)  \n \n \nIn July 2009, the Government sent Applicant another set of Interrogatories along \nwith a copy of his December 2008 interview. In a written response to the accuracy of \nthat interview, Applicant wrote, \u201cRegarding marijuana usage, my use on social \noccasions was casual enough to not remember specifics of usage and events in \n10/1970-11/1970 and 12/2001-10/2002.\u201d (GE 3 at 118.) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he intentionally falsified his \nresponse to Section 24 of the e-QIP or to Question 1a in the May 2009 Interrogatories \nby failing to disclose the extent of his marijuana use. He stated that he was going \nthrough a litigious divorce at the time he used marijuana and he did not have an \u201cexact \nrecollection of the specific number of incidences.\u201d (Answer.) \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant denied telling the investigator that he used \nmarijuana 15 times between December 2001 and January 2002. He thinks the \ninvestigator prompted him for an estimated number and arrived at 15 without input from \nhim. He reiterated that he believed he used marijuana about two times, but cannot recall \nwith certainty. (Tr. 56-58.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies that \nbegan in late 2002 and continue to the present, as he does not have the financial ability \nto pay all of his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions.  \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s numerous financial problems \nhave been ongoing for the past seven or eight years. AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial application. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts accrued as a result of two years of unemployment, a \nlitigious divorce, significant medical and educational bills for one child, and large child \nsupport obligations. Those were circumstances beyond his control. However, he did not \npresent evidence that he attempted to responsibly resolve or manage all of the debts \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nduring those times, which is necessary for full application of the mitigating condition. \nApplicant has not obtained credit counseling, but did present his budget, which indicates \nthat many of his obligations, including the alleged IRS debt, are being paid and coming \nunder control. Those facts support the application of AG \u00b6 20(c) to that debt. Applicant \nhas not made a good-faith effort to resolve six delinquent because he does not have \nsufficient income; hence, AG \u00b6 20(d) cannot apply. Applicant provided proof that the \n$2,285 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is not his responsibility, but rather his former wife\u2019s. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies to that debt. There is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 \n20(f).     \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b that Applicant falsified his \nanswers to a question on his e-QIP and a question on the May 2009 Interrogatories, \nregarding the extent of his marijuana use between December 2001 and January 2002. \nThe Government contended that his omissions may raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally falsified two answers about the frequency \nof his marijuana usage during said time. When a falsification allegation is controverted \nor denied, the Government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission \noccurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJun. 9, 2004)). \nApplicant disclosed in the November 2006 e-QIP that he used marijuana twice \nbetween December 2001 and January 2002. During a December 2008 interview, he \nindicated that he used it more than twice. The investigator recorded Applicant\u2019s usage \nas being about 15 times. Applicant also disclosed during the interview that he used it \n\n \n \n \n \n8\ntwice in 1969. In the May 2009 Interrogatories, Applicant stated again that he used it \ntwice between December 2001 and January 2002. He disclosed that he used it daily \nbetween October and November 1970. In July 2009, he had an opportunity to review \nthe accuracy of the summary of the December 2008 interview. He noted that he could \nnot accurately recall the specifics of either time because he used it casually for social \npurposes. In his October 2009 Answer, he reiterated that he did not have a specific \nrecollection of the number of times he used it between December 2001 and January \n2002. During his February 2010 testimony, he denied telling the investigator that he \nused it 15 times during that time frame, but could not recall the number of times he did \nuse it.  \n \nAlthough the full extent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana usage is unclear, it is apparent \nthat he smoked marijuana more than twice between December 2001 and January 2002. \nHis testimony that he cannot recall or that he only used it twice is not credible. In May \n2009, he specifically recalled daily use between October and November 1970, some \nforty years ago, but in July 2009, he could not recall his usage from seven years prior. \nInstead of acknowledging that he used marijuana more than twice, as he told the \ninvestigator in December 2008, he equivocated during the hearing and attempted to \nminimize his usage. While the number of times he smoked marijuana for one month \nseven or eight years ago would not normally be a great security concern at this time, his \nlack of candor about the incident raises a significant concern about his trustworthiness \nand reliability. Hence, the evidence establishes deliberate falsification.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant did not initiate any effort to correct his omission of information until \nconfronted by an investigator in December 2008. There is no evidence that Applicant \nreceived inadequate advice or instruction during the clearance process about the \nnecessity for full disclosure. He continues to deny that he intentionally concealed \ninformation throughout this investigation, to such an extent that the offense is not minor \nand does cast doubt about his reliability and trustworthiness. He has not acknowledged \nhis omissions or taken other steps to assure the Government that similar behavior is \nunlikely to recur or that his susceptibility to exploitation has diminished as a result of his \nprevious conduct and current lack of candor. None of the above four mitigating \nconditions apply.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 59-year-old educated man \nand father of nine children. As a consequence of a divorce from his second wife, a two-\nyear period of unemployment, and financial obligations for a large family, he has \nexperienced significant financial obligations and difficulties for the past seven years. \nWhile he is unable to pay $7,800 of debt alleged in the SOR, he is resolving the \n$20,000 debt owed to the IRS and has successfully disputed $2,280. According to his \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nbudget, he carefully manages his finances and acknowledges his obligations. He \ncalculated that there may now be money in his budget for small monthly payments to \nthe six unpaid creditors listed in the SOR. His delinquent debts no longer pose a \nsecurity concern. However, his equivocating about the extent of his marijuana use \nseven years ago does raise a personal conduct concern. After disclosing in December \n2008 that he intended to be truthful about his past marijuana usage, which occurred \nmore than the two times which he disclosed in the e-QIP, he subsequently decided that \nhe could not specifically recall the number of times or asserted that it was no more than \ntwice. Unfortunately, that lack of forthright disclosure is precisely the type of conduct \nthat raises a potential risk which the Government cannot assume. If Applicant cannot be \nfully candid about incidents in his past, he may not be truthful about future conduct, \nespecially as it may relate to his access or handling of classified information.     \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Edmunds, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an undated \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant received the SOR on June 10, 2010. He answered the SOR on June \n22, 2010, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on July 12, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 28, 2010, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on August 18, 2010. The Government \nSeptember 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant \ntestified, called three witnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through M, which were \nadmitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant submitted a letter that was marked AE N and admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 26, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2007. He served in the U.S. Air Force and received an \nHonorable Discharge. He seeks to retain a security clearance that he has held for more \nthan 20 years without incident. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. He \nhas been married for more than ten years. He has no children.1 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is $23,053 past-due on a mortgage that has a \nbalance of $99,433. It also alleges that Applicant and his wife owe approximately \n$102,557 in unsecured credit card debt. Applicant admitted the past-due mortgage \nallegation, and he denied the unsecured credit card debt allegation. He also provided \ninformation in support of his request for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant started investing in real estate in about 2000. Over the next several \nyears, in addition to his home, he purchased five investment properties. He is handy \nand was able to do some of the renovations of the properties himself. Two of the \nproperties were adjacent with several acres of land. Applicant hoped to develop the \nadjacent properties into a single property with a commercial application. He worked with \na developer who was also a manager of the type of commercial property that Applicant \nsought to develop. Applicant met with the zoning commission on numerous occasions \nand also had out-of-pocket expenses for the planning of the project. The developer \ndropped out of the project in 2008. Applicant has put on hold, if not cancelled, any plans \nto develop the two properties.2 \n \n \nApplicant funded the purchase of his properties and their renovations through \nvarious means. All the investment properties were essentially 100% financed through \nfirst and second mortgages. His credit card balances increased substantially as he was \nrenovating the properties. Applicant worked for a defense contactor from 1996 until he \nwas laid off in 2007 after his employer lost a contract. He was out of work for about two \nto three months before he started working for his current employer. He took out a loan \nagainst his 401(k) at his former job. When he was laid off, he took a distribution of about \n$75,000 from the 401(k). That distribution created a tax liability that he has since \nresolved.3 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 40, 43, 78-79; GE 1; AE K. \n \n2 Tr. at 39, 50, 58-60; GE 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 43, 51, 74-76; GE 2.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant took out a second mortgage of $100,000 on one of \nthe properties. He used the funds he received from the second mortgage and the 401(k) \ndistribution to renovate the properties and for living expenses while he was \nunemployed.4  \n \n \nApplicant had periods when he did not have tenants in his properties. His wife\u2019s \nparents rented one of the properties, but they both passed away. He and his wife \nprovided financial support to her parents. His wife also did not work while she was \ncaring for her mother.5 \n \n \nApplicant had a difficult time paying all the mortgages and his credit card debt. \nWhen he saw that he was not going to be able to pay all his debts on time, he notified \nhis supervisor so that the information could be forwarded to the Department of Defense. \nSeveral credit card accounts became delinquent in about 2007, and Applicant stopped \npaying the second mortgage he obtained in 2006. Applicant hoped he could sell one or \nmore of his properties to satisfy his debts. Around the same time period, the housing \nmarket collapsed, which made it difficult to sell the properties for what was owed on the \nmortgages.6  \n \n \nApplicant sold two of his investment properties. He settled at least two debts. He \nhas brought current all his other credit card debt. In 2009, he reported in his response to \ninterrogatories that he and his wife had ten credit card accounts with balances totaling \n$102,557. That figure did not include the settled accounts. He reported at the hearing \nthat the balances on the ten accounts were $86,126. He submitted account statements \nfrom the ten accounts. The balances from the account statements were slightly lower \nthan reported by Applicant. One of the accounts was several months past-due before \nApplicant brought it current within the last month.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve the delinquent second mortgage was hindered when \nthe bank that owned the mortgage went bankrupt. He and the bank that purchased the \nsecond mortgage agreed to settle the $99,433 owed on the second mortgage for \n$25,000. Applicant borrowed $25,000 from his 401(k) and paid the settlement on the \nsecond mortgage in August 2010. He is aware that the settlement could have tax \nconsequences, and he is preparing for that possibility.8 \n \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling from multiple sources. He completed \nformal financial counseling on August 7, 2010. Applicant believes he has weathered his \nfinancial difficulties. He completed a net worth statement worksheet. He estimates the \nvalue of his and his wife\u2019s assets at almost $1.6 million and his liabilities at about $1.15 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 44-46. \n \n5 Tr. at 40, 60-61, 85; GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 45, 56-57, 73; GE 2; AE A. \n \n7 Tr. at 36, 41, 46, 53, 70-72; GE -5; AE M. \n \n8 Tr. at 34-36, 47, 50, 63, 80-81; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE H, N. \n\n \n4 \n \nmillion, leaving an estimated net worth of more than $435,000. His assets include his \nhouse and six additional properties. Three of the properties are undeveloped land, with \nno mortgages. The estimated value of the three properties totals $180,000. Two of the \nproperties were inherited by his wife. Applicant and his wife own a 9-year-old vehicle \nand two 15-year-old vehicles. He has renters in his three investment houses. He has \nabout $6,200 in his bank account and $25,000 remaining in his 401(k) after his $25,000 \nloan. He has a positive cash flow after his monthly income and liabilities are calculated. \nHe still hopes to sell at least one of the investment properties. He is convinced that he \nhas sufficient assets to deal with any additional contingencies such as the loss of a \ntenant.9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s witnesses and character letters attested to his superior job \nperformance, integrity, honor, dependability, dedication, leadership, judgment, ethics, \ntrustworthiness, professionalism, reliability, and honesty. The character references \nrecommend him for a security clearance.10  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 37-42, 49-54, 63-66, 77-78, 83-86; GE 2-5; AE I, J, L. \n \n10 Tr. at 15-33; AE A-G. I give little weight to the references\u2019 recommendations about Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness.  \n\n \n5 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \n \n \nApplicant purchased more properties than he had the financial resources to \nmanage. He used credit cards to partially fund the renovations of the properties. At one \n\n \n6 \n \npoint, he and his wife owed more than $100,000 in unsecured credit card debt. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise all the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant only recently resolved his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not yet \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were mainly related to his real estate investments. \nHis investments did not go as planned. A partner in a development dropped out; he had \nproperties without renters for a period; he was unemployed for several months; and the \nhousing market collapsed. Some of these factors were outside his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. All investments carry risk, some more so than others. Applicant \nessentially was leveraging his investments when he completely financed his properties. \nHousing markets have soared in the past and collapsed, and they will likely do so again. \nBecause of the inherent risk in Applicant\u2019s investment strategy, I am unable to make a \ndetermination that he acted completely responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling. He has sold two properties and has \nrenters in his other properties. He settled or brought current all his debts, including his \nIRS debt. He has a positive cash flow and assets that can be used in the event of any \nadditional contingencies. His financial situation is far from perfect because he still has a \nlarge amount of debt. However, he has sufficiently managed his finances to convince \nme that there are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved and \nare under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. Applicant does not receive full mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) because his mortgage debt was settled after the issuance of the SOR \nfor one quarter of the amount he owed.  \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. Applicant overextended \nhimself when he purchased more properties than he was able to manage. His \nunsecured debt soared and he was unable to pay the second mortgage on one of the \nproperties. He settled that debt and brought all his other debts current. He sold two of \nhis properties and has renters in his other properties. He has a positive cash flow and \nsufficient assets to address future contingencies. His finances do not constitute a \nsecurity risk. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old subcontract manager, who has been employed by a defense contractor for about 35 years. He served a three-year enlistment in the Marine Corps, and was honorably discharged in 1978. He has held a security clearance since 1984. He has been divorced since 1995, and has three adult children. (AR at 3; GE 4 at 6, 11-14, 17-18, 21, 27-28; Tr. at 8-9, 36-40.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the truth of all factual allegations set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, with explanations. (AR at 1-5.) Those admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact. Applicant began gambling in 1996 after his divorce and a break-up with a subsequent girlfriend. The first year he lost around $16,000. He was unable to pay all of his bills, and tried unsuccessfully to sell his house. In March 1997 he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief, listing four unsecured creditor accounts totaling $42,650. Two of these debts, totaling $28,000 were exempted from discharge, and Applicant made regular monthly payments to those creditors after his July 1997 discharge until they were satisfied. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. at 42-44, 79-80.) Applicant attended about eight months of professional counseling for his depression and gambling problem in 1997. He also attended Gamblers Anonymous (GA) for the first time that year. In February 1998, he told a Defense Investigative Service agent: I don\u2019t think I have any problems with gambling now. I may go to a casino once ",

On\nJuly 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nFebruary 17, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 3, 2009. He answered the SOR\nin writing (AR) on August 10, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 17, 2009, and\nDOHA assigned the case to me on September 24, 2009.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 1, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on October 28, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which was also admitted without\nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until November 15,\n2009, for submission of additional evidence. Applicant timely submitted documentation\nthat he resolved two debts (AE B), an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Installment\nAgreement (AE C), and his annual performance evaluations for the last five years (AE\nD), which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on November 5, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old subcontract manager, who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor for about 35 years. He served a three-year enlistment in the Marine\nCorps, and was honorably discharged in 1978. He has held a security clearance since\n1984. He has been divorced since 1995, and has three adult children. (AR at 3; GE 4 at\n6, 11-14, 17-18, 21, 27-28; Tr. at 8-9, 36-40.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted the truth of all factual allegations set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g, with\nexplanations. (AR at 1-5.) Those admissions are incorporated into the following findings\nof fact.\nApplicant began gambling in 1996 after his divorce and a break-up with a\nsubsequent girlfriend. The first year he lost around $16,000. He was unable to pay all of\nhis bills, and tried unsuccessfully to sell his house. In March 1997 he filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief, listing four unsecured creditor accounts totaling $42,650. Two of these\ndebts, totaling $28,000 were exempted from discharge, and Applicant made regular\nmonthly payments to those creditors after his July 1997 discharge until they were\nsatisfied. (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. at 42-44, 79-80.)\n Applicant attended about eight months of professional counseling for his\ndepression and gambling problem in 1997. He also attended Gamblers Anonymous\n(GA) for the first time that year. In February 1998, he told a Defense Investigative\nService agent:\nI don\u2019t think I have any problems with gambling now. I may go to a casino\nonce or twice a month to play blackjack, but I set a limit now. I know it\nprobably isn\u2019t the right thing to do, but since I set a limit of $50 & stick with\nit, I don\u2019t think it will cause me any problems.\n\n3\n(GE 3 at 3.) Applicant\u2019s gambling problems continued, however. He attended GA\nmeetings for about ten months during 2001-2002, for about six months in 2003, for\nabout ten months in 2004 (along with another six months of mental health counseling as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g), for about four months in 2007, and for about two months in 2008.\nAccording to Applicant:\nThere were times after I exited the program during those years I would\nabstain from gambling. But, that didn\u2019t last very long. So, the times that I\nwas not gambling is when I was in the program.\n(Tr. at 44-45.) He was interviewed in January 2008 by an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM), and estimated that he spent from $400 to $500 per\ngambling outing, totaling about $25,000 annually. He also told the investigator that he\nrealized he had a gambling problem when not attending GA meetings, and that he was\nagain attending them. (GE 7 at 6.)\nApplicant last gambled in January 2009. Late in that month, he began a series of\nhospitalizations for surgeries, heart attacks, and other medical complications. He was in\nthe hospital from late January to March, in June, and again in September 2009. In April\n2009, he resumed attendance and participation in several different GA meeting groups.\nPeople with whom he has attended GA since 2001 or 2002 testified that his recent\nparticipation is far more committed, enthusiastic, and sincere than it had been during\nearlier periods of attendance. His stated intention is to continue abstinence from\ngambling and active participation in GA to help him prevent another relapse. (AE A at 5;\nTr. at 29-33, 57-74.) His mother, with whom he now resides, also testified to his\ntransformation since January 2009, his rededication to family relationships without\ninterference from gambling, and his lifelong patriotism. (Tr. at 74-79.)\nApplicant failed to pay a substantial portion of his Federal income taxes each\nyear from 2001 through 2008. He has not yet filed or calculated his 2009 income tax\nobligation, but hopes that his recently renewed contributions into his 401(k) savings\naccount will reduce the amount he owes by enough to be covered by his withholdings,\nunlike the previous years. His Federal income tax delinquencies total approximately\n$55,000 for tax years 2003 through 2008.Two tax liens were filed against him for\nportions of this total as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. He has negotiated several\ndifferent agreements with the IRS to pay his delinquent taxes, and has satisfied the\ndelinquencies for 2001 and 2002. In November 2007, his agreement called for $1,500\nmonthly payments. By April of 2009, that amount had changed to $1,024 per month. In\nOctober 2009, Applicant began paying $1,100 per month under another revised\ninstallment agreement, with the intent to have all back taxes paid within five years. (AR\nat 4, 5; GE 7 at 6, 14; AE C; Tr. at 50-54, 80-83, 86.)\nApplicant\u2019s annual income is about $101,000. Since he now lives with his\nparents, he has reduced his living expenses to the point that he has more than $2,000\nper month in surplus income after paying his IRS installment agreement and remaining\nnon-delinquent debt payments. Since January 2009, he has used that surplus to reduce\n\n4\nhis outstanding debt from 25 creditors to 8, including the IRS. He satisfied the two non-\nIRS delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, by making final payments toward\nboth in early October 2009. His total debt to the seven non-IRS creditors was $21,220\nas of October 16, 2009, and he was current on the scheduled monthly payments for\neach of them. He was also able to increase the value of his 401(k) savings account from\n$31,574 to $46,662 between April and October 2009. (GE 8; GE 10; AE A; AE B; Tr. at\n47-49, 54-57, 83-86.)   \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2004 through 2008 reflect that he\ngenerally exceeded expectations and performed his responsible duties in an efficient\nand effective manner. (AE D.) His testimony and demeanor during the hearing reflected\ncandor and sincerity in his desire and intent to avoid future financial problems, and\nespecially not to resume gambling. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider and apply the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded in mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides, \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n\n5\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel requested analysis of the applicability of four of\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt;\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling\nproblems, or other issues of security concern. \n(Tr. at 18.) Applicant began gambling to an extent that he could not meet his other\nfinancial obligations in 1996. Even with six different periods of abstinence during GA\nparticipation between 1997 and 2008, this problem continued into January 2009. During\nthose years, he was regularly unable or unwilling to satisfy numerous debts, specifically\n\n6\nincluding his Federal income tax liabilities starting in 2001. Since undergoing a series of\nserious medical problems in 2009, he stopped gambling and has resolved a number of\ndelinquent debts. However, about $55,000 in Federal tax delinquencies remain, which\nwill take five years to repay under current arrangements. Applicant\u2019s present financial\ninability to pay these substantial remaining delinquencies supports ongoing security\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). He is under continuing financial duress, so he remains at\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The evidence further\nestablished a lengthy and ongoing history of not meeting significant financial obligations\nas a result of his addictive gambling problems, raising security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(c) and (f). This history raises concerns about poor self-control, lack of judgment, and\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising questions about his\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. AG \u00b6 19(b) was\nnot established in this case. Although Applicant admits irresponsible spending over the\nperiod from 1996 to 2008 that resulted in multiple delinquent debts, his resolution of\nmany of these debts between April and October 2009, and his recent arrangement\nregarding the remaining IRS debt, provide some evidence of willingness and intent to\npay his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from\nthe foregoing financial considerations. Potentially applicable mitigating conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nAG \u00b6 20(a) was not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose over\nthe last fourteen years, and the substantial Federal tax debts continue at present. His\nmultiple relapses into gambling after previous attempts at abstinence with the\n\n7\nassistance of mental health counselors and the GA program also preclude application of\nthis mitigating condition without a longer period of successful reform. Applicant\u2019s 1995\ndivorce partially contributed to the debt problems underlying his 1997 bankruptcy, but\nhis gambling was the primary cause. He lost $16,000 gambling during the year\npreceding the court\u2019s discharge of about $14,000 in unsecured debt. He also had\nsignificant medical problems in 2009, but those issues had no causal relationship to any\nSOR-alleged financial concerns. Accordingly, mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) was not\nestablished. Applicant resumed participation in the GA program during the six months\npreceding his hearing, and several fellow GA members observed that he seems more\ndedicated and sincere now than he was during his six previous unsuccessful attempts.\nThis is a very good start, but given his history of relapse, it is too soon to reach a finding\nthat there are clear indications that the problem is under control. Applicant repaid two\nsmaller delinquencies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d immediately before his hearing.\nHowever, he pays only $1,100 per month toward his large Federal tax debt, despite a\nmonthly surplus income of more than $2,000. Thus, meaningful mitigation is not yet\nestablished under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or (d). Applicant did not dispute any of his delinquencies\nunder AG \u00b6 20(e), and in fact admitted that they were valid debts. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of\nsecurity concern was fourteen years of failure to meet financial obligations, including\nsignificant Federal tax debt resulting from years of excessive gambling. He resolved a\nnumber of debts during 2009, while again participating in GA and abstaining from\ngambling. Unfortunately, each of six previous attempts to control his gambling addiction\nthrough GA participation ended in relapses and further financial irresponsibility. Two\ncourses of counseling by mental health providers similarly failed. His pattern of not\n\n8\npaying his Federal tax obligations for many successive years, together with the absence\nof any meaningful effort to avoid recurrence of the problem for 2009, raise particular\nconcerns about his commitment to fulfilling his Federal duties and obligations. His\nactions during 2009 demonstrate a good start toward controlling gambling and paying\ncreditors, but are not yet of sufficient duration to eliminate these security concerns.\nApplicant has not yet established a good-faith track record of financial responsibility or\npermanent behavioral changes. The record demonstrates his unwillingness to more\npromptly address his delinquent Federal debt despite substantial surplus income.\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing indebtedness generates continuing potential for pressure, coercion,\nor duress. His 1997 bankruptcy was so far in the past that, in itself, it would not support\nsecurity concerns. However, it represents the beginning of a long and continuing pattern\nof financial irresponsibility relating to problem gambling and supports continuing\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability. Insufficient time has passed\nto demonstrate that his gambling-related financial problems are unlikely to recur or\nworsen. \nApplicant did not mitigate security concerns arising from his history of failing to\nmeet financial obligations, and his inability to pay his gambling-related delinquent debts.\nThe record generates significant doubt as to his present eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. She is married, but she separated from her husband in \nSeptember 2007. She has a 17-year-old son who is in high school. She has attended \ncollege and needs six more classes to complete her bachelor\u2019s degree. She attended \ncollege full-time until September 2003.

After several \nyears of this pattern, she learned sometime in 2007 that her husband was not \ndepositing his wages in their account and he was instead using the money to buy illegal \ndrugs. After a domestic violence incident, the court became involved and garnished her \nhusband\u2019s wages in October 2008, so Applicant would receive support before he spent \nhis money on drugs. She received $1,200 a month for support. He lost his job in April or \nMay 2008, and did not pay support until February 2010, when he began paying $500 a \nmonth. She did not receive support from March or April 2008 until February 2010. The \ncurrent support she receives is not court-ordered. She stated when she was living with \nher husband they would concentrate on paying his debts. He was the family\u2019s primary \nsource of income and she was a full-time student and stay-at-home parent.3 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.a ($74) was a checking account that was closed in October \n2005. Applicant was to make four payments of $68 beginning in November 2006. She \nmade three payments and did not make the fourth, and it went to collection in January \n \n1 Department Counsel\u2019s Memorandum was marked Hearing Exhibit I. \n \n2 Tr. 30-37, 43-44, 83. \n \n3 Tr. 37-44, 83-86. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nin a default status.   \n                                                          \n2009. She paid the balance owed in August 2009. Applicant stated her failure to make \nthe last payment was an oversight. This is the same debt as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.4 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,418) was reported delinquent in 2003. Applicant \nstated in her answer to the SOR that she began to take action on the debt in November \n2006. She agreed to make ten payments of $25. She missed a payment and the \ncollection company then wanted six lump sum payments, which she could not afford. \nThe debt was sold to a collection firm who filed a claim in court. After to the claim, the \nfirm dissolved and Applicant was waiting to hear the status of the court date. She made \nher last payment on the debt sometime in 2007. On March 22, 2010, the court case was \ndismissed. There is no further court action on this debt, and it is presumed to be \nresolved.5 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($24,000) is for a student loan. Applicant attended college \nfrom 1995 until 2003. She financed her education through student loans. Each semester \nshe would get another student loan. Her total student loan debt is approximately \n$79,313.6 She consolidated her student loans. She made two payments of $480.77 in \nJanuary and February 2010. She has an agreement with the student loan creditor to \npay $180 a month, which began in March 2010, and will continue until December 2010, \nand then her finances will be reevaluated to determine if the payments should be \nchanged. She also stated some of her student loans are deferred until December \n2010.7 Applicant provided a document from a student loan creditor stating her \nforbearance request was processed. One of her loans was granted a forbearance from \nApril 2010 to May 2010, due to temporary hardship.8 It appears Applicant has \nrehabilitated some of her student loans and is making payments, and some are deferred \nand are no longer \n9\n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.e ($1,033) was forwarded for collection in October 2006. \nApplicant made arrangements to pay $25 a month.10 She was presented with a \nsettlement offer in June 2009 to pay $516.94 to settle the debt. She stated she made \none or two payments of $172 and then could not pay the remaining amount. She now \nhas a new agreement with the creditor and she will make eight monthly payments of \n \n4 Tr. 87-88, 94. \n \n5 AE G; Tr. 79-80, 88-94. \n \n6 GE 2; AE J page 2. \n \n7 There appear to be three student loan debts.

She provided documentation that showed she paid $114.67 in February, April, \nMay, and June 2010.11 Appellant is resolving this debt.  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b61.f ($100) is a medical debt. Applicant incurred the debt in \n2007, and it went to collection in 2008. She was unaware she owed the debt, and when \nshe became aware, she paid it in February 2010. She provided a document showing \n$100 was transferred to the creditor.12 \n \n \nApplicant earns approximately $55,000 a year. She has submitted applications \nfor a second job. The debts listed in the SOR are in her name only. Applicant attributes \nher financial problems to when her husband stopped paying her child support and would \nspend the family income on drugs before they separated. Applicant now has control \nover her personal finances. She is paying her current bills on time and living within her \nmeans. She anticipated a pay raise in July 2010.13 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified on her behalf. She has worked for him for \nabout a year-and-a-half. He is a graduate of a service academy. He considers Applicant \ndependable, honest, and he relies on her to provide him accurate and reliable \ninformation, both positive and negative. She is forthright in relaying critical information to \nhim. This is an important aspect of her job and he depends on it to complete his job. \nShe has a good reputation in the company. She supervises between 8 and 12 people. \nHe has no concerns about granting her a security clearance.14  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n11 Tr. 94-106; Answer to SOR; AE H. \n \n12 Tr. 106-107; Answer to SOR. \n \n13 Tr. 80-82, 134-135. \n \n14 Tr. 18-29. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts that were unpaid and unresolved for a period of \ntime. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant was unaware of one of her delinquent debts. When she became aware \nshe paid it. She had difficulty paying her debts and student loans when her husband \nstopped working two jobs and squandered their money on drugs. He stopped paying \nchild support and for a period of time caused additional financial problems for her. \nThese conditions were beyond her control. Her largest debt is her student loans. She \nconsolidated and rehabilitated them and they are no longer in default status. One debt \nwas being resolved in a court action that has since been dismissed, and it does not \nappear there is further action on the debt. Applicant is making payments on a payment \nplan and has paid or resolved the remaining debts. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) \napplies. The circumstances of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are unlikely to recur. She is \nno longer reliant on her husband\u2019s income and is paying her owns bills. I find AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies because the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond her control and she has acted responsibly under the circumstances in resolving \nthem. She has her student loan debt and repayment plan under control and has paid or \nis in a payment plan resolving her remaining debts. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c) and 20 (d) \n\n \n7 \n \n \napply. Applicant was involved in a lawsuit regarding one of her debts because the \ncreditor went out of business. The suit has been dismissed, and it does not appear the \ndebt is being pursued. I find AG 20 \u00b6 (e) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant experienced financial \ndifficulty when her husband stopped working his second job and began squandering his \nmoney on drugs. Applicant has paid, resolved, or is paying all of her debts. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had served in the U.S. military from 1983 until 2005 and had\nheld a security clearance since 1984.  She has five delinquent debts, totaling approximately $12,800.\nThey became delinquent between 2002 and 2005.  Additionally, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nquestion on the security clearance application (SCA) inquiring whether she had debts more than 180\ndays delinquent.  This answer was not correct.  The Judge concluded that these facts establish\ndisqualifying conditions under the Directive.  \nIn analyzing Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation, he concluded that her military experience and\nhistory of holding a security clearance militated against an innocent mistake in providing the false\nanswer to the SCA.  Regarding the debts, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s having failed to respond\nto the file of relevant material resulted in numerous unanswered questions about her\nfinances\u2013questions about the reasons for her delinquent debts, her plans to pay them off, etc.   As\n1\na consequence, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not met her burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation.

Two of the past due debts (SOR 1.b. and 1.c.) are delinquent telephone\naccounts. SOR 1.e. is a credit card. The accounts became delinquent between 2002\nand 2005. Even though given the opportunity to explain the origin of the accounts, why\nthey became delinquent, and a plan to address them, Applicant provided no information.\nPersonal Conduct\nAs set forth in subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR, Applicant executed a security\nclearance questionnaire (SCA) on October 3, 2008. In response to question 28.a. (In\nthe last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?), Applicant\nchecked \u201cno,\u201d giving the impression she had no debts over six months delinquent. I find\n\n3\nApplicant intentionally omitted her delinquent financial accounts from her SCA in\nOctober 2008. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no statements or independent evidence regarding her job\nperformance and/or reputation in the community where she lives. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the variables listed in the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s five accounts, more than 180 days delinquent, total approximately\n$12,800. The debts have been delinquent for four to seven years. FC disqualifying\ncondition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b6 19.c. (a\nhistory not meeting financial obligations) apply. The existence of the debts denotes an\ninability to pay them. Given Applicant\u2019s understanding of the importance of the security\ninvestigation, Applicant\u2019s decision not to provide any evidence as to how she plans to\nresolve the debts suggests an unwillingness to pay the debts she created. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances); FC MC \u00b6 20.c. (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control); FC MC \u00b6 20.d. (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts); and\nFC MC \u00b6 20.e. (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue). None of the mitigators are applicable. \nFC MC \u00b6 20.a. is inapplicable. Even though the debts are dated, the fact that\nthey have not been paid continues to cast a pall over Applicant\u2019s judgment and\nreliability. FC MC \u00b6 20.b. cannot supply mitigation as there is no indication the debts\nwere caused by unforeseen circumstances. Applicant has been steadily employed since\nher Honorable Discharge from the service in 2005. There is no evidence of medical\nproblems. Finally, she furnished no evidence connecting her financial problems to her\ndivorce in 1991. \nFC MC \u00b6 20.c. does not apply as there is no evidence that shows Applicant has\nreceived financial counseling. With no evidence of how Applicant intends to remedy her\n\n5\nfinancial indebtedness, there is no basis upon which to conclude her financial difficulties\nare being resolved. With no restitution payments, Applicant cannot satisfy FC MC \u00b6\n20.d. \nIn her original and amended answers to the SOR, Applicant disputed the debt\nlisted in subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR. When disputing a debt, FC MC \u00b6 20.e. requires\nan applicant to (1) furnish a reasonable explanation for the dispute and (2) provide\ndocumented proof that corroborates her explanation. Applicant has not complied with\nthe two elements of the mitigator, rendering FC MC \u00b6 20.e. inapplicable. The FC\nguideline is resolved against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b6 15. The Concern. \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThis guideline applies to intentional attempts to conceal or omit information from\nan SCA. I am unable to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under this guideline because she\ndeliberately omitted all her delinquent debt from her SCA. PC DC \u00b6 16.a. (deliberate\nomission or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness) applies.\nThere are three mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances in this case. Those conditions are: PC MC \u00b6 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment or falsification, before\nbeing confronted with the facts); PC MC \u00b6 17.c. (the offense was so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and, PC MC \u00b6 17.d. (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur). PC MC \u00b6 17.a. is not applicable as Applicant did not acknowledge her\ndelinquent debt history until after she received the SOR in March or early April 2009. PC\nMC \u00b6 17.c. is inapplicable because Applicant tried to conceal her entire debt history by\nmisrepresenting to the government she had no overdue debts. Applicant\u2019s intentional\nomission of material financial information in October 2008 continues to cast doubt on\nher reliability and judgment. Lastly, Applicant receives no mitigation under PC MC \u00b6\n17.d. because she still maintains her intentional omission was the result of negligence.\nThe PC guideline is resolved against Applicant.  \n\n6\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence utilizing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nof the FC and PC guidelines. Even though I have resolved both guidelines against\nApplicant, the case still must be weighed within the context of nine variables known as\nthe whole person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was 20 years old when she joined the military. During her 21 years in\nthe service, Applicant became certified as a career information counselor, a drug and\nalcohol facilitator, an employment requirements manager, and a scheduling and cost\ncontrol analyst. Even without character evidence, it is clear she used her time wisely. By\nhaving a security clearance since 1984, it is fair to assume she had to fill out security\nforms more than once over a 20-year period. With her security clearance background, I\nam unable to accept her claim that she misread the financial question. The absence of\nevidence to demonstrate how she is going to pay back her creditors, coupled with her\ndeliberate omission on an official government document, damages her credibility and\nindicates her current financial problems are likely to persist in the future. Even if she has\ndetermined that she does not have to pay the debts because they are legally\nunenforceable under the state statute of limitations, this action cannot be interpreted as\nthe same type of good-faith effort to resolve debts as a documented track record\nshowing regular payments of past due debts. See, FC MC \u00b6 20.c. The FC and PC\nguidelines are resolved against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on October 1, 2008. On June 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 9, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 21, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 24, 2009. On August 3, 2009, a Notice of Hearing \nwas issued, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2009. The case was heard on that \ndate. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered no exhibits. The record was \nheld open until September 8, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nHe timely submitted a 4-page document that was admitted as AE A. Department \nCounsel\u2019s response to AE A is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was \nreceived on September 10, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a \u2013 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, \n1.s, 1.v, and 1.w. He denies SOR allegations 1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t, and 1.u.   \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old independent contractor with a Department of Defense \ncontractor applying for a security clearance. He has worked as an independent \ncontractor for the Department of Defense contractor since March 2008. This is his first \ntime applying for a security clearance. He is a high school graduate and has taken \nsome college courses. He is divorced and has two sons, ages 17 and 3. (Tr at 5-6, 17; \nGov 1.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has the \nfollowing delinquent accounts: a $238 utility account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a: \nGov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 7); a $2,158 judgment entered against Applicant in April 2007 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 3); a $2,448 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 11; a $1,827 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 10); a $975 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 5); a $264 auto account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 6, 14); a $2,928 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 4, 13); a $4,520 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9); a $2,989 credit card account placed for collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 9, 14); and $9,537 in delinquent child support owed to \nState A (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 10). \n \nAdditional delinquent accounts include: a $131 tax lien filed in March 1994 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.k: Gov 4 at 3); a $543 credit card account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 4 at \n4, 13); a $731 telephone account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 4 at 4) a $233 \ntelephone account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 4 at 4); a $2,653 credit card \naccount that was charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 4 at 6); a $279 cable television account \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.p: Gov 4 at 6); a $573 fitness club account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.q: Gov 4 at 8); a $222 charged off account (SOR \u00b6 1.r: Gov 4 at 8); \na $2,799 account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.s: Gov 4 at 12); $10,613 in delinquent \nchild support owed to State B (SOR \u00b6 1.t: Gov 4 at 13); and a $5,200 credit card \naccount placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.u: Gov 4 at 13).  \n \nThe investigation also discovered that in October 2005, Applicant was charged \nwith Fraud-Insufficient Funds Check. The charge was disposed through pre-trial \ndiversion. (Gov 5) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant consulted a credit counseling agency about two months prior to the \nhearing. He is considering filing for bankruptcy. He has not paid any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR because he could not afford to pay the debts. He claims some of the debts \nare duplicates but provided no proof that any of the debts were duplicate accounts. (Tr \nat 18 \u2013 20)  Applicant is listed as an authorized user on the $5,200 credit card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.u. This allegation is found for Applicant because he is not the \naccount holder. (Gov 4 at 13)    \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant\u2019s divorce was final. He claims most of the debts \nwere incurred during events leading up to and after his divorce. He was held \nresponsible for all of the credit card accounts even though most of the accounts \nbelonged to his ex-wife. His ex-wife filed for bankruptcy shortly after the divorce. (Tr at \n17, 20)  \n \nApplicant had several periods of unemployment within the past five years. In \n2002, he was unemployed for approximately five months until he was hired by a \npublishing company in January 2003. In March 2005, he was asked by the publishing \ncompany to resign. Applicant testified that he was asked to resign because one of his \nwife\u2019s friends worked at the company and spread numerous rumors about Applicant\u2019s \nmarital problems which created morale problems in the workplace. After he resigned, \nApplicant was unemployed for one year. He did not file for unemployment during this \ntime. Before resigning, he received a $16,000 bonus which he used for living expenses. \nHe also worked periodic construction jobs.  His e-QIP application indicates he operated \nhis own construction business during that time. (Tr at 33-38; Gov 1, section 11)  \n \nThe two accounts for past due child support, $9,537 for State A (SOR \u00b6 1.j) and \n$10,613 for State B (SOR \u00b6 1.t), involve Applicant\u2019s oldest son, age 17. When his oldest \nson was one-year-old, his mother moved from State A to State B without informing \nApplicant. He has not seen his son for 16 years. Applicant has always paid child support \nto State A. He admits that he owes approximately $10,613 in past due child support to \nState A. He has been making child support payments to State A which include \npayments towards the arrearage for several years. (Tr at 25-28, 50) There is some \nconfusion between State A and State B as to which state should be collecting child \nsupport. Apparently the child has lived in both states at some point. State A and State B \nare in the process of resolving this issue. (AE A at 3)    \n \nIt was discovered during the hearing that Applicant owes back taxes to the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 2001 and 2002. The balance is \napproximately $25,000. The last time he paid towards the tax debt was two years ago. \nHe has not contacted the IRS recently. (Tr at 44-46) This tax debt is not alleged in the \nSOR.   However, SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges that a tax lien was filed against Applicant in March \n1994.   \n \nA personal financial worksheet completed by Applicant on April 27, 2009, listed a \nnet monthly income of $1,600. His monthly expenses were: rent $650, groceries $100, \nutilities $100, car expenses $360, and child support $425. His total monthly expenses \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwere $1,635. (Gov 2 at 5) Applicant\u2019s net monthly income recently increased to $4,000. \nHis rent increased to $1,000. His total monthly expenses are currently $1,900. He \nrecently received the raise and did not have time to pay any of his debts. He hopes to \napply an extra $500 to $700 a month towards his debts. (Tr at 18, 22-23)  \n \nApplicant claims he disputed some accounts but has not heard anything from the \ncredit reporting agencies. He is in the process of trying to put his life back together. (Tr \nat 53-54)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n5 \n \n \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has had financial difficulties for \nseveral years. The SOR alleged 21 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance \nof $51,861. It was also discovered during the hearing that Applicant owed $25,000 to \nthe IRS for tax years 2001 and 2002.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has had financial problems for several years. Most of the delinquent accounts \nremain unresolved. While Applicant looked into the options of credit counseling or filing \nfor bankruptcy, he had no definitive plan to resolve his delinquent accounts at the close \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof the record. Applicant\u2019s unresolved debts raise questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies because of Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce and two periods of unemployment in 2002 and 2005. However, I cannot \nconclude Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances because he has ignored \nhis delinquent debts during periods where he has been employed full-time. The $25,000 \nfederal income tax debt was created in tax years 2001 and 2002 before his periods of \nunemployment. Applicant has been financially irresponsible for a number of years. \nWhile circumstances beyond his control contributed to his financial problems, he has \nnot acted responsibly with regards to resolving his delinquent accounts.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant consulted a credit counseling agency two months \nbefore his hearing but did not establish a payment plan. It is unlikely Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems will be resolved in the near future because he does not have a plan \nestablished as to how he was going to resolve his financial problems. \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. Applicant is in the process of \ndeciding what action to take in order to resolve his delinquent accounts. He made no \npayments towards any of his delinquent accounts by the close of the record. He has not \nmade a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply. Applicant testified that he disputed several of the accounts with \nthe credit reporting agencies. He provided no documentation verifying the disputes and \ndid not provide a substantiated basis for the dispute.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s divorce in \n2007 and his periods of unemployment in 2002 and 2005. I considered the issues \nbetween State A and State B regarding Applicant\u2019s child support obligation.  Applicant \nhas had financial issues since 2001 when he incurred a delinquent federal tax \nobligation. At the close of the record, he had no plan in place to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. He did not mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations and did \nnot meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interests to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 15, 2010, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nwhether the Judge failed to consider all the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse\nsecurity clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the\nfollowing discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nApplicant is an employee of a Defense contractor, working as an analytical chemist.  He\nholds a Ph.D. in chemistry from a well-known university.  He began working for his current\nemployer approximately two years prior to the close of the record.

Decision at 4.  In\n2008, Applicant\u2019s employment with C was terminated, due to a reduction in force.

These documents consisted of a memo attached\nto a classified cover sheet; a document on blue paper, of a kind used to designate a classified\ndocument; a document with classified headers and footers removed by tearing; and a classified\ndocument with marker blackouts of some of its classified content. \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for reliability, trustworthiness, and leadership.

On \nAugust 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR \nto Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nSeptember 15, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline K (handling protected \ninformation).  (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nSOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). \n \nOn September 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On April 22, \n2010, Department Counsel amended the SOR, and added five allegations under \nGuideline E (personal conduct). On April 22, 2010, Department Counsel indicated she \nwas ready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On May 3, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s \ncase to me. On May 7 and 10, 2010, Applicant responded to the Amended SOR. (HE 4) \nOn May 12, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On June 1, 2010, Applicant\u2019s \nhearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 exhibits (GE 1-11) \n(Tr. 23), and Applicant offered 17 exhibits. (Tr. 24-28; AE A-Q) The only objections went \nto the weight of the evidence not to admissibility, and I admitted GE 1-11 and AE A-Q. \n(Tr. 23, 28) Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR, the amended SOR, and Applicant\u2019s responses to the amended SOR. (Tr. 22; HE \n1-4) At his hearing, Applicant was offered an opportunity to submit additional \ndocumentation, especially of his allegations of bias or unethical conduct of his \nsupervisors, after his hearing. (Tr. 50-51, 154) On June 18, 2010, I received the \ntranscript. On July 9, 2010, I received six additional exhibits from Applicant. (AE R-W)  \nThe only objection went to the weight of AE U not to admissibility, and I admitted AE R-\nW. I closed the record on July 10, 2010.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response denied knowledge of inappropriate storage of \nclassified materials in his former office at corporation B, and discussed a variety of \npossible explanations to address the allegation of inappropriate storage of classified \nmaterials. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; HE 3) He admitted he received four documents from his \nemployer which contained negative information about his job performance at \ncorporation B:  \n \n(1) a letter of counseling dated January 25, 2007, regarding his unexcused \nabsence from his workplace on or about January 8, 2007. (SOR \u00b6 2.b; HE 4);  \n \n(2) a performance evaluation dated January 25, 2005, for rating period January \n2004 through September 2004, which stated, \u201cHis more recent task load has been light, \nand questions have been raised as to his \u2018frequently working at home\u2019 or other \nunexplained absences that are not commensurate with his task responsibilities.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 \n2.c; HE 4; GE 10 at 4, Block II);   \n \n \n1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(3) a memorandum dated December 9, 2004, regarding his inability or \nunwillingness to comply with company or section procedures. (SOR \u00b6 2.d, HE 4); and \n  \n(4) a memorandum dated December 9, 2004, regarding his unprofessional \nbehavior in the workplace. (SOR \u00b6 2.e, HE 4)  \n \nHowever, he did not agree that the negative counseling or comments were warranted \nby his conduct. His admissions are accepted as findings as fact.  \n \nApplicant is the 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as a \nPh.D.-level scientist in analytical chemistry. (Tr. 5, 81) He received his Ph.D. from a \nwell-known U.S. educational institute in 1993. (Tr. 5) He is married, and his two children \nare ages 14 and 18. (Tr. 6) He was employed at corporation B, a defense contractor, for \n9 \u00bd years. (GE 2 at 3) About two years ago, he began working for his current employer. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer presented a \u201cKey Contributor Award\u201d to Applicant for his \ncontributions to a work-related project on September 5, 2003. (Tr. 90-94; GE 11 at 11; \nAE G) After the presentation, Applicant sent an email to his supervisors stating, \u201cWhile I \nsincerely appreciate the key contributor award presented this morning, I am fairly \ndisappointed that the potential professional development activity (focus group) was only \na farce. It might be more prudent to disguise future award ceremonies as some less \nmeaningful activity.\u201d (GE 11 at 11) Applicant was disturbed that the presentation was a \nsurprise award ceremony. (Tr. 94) A supervisor, two levels above Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor, responded in a conciliatory and professional manner to Applicant\u2019s email, \nemphasizing his desire to avoid disruption of work and describing the need to hold \nmeetings to explain new organizations and address questions. (Tr. 90-93; GE 11 at 11) \n \n \nApplicant received a December 9, 2004 memorandum from his manager, GB,2 \nregarding Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to comply with company or section \nprocedures. (SOR \u00b6 2.d, HE 4; GE 11 at 1-4) This memorandum cited: (1) \u201can \nunwillingness to present a project review for you[r] project\u201d; (2) issues relating to \n\u201ccompliance with our peer review requirements\u201d; (3) \u201capparent issues with time card \nrecording policies\u201d; and (4) attacks on a management official for \u201chis method in \nrecognizing and rewarding some staff for their excellent performance (including you).\u201d \n(GE 11 at 1) The memorandum used various emails as a basis for these complaints \nabout Applicant\u2019s lack of compliance with procedures. With the exception of Applicant\u2019s \ncomplaint in September 2003 for providing a certificate to Applicant without warning him \nof the presentation, none of the cited emails substantiate management\u2019s complaints \nabout Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to comply with procedures. (GE 11 at 5-11) Although \n \n2 In the late 1990s, Applicant learned that his manager, GB, lied about giving permission to an \nemployee to hold a bake sale. (Tr. 44-45; AE U at 5) When an employee confronted GB about lying about \ngiving permission, GB threatened the employee with disciplinary action for insubordination. (Tr. 45; AE U \nat 5) After that incident Applicant did not trust GB. (AE U at 5) Applicant listed nine additional reasons \nwhy he believed GB was untrustworthy, including that GB had a problem with excessive alcohol \nconsumption. (AE U at 5-6) For example, at a meeting, GB told employees not to play computer games \non their office computers. (Tr. 50) Applicant later observed GB playing computer games on his office \ncomputer. (Tr. 50) \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant bluntly expressed some misgivings about some of the new requirements and \npolicy changes (for example, he indicates the new peer review policy will result in \n\u201cchaos and inefficiency\u201d and he labels a management decision to change the timecard \npolicy as \u201coutrageous\u201d, \u201cstupidity\u201d and an \u201cincredibly poor decision based on a knee-jerk \nresponse\u201d (GE 11 at 9-10)), the attached emails to not contain any refusal by Applicant \nto comply with any policy or procedure.  \n \nApplicant received a December 9, 2004 memorandum regarding Applicant\u2019s \nunprofessional behavior in the workplace. (SOR \u00b6 2.e, HE 4; GE 11 at 1) Under the \ncaption \u201cUnprofessional Behavior\u201d the memorandum included the comment that \nApplicant posted signs on several occasions with personal comments about \nmanagement and noted, \u201cthese signs show a lack of respect for maintaining a \nprofessional work place and a childish and unprofessional attitude.\u201d (GE 11 at 1) \nApplicant posted a message on the door of his office listing priorities \u201cso that anybody \nwho was requesting [his] time would be able to understand very clearly where my \npriorities were.\u201d (Tr. 126) Apparently a project manager noticed the sign and was \nunhappy that his project did not merit a high priority. The memorandum also described \nApplicant\u2019s negative comments in an email about the career rewards for working on a \nlarge project, and asserted Applicant\u2019s comments about the impact on careers was \n\u201cunprofessional and unfounded.\u201d (GE 11 at 1) Applicant\u2019s email was sent to GB and it \ndescribed the large program as \u201cchaos, politics, frustration, and high stress\u201d resulting in \ndamage to one\u2019s career or mental state that could ruin one\u2019s attitude toward \nemployment with Applicant\u2019s corporation. (GE 11 at 5) RB responded with the comment, \n\u201cI need to strongly caution you against advising any staff, especially new staff, that \nworking on [the project] will somehow damage their careers.\u201d (GE 11 at 5) RB also \nobjected to Applicant going over RB\u2019s head to be released from working on a project. \n(GE 11 at 5)   \n \nApplicant received a January 25, 2005 performance evaluation for rating period \nJanuary 2004 through September 2004, which stated, \u201cHis more recent task load has \nbeen light, and questions have been raised as to his \u2018frequently working at home\u2019 or \nother unexplained absences that are not commensurate with his task responsibilities.\u201d \n(GE 10 at 4, Block II) (SOR \u00b6 2.c; HE 4) Applicant said that he had no idea what \nabsences from work were being addressed in this evaluation. (Tr. 116-117; HE 4 at 5) \nApplicant provided a rebuttal to the rating which focused on other performance \nelements, and the cover letter from GB focused on Applicant\u2019s removal from projects \ndue to disagreements with program managers.3 Applicant unsuccessfully sought \nclarification of the basis for the allegation about unauthorized absences from work. (Tr. \n122-123) The file is devoid of specific information about any absences from work during \n2004.  \n \n \n3 A program-manager employee, RS, asked Applicant to certify some analytic chemistry analysis \nresults, and Applicant refused to provide the certification because he did not have time to complete his \nanalysis. (Tr. 46-47) RS reprimanded Applicant for refusing to certify, and Applicant accused RS of \nmisleading the government. (Tr. 47) RS asked GB to remove Applicant from the program. (Tr. 47) GB did \nnot support Applicant\u2019s refusal to comply with RS\u2019 demands, and instead GB ordered Applicant to \ncontinue working with RS. (Tr. 48) \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThere is no adverse documentation pertaining to Applicant from January 25, \n2005 until January 25, 2007. Applicant received a positive rating for the period October \n2004 through May 2005. (GE 9 at 1-2) This rating did not include the negative comment \nabout absences that was included in his previous evaluation.  \n \nApplicant received a letter of counseling on or about January 25, 2007, because \nof his unexcused absence from his workplace on or about January 8, 2007. (SOR \u00b6 2.b; \nHE 4) Applicant said he was the pilot of a small plane that crashed, and he was one day \nlate for work. (Tr. 121-122) He called several staff members and advised them that he \nwas going to be late; however, he was not sure whether anyone told his supervisor, RB, \nthat he was going to be late. (Tr. 124-125) He was supposed to make a presentation at \na conference and his absence caused management some concern.  (Tr. 123-124) He \nprovided his slides to someone to ensure the presentation at the conference could be \nmade. (Tr. 121-125) \n \nAllegations of Management Bias and Retribution \n \nApplicant expressed the concern that management may have placed the \nclassified documents in his office then reported him for a security violation as an act of \nretribution for Applicant\u2019s outspoken criticism of management practices and exposure of \n\u201ccorruption at multiple levels.\u201d (AE U at 8) Applicant said he was determined to expose \nthe corruption in corporation B. (Tr. 58) Applicant asserted that management has an \n\u201cintense motive to destroy\u201d Applicant\u2019s professional career. (AE U at 2) Management\u2019s \nplacement of a classified document in his file cabinet after he departed corporation B \npresented a \u201c[g]olden opportunity that nobody in the division would ever question what \ntook place in [his] former office after [he] left.\u201d (AE U at 2) A security manager, MT, was \naggravated and insulted by Applicant. (Tr. 58) MT was a vengeful person, who had the \nreputation for obtaining retribution against those who upset him. (Tr. 58) GB, RB, and \nMT could have planted classified information in Applicant\u2019s office after he left \nemployment with B because \u201cconditions were ripe for retributions to take place.\u201d (Tr. 59) \nApplicant placed special emphasis on RB as the most likely suspect for placing \nclassified materials in his office to damage Applicant\u2019s reputation and career. (AE U at \n2-4, Item 11) \n \nApplicant also believed management was upset with him because \u201cthey are very \nsensitive to losing seasoned staff.\u201d (Tr. 59) However, Applicant\u2019s assertion that this \nmight be a motive for planting the classified documents in his office seems inconsistent \nwith management forcing Applicant to leave employment through a reduction in force \n(RIF).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor, RB, learned that Applicant was invited to an \nimportant conference scheduled for May 7 and 8, 2007, and instead of permitting him to \nattend, went herself. (Tr. 41-42, 78-79; GE 7 at 1; AE O at 1; AE U at 13-15)4 On May 4, \n \n4 Applicant noted another trip that he made on behalf of corporation B that was coveted by RB, \nstating that when RB learned of his trip, \u201cshe gritted [her] teeth, gave [Applicant] a wild stare and said \u2018I \nshould be on that plane.\u2019\u201d (AE U at 4)  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n2007, Applicant requested an ethics investigation of RB. (Tr. 41-43; 103-105; GE 7 at 1; \nAE U at 14-15) He accused RB of \u201cunethical behavior, and the obvious conflict of \ninterest.\u201d (AE O at 3) An ethics investigation found that RB was invited to attend the \nconference, including an executive session, and Applicant was not invited to attend the \nexecutive session. (GE 7 at 1) RB did not violate ethics rules. (Tr. 43) Shortly thereafter, \nApplicant was removed as task lead on a project for performance reasons unrelated to \nhis complaint about not being permitted to attend the conference (GE 7 at 2); however, \nApplicant alleged that \u201cevidence was fabricated on behalf of management in order to \npresent a case.\u201d (AE O at 4) He accused management of taking retribution for making \nthe complaint against RB or possibly for leaving his name on a survey form. (AE O at 7) \nHe said he realized \u201cthe outrageous nature of [RB\u2019s] apparent ignorance of [the number \nand timing of sample testing relating to the project where he was task lead revealed] \nthat there was no merit to her [argument], since the topic had been discussed so many \ntimes previously.\u201d (AE O at 4) He accused RB and management of making \u201cfabricated \naccusations\u201d and providing \u201cblatant fabrication of scenarios\u201d against him. (AE O at 5, 6) \nHe labeled management\u2019s actions as a \u201ctext book example of the corruption that exists \nwithin multiple levels of management on our division.\u201d (AE O at 7) He urged additional \ninvestigation of management because many \u201cissues exist that have been simply swept \nunder the carpet.\u201d (AE O at 8) \n \n \nIn July 2007, Applicant sent an email to his corporation\u2019s CEO, who then directed \na meeting to address Applicant\u2019s concerns. (Tr. 107-108) Applicant made a PowerPoint \npresentation at the meeting about the procedures and goals for an investigation of \nmanagement. (Tr. 108; AE P)  \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant sought information through a survey from 11 \nemployees in his division about why employees were leaving his company. (Tr. 100-\n101). Applicant chose his sample population from \u201cpeople [in his division] who I knew \nwould not turn me in, people who I trusted.\u201d (Tr. 53-55; AE A at 8-9; AE K) There are \n50-100 people in his division. (Tr. 100-102) Eight employees responded to his survey. \n(Tr. 102) He determined from his survey that management practices were poor. (Tr. 54) \n \nIn December 2007, the CEO directed additional investigation. (Tr. 109; GE 7 at \n3) On December 19, 2007, the ethics committee issued a two-page report reiterating \nthat Applicant\u2019s allegations against management were not substantiated. (Tr. 109-110) \nOn December 20, 2007, Applicant sent a four-page letter, to his CEO, and his letter \nincludes this description of RB:5 \n \n[She] is a corporate accident waiting to happen. She has demoralized a \nwide number of staff, has manipulated people into uncomfortable \npositions, has generated outright lies about the performance of \n \n5 On one occasion RB was unhappy with Applicant because he received a compliment from a \ncustomer. RB showed her unhappiness by \u201csitting in the corner with [the] corners of her mouth pushed \ndown as far as they could go displaying intense aggravation over my compliment from the client.\u201d (AE U \nat 4) Other colleagues described RB to Applicant as \u201cvicious,\u201d \u201cpure evil,\u201d vindictive,\u201d and \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d \n(AE U at 5) \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nsubordinates, has put large programs at risk, has discredited subordinates \nin front of other subordinates and managers, has pursued aggressive \nactivities to intimidate staff, has had people threaten to turn in letters of \nresignation if they are forced to report to her---the list goes on. [RB] is a \nnasty individual whose character is perfectly aligned to perform the \nunethical activities that she has committed against me. It is impossible for \nthe ethics committee to have heard relevant testimony and not come up \nwith a shred of evidence to suggest that the events in question happened \nexactly how I have described them. This is a scenario out of the Twilight \nZone. (AE O at 7)     \n \nApplicant attached his survey results from August 2007 to the December 20, 2007, \nletter. (Tr. 110-111) The survey \u201cdemonstrated the fact that management [of Applicant\u2019s \ndepartment] was atrocious and untrustworthy.\u201d (Tr. 55) A significant percentage of \nresponders to his survey described improper conduct by management, including false \nstatements and false employee performance reviews. (Tr. 57) A stamp on Applicant\u2019s \nDecember 20, 2007 letter shows it was received by his CEO. (Tr. 55, 103; GE 7 at 5) \n \n  \nManagement\u2019s comments on Applicant\u2019s January 8, 2008 performance review \nindicated Applicant did not meet expectations in the area of communications skills, and \nthat improvement was expected in customer focus, expertise, flexibility, and teamwork. \n(GE 6 at 1; AE K) Applicant provided the typed comments on page one and described \nhis performance in very positive terms, such as he \u201cdemonstrated teamwork most \nastoundingly . . ,\u201d whereas he described management as being in panic and \noverreacting to events. (GE 6 at 1; AE K) He subsequently added handwritten \ncomments on the review itself, contesting the review. (Tr. 111-114) He also attached a \ncopy of his August 2007 survey because he wanted human resources \u201cto be aware that \n. . . management is completely out of control.\u201d (Tr. 114) He repeatedly described the \nissues raised in his evaluation as \u201cfabricated performance issues\u201d (AE K at 9, 10, 12)   \n \nImproper storage of classified material \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant improperly stored classified documents in a \ncontainer in his office. His office and the container were not approved for storage of \nclassified material.  \n \nOn February 11, 2008, Applicant left employment with B, due to a RIF. (GE 3 at \n1) Applicant received about an hour of notice, and an administrative assistant was \npresent while Applicant cleared out his office. (Tr. 146-147) A manager from within \nApplicant\u2019s division6 was clearing his office on February 26, 2008, and found four \ndocuments in a file cabinet of security concern:  \n \n \n6 Applicant alleges RB was the person who discovered the classified material in Applicant\u2019s file \ncabinet. (Tr. 57; AE U at 4) As indicated previously, Applicant had a personality conflict with RB. (Tr. 57) \nHowever, GB also had access to Applicant\u2019s office after he left employment with B. (Tr. 59) \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(1) Memorandum from a client dated August 1999, which was attached to a \nclassified cover sheet. \n \n(2) Document dated October 1999 on blue paper describing various processes \nfor chemicals. In 1999, blue paper was used to designate a classified document. \n \n(3) Document dated April 2003, with classified headers and footers removed by \ntearing. \u201cThis was apparently a copy that was being marked up for a work in progress.\u201d \n(GE 3 at 3)  \n \n(4) \u201cAnother apparent work in progress was a classified document with marker \nblackouts of some of the classified content.\u201d (GE 3 at 3) It is unclear whether additional \nclassified information remained in the document. \n \nThe building where the documents were found is not a controlled area. (GE 3 at \n1) Applicant\u2019s office is not a room where open storage of classified material is permitted. \nThe cabinet where the documents were found is not approved for classified storage. \n(GE 3 at 1) For item one, Applicant noted that it would violate the NISPOM for a \nclassified cover to be placed on an unclassified document, and that someone should \nhave placed the classification markings on each page of the memorandum itself, if it \nactually was classified. (Tr. 61-62; AE U at 9)  \n \nFor item two, Applicant said that blue paper was available near the copiers, and \nwas sometimes used for unclassified purposes. (Tr. 61; AE U at 9) If someone left blue \npaper in the copier, Applicant could have copied something onto blue paper that was \nunclassified. (Tr. 61; AE U at 9) \n \nFor items three and four, Applicant explained that sometimes documents had \nspecific parts of the documents marked as classified, and the overall document was \nclassified. (Tr. 62-63; AE I, J; AE U at 9) If the user removed or redacted the classified \nparts, then the user could cross off or tear out the classification markings on the \ndocument. (Tr. 63-65, 95, 148) This scrubbing or declassification process was permitted \nby the employer. (Tr. 65, 128-130, 148; AE V; AE W) Applicant did not have any \ndocumentation authorizing this user-level declassification process. (Tr. 95-96) Applicant \nwas a document control officer at B, and never had any instances where he was cited \nfor improper handling of documents, or for losing accountability for assigned \ndocuments. (Tr. 77) Applicant was never cited for failing to sign-in or sign-out of \ncontrolled-access areas. (Tr. 68) \n \nThe security officer conducting the security violation investigation noted, \u201cA \ndetailed accounting of found classified documents was provided under separate cover \nto affected government agency on 2/28/08 for their assessment.\u201d (GE 3 at 3) The \nresponse to request for assessment is not part of the record evidence. \n \nApplicant provided an affidavit from his current Director of Security, who \nindicated in August 2008, a U.S. Government Security Official telephonically advised \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s company that Applicant \u201chad not committed a classified security infraction.\u201d \n(AE B) The rationale for this determination is not part of the record.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s storage of classified materials was in violation of paragraphs 5-100, \n5-303, and 5-306 of Department of Defense Manual 5220.22-M, National Industrial \nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM). (February 28, 2006). The pertinent \nparagraphs are unchanged from the version in effect from July 31, 1997 to February 28, \n2006, except as indicated in footnotes.  Those three paragraphs provide: \n \n\u00b6 5-100. General. Contractors shall be responsible for safeguarding \nclassified information in their custody or under their control. Individuals are \nresponsible for safeguarding classified information entrusted to them. The \nextent of protection afforded classified information shall be sufficient to \nreasonably foreclose the possibility of its loss or compromise.     \n  \n\u00b6 5-303. SECRET Storage. SECRET material shall be stored in the same \nmanner as TOP SECRET material without supplemental protection or as \nfollows:7 \n \na. A safe, steel file cabinet, or safe-type steel file container that has an \nautomatic unit locking mechanism. All such receptacles will be accorded \nsupplemental protection during non-working hours.8 \n \nb. Any steel file cabinet that has four sides and a top and bottom (all \npermanently attached by welding, rivets or peened bolts so the contents \ncannot be removed without leaving visible evidence of entry) and is \nsecured by a rigid metal lock bar and an approved key operated or \ncombination padlock. The keepers of the rigid metal lock bar shall be \nsecured to the cabinet by welding, rivets, or bolts, so they cannot be \nremoved and replaced without leaving evidence of the entry. The drawers \nof the container shall be held securely, so their contents cannot be \nremoved without forcing open the drawer. This type cabinet will be \naccorded supplemental protection during non-working hours.  \n \n5-306. Closed Areas. Due to the size and nature of the classified \nmaterial, or operational necessity, it may be necessary to construct Closed \nAreas for storage because GSA-approved containers or vaults are \nunsuitable or impractical. Closed Areas must be approved by the CSA and \n \n7 The February 28, 2006 version of this subparagraph states, \u201c5-303. SECRET Storage. \nSECRET material shall be stored in a GSA-approved security container, an approved vault, or closed \narea. Supplemental controls are required for storage in closed areas. The following additional storage \nmethods may be used until October 1, 2012:\u201d \n \n8 The February 28, 2006 version of this subparagraph states, \u201ca. A safe, steel file cabinet, or safe-\ntype steel file container that has an automatic unit locking mechanism. All such receptacles will be \naccorded supplemental protection during non-working hours.\u201d \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nbe constructed in accordance with Section 8 of this Chapter. Access to \nClosed Areas must be controlled to preclude unauthorized access. This \nmay be accomplished through the use of a cleared employee or by a \nsupplanting access control device or system. Access shall be limited to \nauthorized persons who have an appropriate security clearance and a \nneed-to-know for the classified material/information within the area. \nPersons without the appropriate level of clearance and/or need to know \nshall be escorted at all times by an authorized person where inadvertent \nor unauthorized exposure to classified information cannot otherwise be \neffectively prevented. The Closed Area shall be accorded supplemental \nprotection during non-working hours. During such hours, admittance to the \narea shall be controlled by locked entrances and exits secured by either \nan approved built-in combination lock or an approved combination or key-\noperated padlock. However, doors secured from the inside with a panic \nbolt (for example, actuated by a panic bar), a dead bolt, a rigid wood or \nmetal bar, or other means approved by the CSA, will not require additional \nlocking devices.9 \n \n9 The February 28, 2006 version of paragraph 5-306 states: \n \n5-306. Closed Areas. Due to the size and nature of the classified material, or for \noperational necessity, it may be necessary to construct closed areas for storage because \nGSA-approved containers or vaults are unsuitable or impractical. Closed areas must be \nconstructed in accordance with section 8 of this chapter. Access to closed areas must be \ncontrolled to preclude unauthorized access. This may be accomplished through the use \nof a cleared person or by a supplanting access control device or system. Access shall be \nlimited to authorized persons who have an appropriate security clearance and a need-to-\nknow for the classified material/information within the area. Persons without the \nappropriate level of clearance and/or need to know shall be escorted at all times by an \nauthorized person where inadvertent or unauthorized exposure to classified information \ncannot otherwise be effectively prevented. Closed areas storing TOP SECRET and \nSECRET material shall be accorded supplemental protection during non-working hours. \nDuring non-working hours and during working hours when the area is unattended, \nadmittance to the area shall be controlled by locked entrances and exits secured by \neither an approved built-in combination lock or an approved combination or key-operated \npadlock. It is not necessary to activate the supplemental controls during working hours. \nDoors secured from the inside with a panic bolt (for example, actuated by a panic bar, a \ndead bolt, a rigid wood or metal bar) or other means approved by the CSA, will not \nrequire additional locking devices.  \n \na. Contractors shall develop and implement procedures to ensure the structural integrity \nof closed areas above false ceilings and below raised floors.  \n \nb. Open shelf or bin storage of SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL documents in closed areas \nrequires CSA approval. For SECRET material only areas protected by an approved \nIntrusion Detection System (IDS) will qualify for such approval. Open shelf or bin storage \nof TOP SECRET documents is not permitted.  \n \nc. The CSA and the contractor shall agree on the need to establish, and the extent of, \nclosed areas prior to the award of the contract, when possible, or when the need for such \nareas becomes apparent during contract performance.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \na. Open shelf or bin storage of classified documents in Closed Areas \nrequires CSA approval. Only areas protected by an approved intrusion \ndetection system will qualify for such approval. \n \nb. The CSA and the contractor shall agree on the need to establish, and \nthe extent of, Closed Areas prior to the award of the contract, when \npossible, or at such subsequent time as the need for such areas becomes \napparent during performance on the contract. \n \n \nAs an example of his timely compliance with security rules, Applicant said when \nhe learned camera-cell phones were not permitted in the work area, he immediately \nscratched out the lens in his cell phone.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in \nthis Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nin part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a security \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  The DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly stated: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole \nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them \napply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the \nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  \n \nISCR Case No. 09-01015 at 3 (App. Bd. July 16, 2010); ISCR Case No. 07-16427 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010); ISCR Case No. 07-16841 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2008).  \n  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline K (handling protected information) and E (personal \nconduct).  \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nHandling Protected Information \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 33 articulates the security concern relating to handling protected \ninformation: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nAG \u00b6 34 provides nine handling protected information disqualifying conditions \nthat could raise a security concern:  \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of classified or other protected \ninformation to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to personal \nor business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at seminars, \nmeetings, or conferences; \n \n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \nin any other unauthorized location; \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \n\u201cpalm\u201d or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; \n \n(d) inappropriate efforts to obtain or view classified or other protected \ninformation outside one's need to know; \n \n(e) copying classified or other protected information in a manner designed \nto conceal or remove classification or other document control markings; \n \n(f) viewing or downloading information from a secure system when the \ninformation is beyond the individual's need-to-know; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; \n \n(h) negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement; and \n \n(i) failure to comply with rules or regulations that results in damage to the \nNational Security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or negligent. \n \nOn March 7, 2008, a security investigation concluded that four documents found \nin a filing cabinet, not authorized for storage of classified materials, raised security \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nconcerns: (1) August 1999 memorandum from a client, which was attached to a \nclassified cover sheet; (2) October 1999 document on blue paper describing various \nprocesses for chemicals. In 1999, blue paper was used to designate a classified \ndocument; (3) April 2003 document with classified headers and footers removed by \ntearing. \u201cThis was apparently a copy that was being marked up for a work in progress;\u201d \nand (4) \u201cAnother apparent work in progress was a classified document with marker \nblackouts of some of the classified content.\u201d The investigation does not establish by \nsubstantial evidence that items one, three, and four were classified. They were not \nproperly marked as classified. The employer permits employees to declassify \ndocuments by scrubbing or deleting the information they believe is classified and then \nmarking through the classification or removing the classification markings. The file does \nnot contain an \u201cassessment\u201d from the classification authority establishing that the three \ndocuments were classified.  \n \nI conclude item two was established by substantial evidence to be a classified \ndocument. See discussion of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d in Policies section, supra. The \ncontents of the document were printed on blue paper, which the employer used for \nclassified documents. \u201cThere is a rebuttable presumption of regularity in administrative \nproceedings.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-15235 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2008). According, I must \npresume the blue document was actually classified. I am not convinced that Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor, program manager, or anyone else placed the classified document into \nApplicant\u2019s file cabinet and then \u201cdiscovered it\u201d after Applicant had already left \nemployment with corporation B. The storage cabinet was not an authorized storage \nlocation for the classified document. I conclude Applicant negligently, as opposed to \ndeliberately, failed to comply with the rules for storage of classified material. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n34(b) and 34(g) apply and further inquiry is necessary about the applicability of any \nmitigating conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 35 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns stating: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. The classified document was \ndiscovered on February 26, 2008, which is relatively recent. Applicant did not accept full \nresponsibility for improper storage of the classified document. Applicant had sufficient \ntraining to understand his security responsibilities. He demonstrates a positive attitude \ntowards security; however, the passage of more time without any security violations is \nnecessary before handling protected information concerns can be mitigated. \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThree personal conduct disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(2), and \n16(d)(3), are potentially applicable. Those three disqualifying conditions provide:   \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; \nand \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(2) apply; however, AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to ensure a classified document was property stored, which is a rule \nviolation; however, additional rule violations are not established and there is no pattern \nof rule violations. Applicant missed work on January 8, 2007, and was unsure whether \nanyone told his supervisor he would not be present for duty. There is insufficient \nevidence that he intentionally violated a leave policy. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) A memorandum \nalleges Applicant had unexplained absences from January 2004 to September 2004; \nhowever, there is no specific evidence about when these absences occurred. They are \ntoo vague to be substantiated (SOR \u00b6 2.c) The allegation that Applicant failed to comply \nwith procedures as outlined in the December 9, 2004, memorandum is not established \nby substantial evidence. (SOR \u00b6 2.d)  \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nOn December 9, 2004, management issued a memorandum alleging Applicant \nengaged in unprofessional behavior in the workplace. (SOR \u00b6 2.e) It alleged he posted \na sign on his office door concerning his priorities, and he sent an email to his manager \nabout the stressful, unrewarding work on a particular project. The sign on his door was \ninappropriate behavior because it was basically a statement that he was not going to \nwork on low priority projects. The tone of the email to his manager was sufficiently \nnegative to constitute inappropriate behavior in the workplace. This conduct shows \nquestionable judgment and establishes AG \u00b6 16(d)(2). Additionally, a classified \ndocument was discovered in his office in February 2008 after he left employment with \ncorporation B. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a) The 2008 security violation and his 2004 \ninappropriate behavior in combination as part of a \u201cwhole-person assessment\u201d establish \nAG \u00b6 16(c). \n \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;   \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nAny security concerns raised under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d is mitigated under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(e), and 17(f). For example, when Applicant was absent from work on \nJanuary 8, 2007, there were excellent extenuating circumstances. He was the pilot of a \nplane that crashed, and he called colleagues to let them know he would miss one day of \nduty. His supervisor showed poor judgment when she failed to incorporate extenuating \nfacts in her counseling statement. (GE 8 at 2) The allegation that he had unexplained \nabsences from January 2004 to September 2004 has been rebutted. Applicant said he \nwas not aware of any unexplained absences, and there is no documentation describing \na single unauthorized absence during this time period. The allegation that Applicant \nfailed to comply with procedures as outlined in the December 9, 2004 memorandum is \nunsubstantiated. Applicant provided some evidence of his excellent character for \nhonesty, reliability, and trustworthiness. His evaluations, awards, and character \nwitnesses opine that he is trustworthy and has good judgment.   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.e are established and not fully rebutted. Applicant failed to \nensure a classified document was property stored. Applicant\u2019s unprofessional behavior \n\n \n18 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nin the workplace in 2004 would be mitigated but for the unfair, derogatory statements he \nsubsequently made to management that are not listed in the SOR.10 Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor had a right to ask to go to the conference in lieu of Applicant\u2019s attendance. \nManagement had a right to send whomever they wanted to the conference. Applicant\u2019s \nclaim that it was unethical or dishonest to send his supervisor to the May 7 and 8, 2007 \nconference is unwarranted and inappropriate conduct. His refusal to accept the \njudgment of the ethics investigation and his response to his evaluation shows poor \njudgment. In July 2007, he wrote a four-page letter to his CEO, and in his response to \nhis January 8, 2008, performance review, he used intemperate, disrespectful language \nthat showed he had not learned that such language was unprofessional and showed \npoor judgment. His comments in 2007 and 2008 were insubordinate, inappropriate, and \ndisrespectful, and such behavior is likely in the future, if he has a dispute with his \nemployers over decisions the employer makes. More time is necessary without \nApplicant engaging in abusive conduct before personal conduct security concerns will \nbe fully alleviated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n10The SOR did not allege that Applicant made insubordinate, disrespectful, and derogatory \ncomments about his supervisor and manager concerning his supervisor\u2019s attendance at the May 7 and 8, \n2007 conference, in a four-page letter in July 2007 to his CEO, and in his response to his January 8, \n2008, performance review. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR misconduct for purposes of (a), (b), (c), and (e), and not \nfor any other purpose. \n\n \n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines K and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport access to classified information at this time, there are several factors tending to \nsupport approval of his clearance. Applicant is 43 years old. He is sufficiently mature to \nunderstand and comply with his security responsibilities. He has a lengthy history of \ntimely compliance with security rules, with only one documented exception. He was \ncommended by security staff for his conscientious enforcement of security rules. The \nSecurity Director at his present employment has an extraordinary security background, \nand he vouches for Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability. There were no security \nissues over the last two years at his current employment. He did not have any timecard \nviolations. Applicant does not gamble, use illegal drugs, consume alcohol, or have a \ncriminal record. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. \nGovernment as an employee of a contractor. There is every indication that he is loyal to \nthe United States and his current employer. His previous employment was a stressful \nenvironment for him, and providing some extenuation for the intemperate comments he \nmade to his supervisory chain. Several character witnesses laud his diligence, \nprofessionalism, and responsibility. I give Applicant credit for admitting that he made the \ninsubordinate, disrespectful statements about management at the company where he \nwas previously employed. I accept his statement as truthful that he does not remember \never storing the classified document (on blue paper) in his filing cabinet. These factors \nshow some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. He stored a classified document in an improper container \nat some time prior to its discovery in February 2008, risking its compromise. He has a \nhistory of intemperate, insubordinate, and disrespectful comments to management in \n2004, 2007, and 2008. His relationship with management at corporation B raises \nquestions about his judgment reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \n \nI have carefully applied the law to the facts and circumstances in the context of \nthe whole person, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs. I conclude Applicant has not fully mitigated \nthe handling protected information and personal conduct concerns at this time. The \npassage of more time is necessary without conduct raising a security concern before \ngranting access to classified information will be warranted.  \n \n\n \n20 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:    \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b to 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 6, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 25, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nunder Guideline J were internally inconsistent, contrary to the record evidence, and arbitrary and\n\ncapricious; whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions under Guideline E were arbitrary, capricious, and\ncontrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was arbitrary and capricious.\nConsistent with the following, we reverse the Judge\u2019s decision.  \nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 36-year-old\nengineering technician for a Defense contractor.  He has attended technical school.  Married, he has\ntwo children.  \nIn 2000, Applicant took an airplane trip from his state of residence to another state for the\npurpose of obtaining marijuana.  Applicant and an accomplice intended to return to their home state\nand sell the marijuana for a profit.  When Applicant checked into the airport for the return trip, drug\ndogs alerted on his luggage.  A search uncovered 106 pounds of marijuana.  Applicant pled guilty\nto a charge of possession of marijuana weighing more than 50 lbs but less than 2000 lbs.  The court\nconcluded that the evidence substantiated his guilt but deferred an adjudication of guilt, imposing\ncommunity service, 10 years of community supervision, a fine, and payment of court costs.  \nIn 2003, Applicant flew from his hometown to a major city in his state of residence.\nApplicant and a friend then proceeded to drive from that city to another.  Although the car was\nowned by Applicant\u2019s friend, Applicant was driving.  A policeman stopped the car upon the\nappearance of erratic driving.  The policeman advised that he smelled marijuana, and Applicant\u2019s\nfriend acknowledged that he had a small amount of marijuana on his person.  Applicant was aware\nthat his friend was in possession of this marijuana.  The policeman searched the car and found a\nfirearm belonging to the friend.  Applicant was arrested on a charge of driving without a license and\nhis friend was arrested for possession of marijuana.  A subsequent search of the car\u2019s trunk\nuncovered 2.7 pounds of marijuana secreted in a cooler.  This search also uncovered four stolen\nlottery tickets.  Applicant was charged with (1) possession of marijuana with intent to sell, which\nwas a felony; (2) possession of a firearm within arm\u2019s reach, also a felony; (3) receiving stolen\nproperty, a misdemeanor; and (4) possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime.  This\nlast offense was also a felony.\nPursuant to a plea agreement, Applicant pled guilty to possession of marijuana with intent\nto distribute.  In return the prosecutor recommended probation and a reduced fine, dropping the\nremaining charges.  During the court hearing, Applicant was questioned about the offense in order\nto establish the providence of his plea of guilty.\nProsecutor: Okay.  Where did you get the marijuana?\n[Applicant]: The marijuana\u2013I didn\u2019t get the marijuana, [friend] did.\nProsecutor: [Friend] got the marijuana.  Was it his idea?\n[Applicant]: Yes, it was.\nProsecutor: Did you see him put it in the cooler?\n\n[Applicant]: No, I didn\u2019t.\nProsecutor: But you knew it was back there inside the cooler?\n[Applicant]: Yes.\nProsecutor: Did he tell you he did it?\n[Applicant]: I knew it because I knew he did it.  He had it in the cooler.\nDecision at 6.\nThe court sentenced Applicant to a fine and seven years probation.  \nSince his 2003 arrest, Applicant has not seen his friend.  He has not been involved in drugs\nor with the police since 2003.  \nIn 2009, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator pursuant to his application for\na security clearance.  During this interview, he addressed the circumstances underlying his 2003\nconviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.  He stated to the interviewer that he\nwas \u201cshocked by the charges for marijuana and stolen lottery tickets as he had no knowledge of\nthese items being in the car.\u201d  Decision at 7.  At the hearing in the case before us now, Applicant\nacknowledged to having pled guilty as described above.  However, he contended that, at the time\nof his arrest, he did not actually know that marijuana was in the car.  He testified that he only learned\nabout it later.  In answers to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that he last possessed marijuana\nin 2000.  He denied responsibility for the offense.\nDiscussion \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\n\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the Guidelines J and E security\nconcerns did not take into account contrary record evidence.  We find her arguments persuasive.\nThe SOR alleged, in paragraph 1, the following conduct under Guideline J:\na.  You were arrested in about August 2000 in [State A], and charged with\nPossession of Marijuana, More than 50 pounds, Less than 2000 Pounds.  You\npleaded guilty and were sentenced to 10 years of community supervision and ordered\nto pay a $750.00 fine and court costs.\nb.  You were arrested in about May 2003 in [State B] and charged with (1) and (2)\ntwo Counts of Violation of [State] Controlled Substance Act, (3) and (4) two Counts\nof Possession of a Firearm During the Commission of Felony and (5) Theft by\nReceiving.  You were found guilty of Count (1) and the other Counts were nolle\nprosequi.  You were sentenced to seven years probation and fined.\nc.  That information set forth under paragraph 2, below, which constitutes a violation\nof Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.   \nParagraph 2 of the SOR contained the sole Guideline E allegation:\nDuring a subject interview with an authorized investigator for the Department of\nDefense on January 12, 2009, you falsified material facts in that you stated in\nreference to your 2003 arrest, as set forth in subparagraph 1.b above, that you had no\nknowledge of any marijuana in the vehicle you were arrested in; whereas in truth,\nyou deliberately failed to disclose that you were aware of the marijuana in the\nvehicle, and that you were transporting the marijuana with the other passenger in the\nvehicle, as cited in your court courtroom testimony during your hearing.\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 20, 2010, Applicant stated, \u201cI admit\u201d to each of these\nallegations.  His admissions were not accompanied by explanations or otherwise qualified in any\nway.

In particular, she stated that \u201cthe Government provided\nsubstantial evidence for its allegation of falsification in SOR \u00b6 1.c.\u201d  Substantial evidence means\n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in\nlight of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 2 (App. Bd.\nSep. 9, 2010).  Department Counsel states that these conclusions were supported by the record.\nDepartment Counsel is correct.  Because Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, they are\nnot controverted.  Accordingly, these admissions relieved the Government of any burden of\nproducing evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.  (The Government \u201cis responsible for presenting\nwitnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.\u201d)\nSee also ISCR Case No. 02-21087 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2001).   Second, even without reference\nto Applicant\u2019s admissions, the Government presented evidence of Applicant\u2019s alleged misconduct,\nincluding police reports, arrest warrants, and the transcript of his 2003 court hearing, part of which\nthe Judge quoted in her findings.  These exhibits, read in the context of the entire record, to include\nApplicant\u2019s testimony, constitute substantial evidence of the Guideline J security concerns which\nDOHA alleged in the SOR.  Furthermore, as the Judge noted in her Guideline E analysis, Applicant\nis barred from re-litigating his felony conviction in a DOHA proceeding.\nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge erred in her treatment of Applicant\u2019s\ncase for mitigation.  Department Counsel notes a significant inconsistency in the Judge\u2019s analysis.\nAlthough, as stated above, the Judge had concluded that the record contained substantial evidence\nof the alleged misconduct, to include the false statement, she went on to state that \u201cApplicant did\nnot falsify his statement to the OPM investigator.\u201d  The Judge then proceeded to analyze the\nGuideline J security concerns on the view that Applicant did not make the false statement and on\nthe apparent assumption that he was not guilty of the 2003 felony offense as well.  \nUnder the facts of this case, the Judge\u2019s analysis is inconsistent.  Having found that the\nrecord contained \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept . . . in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the record\u201d that Applicant made a deliberately false statement during his\nclearance investigation, it was contradictory for the Judge to have gone on to conclude that, in fact,\nhe did not do so.  Her conclusion that he did not falsify the statement is also contradicted by a\nportion of her analysis under Guideline E.  Although we defer to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination,\nwhen, as here, an applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and the record evidence viewed as a whole\nsupport a conclusion that Applicant committed misconduct, a Judge must explain why he or she\nbelieves an applicant\u2019s testimony to the contrary.  Failure to do so gives rise to the possibility that\nthe Judge has simply substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record\nevidence.  Explanations that are self-contradictory on the essential point are per se unreasonable and\nare not sustainable.\nConcerning the 2003 drug offense, the record contains substantial evidence not merely that\nApplicant pled guilty to this offense but that he was, in fact, guilty.  Among other things, the prior\nsimilar offense in 2000 is relevant on the question of Applicant\u2019s knowledge and intent during the\n2003 incident.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 404(b).1  The Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion regarding mitigation\n\n2See, e.g., Tr. at 34: \u201cQ: . . . [Y]ou were asked several times if you knew about the marijuana in the car.  And\neach time, you said, \u2018Yes\u2019 . . . [W]hy didn\u2019t you say, \u2018I didn\u2019t find out until after we were in jail? A: I had\u2013 I\u2019ll tell you\nthe yes on that.  I\u2019m not \u2013 I just \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know anything about as far as when that \u2013 when that \u2013 when I was\nnotified.  I didn\u2019t \u2013 as far as when the \u2013 when the traffic stop, actually stopped, I didn\u2019t know about it.\u201d  \n3In her analysis, the Judge characterized Applicant as a man with only a high school education, who did not\n\u201cunderstand the nuances of the law[.]\u201d Decision at 12.  She made this statement in support of her belief that Applicant\ndid not understand that \u201cintent to distribute\u201d marijuana meant his intent at the time of the offense.  However, Applicant\nwas represented at trial by counsel.      \n4Under Guideline J, the Judge found that the Government had presented substantial evidence of a false\nstatement.  In her analysis of the same Guideline, however, she stated that she had \u201cfound that Applicant did not falsify\nhis statement to the OPM investigator[.]\u201d Decision at 11.  Again, under Guideline E the Judge stated that Applicant did\nnot know about the marijuana at the time of his arrest.  However, she also found that his statement that he did not know\nabout the marijuana at the time of his arrest was deliberately false.  A Judge may weigh the same conduct differently\nunder different guidelines.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-08257 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2008).  However, even when\ndid not take into account the extent to which a reasonable person could find Applicant\u2019s presentation\nat the hearing to be lacking credibility.2  Viewed in light of the totality of the record evidence, the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion in mitigation of the Guideline\nJ security concerns is not supportable.3 \nDepartment Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge erred in her analysis of Guideline\nE as well.  The sole allegation under Guideline E was Applicant\u2019s false denial to the investigator of\nany knowledge, at the time of the offense, of the presence of marijuana in the cooler in his friend\u2019s\ncar.  As stated above, Applicant admitted this allegation in his reply to the SOR.  Therefore, the\nallegation was not controverted, relieving the Government of any burden of producing further\nevidence.  However, the Government did produce evidence that Applicant had known at the time\nof his arrest that the marijuana was present in the car and that, accordingly, his denial to OPM was\ndeliberately false.  \nIn her analysis, however, the Judge did not discuss the legal effect of Applicant\u2019s SOR\nadmission.  As she had done under Guideline J, she analyzed the record evidence to determine\nwhether the Government had met its burden of production, concluding that it had done so.  Although\nDepartment Counsel argued that the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion on this matter was correct, she\nfurther argued that the reasoning whereby the Judge reached this conclusion was erroneous.  We find\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.  The Judge summarized Applicant\u2019s testimony that he\nhad not known about the marijuana in the trunk of his friend\u2019s car, treating this testimony as true.\nUpon that assumption, she could not have found that his statement to the investigator was false.\nHowever, she went on to state, \u201c[g]iven his statement that he learned about the marijuana while in\nthe holding cell, he did not provide truthful and accurate information to the OPM investigator about\nthe circumstances surrounding his 2003 arrest.\u201d  Decision at 13. (emphasis added) If the Judge\nbelieved that Applicant did not know about the marijuana at the time of his arrest, she could not\nlogically have found that his statement to the investigator denying such knowledge was knowingly\nfalse.  Her analysis of this issue is contradictory, as was her analysis under Guideline J.  Although\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the Government had presented substantial evidence of a false\nstatement is supportable, the analysis whereby she attempted to arrive at this conclusion is arbitrary\nand capricious.4 \n\nevaluating different guidelines, a Judge cannot find that the same conduct both occurred and did not occur, in the same\nway at the same time.  \nThe Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government had met its burden of production under\nGuideline E required her to evaluate Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation.  Department Counsel contends\nthat the Judge\u2019s analysis of this issue is not supportable.  This analysis consisted of the following:\nAfter his arrest almost eight years [ago], Applicant has changed his behavior and\nfriends.  He stays away from individuals engaged in criminal activity, particularly\nindividuals who are involved with drugs.  He focuses his energy on his family and\nhis work.  For more than six years, he has worked successfully with the same\ncompany.  In his spare time, he plays drums at his church.  He actively made a\ndecision to stay away form his earlier acquaintances, which has changed the\ndirection of his life.  This decision show maturity, good judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nThis was the extent of the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis under Guideline E.  The sole allegation\nunder that Guideline was a false statement to an interviewer in 2009, yet the Judge discussed only\nApplicant\u2019s claim to have avoided further drug offenses since 2000 and evidence of his good\nemployment record, etc.  Absence of other drug offenses cannot logically mitigate security concerns\narising from Applicant\u2019s recent false statement.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s work history and devotion\nto his family, while not irrelevant, are nevertheless insufficient to mitigate an offense that strikes at\nthe heart of the security clearance process.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07575 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 10,\n2010).  As Department Counsel observed in her brief, there is no evidence that Applicant attempted\nto correct his false statement or that he had made it in reliance upon legal advice, etc.  The Judge\u2019s\nfavorable conclusion as to mitigation under this Guideline is not supportable on this record. \nDepartment Counsel has challenged the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis, citing a number of\ncomments from the Decision which she argues constitute error.  For example, she cites to the\nJudge\u2019s statement that \u201cApplicant has been honest and forthcoming about his two arrests.\u201d  For\nreasons set forth above, we conclude that this statement is not supportable regarding the 2003\noffense.  Department Counsel also persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s statement that Applicant had\nbeen honest throughout the security clearance process was belied by evidence of Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate false statement to the interviewer.  We note other evidence that undermines this statement\nby the Judge.  Applicant testified, and the Judge found, that he was aware that his friend had\nmarijuana on his person at the time of the 2003 offense.  Tr. at 26-27.  In his security clearance\napplication, however, Applicant stated \u201cI was not aware that any illegal drugs were in the vehicle\nat the time we were stopped.\u201d  Government Exhibit 1 at 24.  This inconsistency further undermines\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had been honest during the security clearance process.  The\nrecord evidence viewed as a whole does not support the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis.   \nWe note Applicant\u2019s Reply Brief, in which he attempts to explain the discrepancy between\nhis testimony to the court in 2003 and his testimony at his security clearance hearing.  \u201cIn 2003 I did\nadmit to a felony marijuana charge.  I was asked if I knew marijuana was in the cooler and I stated\n\u2018yes.\u2019  In my [security clearance] hearing . . . I was very nervous, worried and tense about having\n\nto relive my past mistakes all over again.  I recall stating that I didn\u2019t know that the marijuana [was]\nin the cooler but again I was very tense and worried.\u201d  He appears to concede Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument that his hearing testimony was not accurate, attributing the problem to stress.  Applicant\u2019s\nReply Brief provides no reason to reject Department Counsel\u2019s arguments.\nIn light of (1) Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions to two instances of possessing marijuana with\nintent to distribute and one instance of a deliberately false statement to an OPM investigator; (2)\nrecord evidence demonstrating the same; (3) inconsistent statements by Applicant; and (4) the\npaucity of mitigating evidence, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable under the Egan\nstandard.  \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

In 2000, Applicant took an airplane trip from his state of residence to another state for the purpose of obtaining marijuana. Applicant and an accomplice intended to return to their home state and sell the marijuana for a profit. When Applicant checked into the airport for the return trip, drug dogs alerted on his luggage. A search uncovered 106 pounds of marijuana. Applicant pled guilty to a charge of possession of marijuana weighing more than 50 lbs but less than 2000 lbs. The court concluded that the evidence substantiated his guilt but deferred an adjudication of guilt, imposing community service, 10 years of community supervision, a fine, and payment of court costs. In 2003, Applicant flew from his hometown to a major city in his state of residence. Applicant and a friend then proceeded to drive from that city to another. Although the car was owned by Applicant\u2019s friend, Applicant was driving. A policeman stopped the car upon the appearance of erratic driving. The policeman advised that he smelled marijuana, and Applicant\u2019s friend acknowledged that he had a small amount of marijuana on his person. Applicant was aware that his friend was in possession of this marijuana. The policeman searched the car and found a firearm belonging to the friend. Applicant was arrested on a charge of driving without a license and his friend was arrested for possession of marijuana.

The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR)  on July 6, 2010 detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that provided the basis for its preliminary\ndecision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 25, 2011\n\nGiven his trial testimony, Applicant admitted  the omission of the facts set forth in SOR \u00b6 2.a, but he did not\n1\nadmit intentional falsification.\nGE 1; Tr. 15-16.\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 19, 2010.

DOHA received the request on July 23, 2010, and Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on September 28, 2010. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 4, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 26, 2010, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on November 17, 2010. The Government offered\ngovernment exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. Applicant and two witnesses testified. He did not submit any exhibits.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 2, 2010.

The sole purpose of their trip was to obtain marijuana,\nwhich they intended to take home and sell for profit. They received the drugs and\nreturned to the airport for their trip home. Applicant checked two large suitcases\ncontaining the  marijuana. As he walked through the airport, local police observed his\nbehavior, which they found suspicious. After the suitcases had been checked with the\nairline, police canines detected drugs. The police detained Applicant, who gave them\npermission to inspect the suitcases. The police found nine vacuum sealed packages\ncontaining marijuana with an approximate weight of 106 pounds. The police arrested\nand charged him the same day. The grand jury issued an indictment against Applicant\non August 24, 2000.  \n4\nApplicant appeared in court on September 11, 2000 with his legal counsel. He\nplead guilty to the charge of possession of marijuana weighing more than 50 pounds,\nbut less than 2000 pounds. After hearing the evidence, the court concluded the\nevidence substantiated the defendant\u2019s (Applicant\u2019s) guilt. With Applicant\u2019s consent, the\ncourt deferred adjudication,  as permitted by the state criminal code. The court declined\n5\nto enter a finding of guilt, placed Applicant on community supervision for 10 years, fined\nhim $750, plus other costs and fees, and ordered that he perform 350 hours of\ncommunity service, attend drug education classes, and participate in treatment\nalternatives to incarceration programs. His community supervision program imposed\nnumerous other conditions on him. The court also transferred his supervision to his\nhome state. Applicant completed the requirements of his community supervision. On\nJuly 30, 2007, the adjudicating court discharged Applicant from further community\nsupervision and dismissed the proceedings against Applicant. The court did not enter a\nfinding of guilty against Applicant. He has accepted full responsibility for his conduct.6\nOn May 15, 2003, Applicant flew from his hometown to a major city about 250\nmiles away, intending to drive to a small city another 180 miles distant to attend a\ncookout and to pick up his brother for the return trip home. Mr. H, a friend whom he had\nknown casually for four or five years and saw once or twice a year, drove to the major\ncity airport. Applicant drove Mr. H\u2019s car to the smaller city. On the way, the police\nstopped him for failure to maintain lanes. During the stop, the police accused him of\ndriving on a suspended license, and driving after drinking. Neither of the accusations\nwere true. The police also told him they smelled marijuana and searched the car with\ndrug detection dogs. No drugs were found, although Mr. H told the police he had a small\namount of marijuana on his person. Applicant was aware of Mr. H\u2019s possession of this\nsmall amount. The search of the car also produced a firearm, belonging to Mr. H, who\nhad a license for the firearm. The police arrested and charged Applicant with driving on\na suspended license and arrested Mr. H for possession of less than one ounce of\n\nGE 3; Tr. 20-23, 26-27, 41-42.\n7\nGE 6.\n8\nId.; Tr. 25, 44-45.\n9\n4\nmarijuana. While in the holding cell, Mr. H told Applicant that the police missed the\ndrugs in the cooler in the trunk of the car. After this conversation, Mr. H paid bail and the\npolice released him. In the meantime, a jailhouse informant told the police about their\nconversation. The police searched the car again, and found 2.7 pounds of marijuana\nand four stolen lottery tickets. The police filed charges against Applicant for possession\nof marijuana and stolen lottery tickets. Applicant denied any knowledge of the lottery\ntickets and of the marijuana in the cooler prior to his conversation with Mr. H in the\nholding cell.7\nAfter the grand jury issued an indictment against Applicant and Mr. H, on May 19,\n2003, the local sheriff served Applicant with four criminal arrest warrants, charging him\nwith possession of marijuana with the intent to sell, a felony; with possession of a\nfirearm within arms reach, a felony; theft by receiving stolen property, a misdemeanor;\nand possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, a felony. Applicant\nobtained an attorney to represent him in this matter.8\nApplicant appeared in court on February 23, 2004. Prior to his court appearance,\nApplicant and his attorney discussed the charges against Applicant. They weighed the\nproblems Applicant faced because Mr. H was not accepting responsibility for his\nconduct related to the lottery ticket and marijuana in the cooler. His attorney advised\nhim that this was a \u201che said, he said\u201d case and that Mr. H was trying to shift his conduct\nonto Applicant because of Applicant\u2019s previous arrest and ongoing probation. Applicant\nunderstood that he faced the possibility of some jail time. Upon the advice of his\nattorney, Applicant agreed to plead guilty to one count of possession of marijuana with\nthe intent to sell, a felony. The prosecutor offered Applicant this plea along with a\nrecommendation for probation and a reduced fine. The prosecutor dismissed the\nremaining charges, including the possession of stolen lottery tickets charge and the\nfirearms charges.  \n9\nWhen Applicant appeared in court to enter his plea, the following colloquy took\nplace:\nProsecutor: Factual basis: On the date stated in the indictment, Deputy L\nwas sitting on the interstate. He noticed this car was weaving outside of its\nlane, actually going down one lane, I think, riding the line for several\nhundred feet, maybe even a mile. He initiated a traffic stop. He smelled\nthe odor of burnt marijuana, decided to inquire about his insurance. When\nDeputy L inquired as to the status of [Applicant\u2019s] license, dispatch told\nhim it was suspended. However, it actually wasn\u2019t suspended\n[emphasis supplied] but that was what Mr. L or Deputy L was told, that it\n\n5\nwas. He therefore placed him under arrest, put him in the back of the\npatrol car. He went over to the passenger to find out information on the\npassenger. The passenger said he did have a valid driver\u2019s license; it was\nactually his car. Deputy L\u2019s K-9 unit alerted on the vehicle. He then\nsearched the vehicle but didn\u2019t find anything. Mr. H [passenger] said I\nhave a cigarette joint on me. He was placed under arrest. They were both\ntransferred to the jail. While in jail, a confidential informant overheard\nsome conversation they were having as to the marijuana that the officer\nhad missed. That informant then went and told Investigator R. that there\nwas some marijuana inside a cooler in the back trunk of the vehicle. The\nofficer went and got a search warrant and went to search the car. It had\nbeen impounded since they were arrested. When they [police] went to go\ndo the search, they found 2.7 pounds of marijuana in an ice chest in the\ntrunk of their vehicle.\nYour honor, those are the facts as far as to the charges, and the state is\nrecommending in this case to [Applicant] that he have seven years\u2018\nprobation, a fine not to exceed $5,000. And even though there was\npossession of a firearm, there was a firearm, even though \u2013 as to those\ncharges, even though they are being nolle prossed, [Applicant] will waive\nany rights he has to a firearm as part of the plea offer.\nThe Court: Is part of the plea that he testify truthfully?\nProsecutor: I\u2019d like to ask him those questions now.\nThe Court: Has he been placed under oath?\nProsecutor: [Applicant], you\u2019ve already pled guilty to the charge of\nmarijuana, and it was your vehicle you were driving in; is that right?\n[Applicant]: No, it was Mr. H.\u2019s\nProsecutor: You were driving the vehicle, right?\n[Applicant]: Yes, sir.\nProsecutor: You knew there was marijuana in the cooler in the back of the\nvehicle, did you not?\n[Applicant]: Yes, sir.\nProsecutor: Did also Mr. H.?\n[Applicant]: Yes sir, he did.\n\nApplicant denied that the gun in the car belonged to him. At his sentencing, he acknowledged to the court\n10\nthat he was giving up a right to make any future claims that the gun was actually his. Given his denial of\nownership, it would be no problem for Applicant to give up this right. GE 6E, p. 3, 12. \n6\nProsecutor: Okay. Where did you get the marijuana?\n[Applicant]: The marijuana \u2013 I didn\u2019t get the marijuana, Mr. H. did.\nProsecutor: Mr. H. got the marijuana. Was it his idea?\n[Applicant]: Yes, it was.\nProsecutor: Did you see him put it in the cooler?\n[Applicant]: No, I didn\u2019t.\nProsecutor: But you knew it was back there inside the cooler?\n[Applicant]: Yes.\nProsecutor: Did he tell you he did it?\n[Applicant]: I knew it because I knew he did it. He had it in the cooler.\nProsecutor: Where were you transporting it to?\n[Applicant]: He was taking it to [city name].\nProsecutor: And you were going with him?\n[Applicant]: Yeah. I was going to pick up my brother and go back.\nProsecutor: You were going to share the proceeds?\n[Applicant]: No.\nGE 6.\nAfter this, the court found that Applicant\u2019s guilty plea was freely and voluntarily\nentered, that because of his plea, he could not own a firearm or be near a firearm, that\nApplicant waived his constitutional rights, and that he gave up his right to claim that Mr.\nH\u2019s firearm was actually Applicant\u2019s firearm.  The court said it would follow the\n10\nrecommendation of the state on the plea. Applicant testified to earning $350 to $400 a\nweek, to living with his parents, to paying for his daughter\u2019s day care, the light bill, and\nthe phone bill at home. He did not own a house or car, and he filed his 2003 taxes,\nwhich reflect an income of $15,000. On February 23, 2004, the court noted that it\n\nThe court did not inquire as to whether Applicant\u2019s knowledge of marijuana in the car related to the small\n11\namount of marijuana on his friend or the marijuana in the cooler. At the hearing on his plea, Applicant testified\nthat he did not observe Mr. H placing the marijuana in the cooler. GE 6.\nId. at p. 4, 12.\n12\n GE 3, p. 4; Tr. 16, 45-46.\n13\nGE 3.\n14\n7\nappreciated applicant\u2019s honesty and frankness, which the court stated was worth a lot.\nThe court also asked him if he knew when he got in the car he had marijuana and\nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d.  The court then fined him $3,500 and placed him on seven\n11\nyears of probation, which ended on February 23, 2011. The prosecutor nolle prossed\nthe remaining charges against Applicant. The court did not sentence him as a first\noffender, as Applicant\u2019s home state would not accept a first offender status probation,\nbut would accept an individual in probation status. The second arrest and sentencing\ndid not impact Applicant\u2019s probation for his arrest in 2000.12\nSince the day of his arrest in May 2003, Applicant has not seen or associated\nwith his casual friend, Mr. H. He may have seen him in court in 2003 or 2004, but\nApplicant is not sure. Applicant has not been involved with drugs or the police since\n2003. He works regularly and spends time with his family or playing music at his church.\nHe works for his father\u2019s business when needed, and when he is available.13\nWhen he completed his e-QIP, Applicant listed his two marijuana arrests and\nprobation as the action taken. He also stated that he did not know that the illegal drugs\nwere in the car when the police stopped the car for a traffic violation in 2003 as the car\nbelonged to his passenger (Mr. H), the owner of the car, who had not made him aware\nof the marijuana in the car. When he met with the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator, he reviewed the facts of his 2003 arrest. He outlined the\ncircumstances surrounding his arrest, which correlate with the facts previously\ndiscussed in this decision. He told the investigator that the car was searched by the\npolice, who found a gun. He denied any knowledge of the gun prior to its discovery. He\nacknowledged both he and Mr. H were arrested and taken into custody. He did not have\nany knowledge about the reasons for the release of Mr. H and the charges against Mr.\nH. He appeared at a court hearing the day after his arrest, where the court informed him\nthat he was being charged with possession of marijuana and stolen lottery tickets.\nApplicant advised the OPM investigator that he was shocked by the charges for\nmarijuana and stolen lottery tickets as he had no knowledge of these items being in the\ncar. He further advised that the police asked him to contact Mr. H, but that he did not\nhave any means to contact Mr. H. He described additional facts concerning what he\nknew about the discovery of the marijuana and lottery tickets and the results of his case.\nHe told the OPM investigator that he plead guilty to possession of marijuana and that\nthe remaining charges were dropped.14\n\nTr. 34-36. \n15\nId. at 36-39; GE 3.\n16\nGE 2; Tr. 39-42, 46-47. \n17\nTr. 49-66.\n18\n8\nOn cross-examination, Applicant admitted pleading guilty to possession with\nintent to distribute as a result of his 2003 arrest, understanding that he was not pleading\nguilty to simple possession, and answering the questions of the court truthfully. When\nDepartment Counsel reviewed his answers to the prosecutor\u2019s questions about his\nknowledge, Applicant again stated that at the time of the traffic stop, he did not know\nthere was marijuana in the car. He also admitted that he did not specifically say to the\ncourt that he learned about the marijuana in the holding cell. After Department Counsel\nread Applicant his answers to the court and pointed out to him that his court testimony\nsounded as if he had known the marijuana was in the car, Applicant stated \u201cnow I see\nwhat you\u2019re saying.\u201d He again stated that he did not know the marijuana was in the\ncooler until he and Mr. H talked in the holding cell.15\nConcerning his interview with the OPM investigator and his statement that he did\nnot know about the marijuana, Applicant testified, on cross-examination, that he was\nthinking about when the police stopped him and asked him if there was marijuana in the\ncar. He misunderstood the focus of the investigator\u2019s question, as he was thinking about\nwhen he was stopped. He did not know about the marijuana at the time of the stop, but\nhe did learn about it after the fact. He plead guilty to the charge based on his after the\nfact knowledge. Applicant affirmed that the statement of the investigator was correct.16\nIn his answer to interrogatories dated April 3, 2009, Applicant indicated that he\nlast possessed marijuana in August 2000, but that he plead guilty to a marijuana charge\nin 2003. At the hearing, Applicant explained that he answered in this format because he\nhad already plead guilty to the charge. Again, Applicant stated that he plead guilty to\nthis charge, but that he did not possess the marijuana that was in the car and that he\nwas denying responsibility for the underlying crime. He knew that Mr. H used marijuana,\nwhich was illegal, and that Mr. H sold marijuana. He knew about Mr. H\u2019s conduct\nbecause Mr. H told him. Mr. H never smoked marijuana in Applicant\u2019s presence, as Mr.\nH knew Applicant did not use marijuana. Mr. H never sold marijuana to Applicant.17\nApplicant\u2019s father, a church bishop, and a friend testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nBoth know about his criminal arrests in the past. Both consider Applicant trustworthy.\nHis friend described him as honest, dependable and reliable. Applicant is married and\ntakes responsibility for his family. He has proven himself to them through his conduct\nand behavior. Applicant told his friend that he was wrong in committing crimes with\ndrugs and has learned from his mistakes.   \n18\nApplicant deeply regrets his actions. His decision to purchase and sell marijuana\nin 2000 was out of character. He realized that his decision impacted others as well as\n\nGE 2; Tr. 16-17, 24.\n19\nUnder the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1, the Appeal Board is required to give deference to the credibility\n20\ndeterminations of an administrative judge. ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006)\n9\nhimself. He expressed regret for his actions and has taken steps to keep himself out of\ntrouble with the police since 2003. He spends time with his family and plays drums for\nhis church music group. He works hard.  Throughout the hearing, Applicant testified\n19\ncredibly about the facts of this case.20\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n10\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and the\nfollowing may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nIn 2000, Applicant flew 1,000 miles from his home with the specific intent to\npurchase marijuana for resale. The police arrested him and he plead guilty to\npossession of marijuana with intent to distribute charges in 2000. In 2003, the police\narrested and charged him with a number of criminal acts after a traffic stop. Applicant\nplead guilty to one count of possession of marijuana with the intent to sell. Based on its\nallegation of falsification, the Government provided substantial evidence for its\nallegation of falsification in SOR \u00b6 1.c. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31 (c) apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\n\n11\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s first arrest occurred more than 10 years ago, and his second and last\narrest occurred nearly eight years ago. Applicant has not been arrested by the police or\ninvolved with the police since 2003. He is married and spends his free time with his\nwife, daughter, and son. He has worked steadily since November 2005, not only at his\nfull-time job, but he also works part time for his father\u2019s construction business. He\nsupports his family and pays his bills. He plays drums for his church music group;\notherwise he focuses his time on work and family. He realizes the harm he caused\nhimself and his family by his past behavior. He deeply regrets his decision in 2000. He\nno longer associates with people involved in criminal activity or drugs. He never used\nmarijuana or any other illegal drug. Applicant has rehabilitated his past criminal conduct;\nthus he has mitigated the security concerns raised in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n32(a) and 32(b).\nGiven that I found that Applicant did not falsify his statement to the OPM\ninvestigator, SOR \u00b6 1.c is found in favor of Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(b) describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\ndeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical\nauthority, or other official government representative;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(b) to apply, Applicant\u2019s false or misleading information to the OPM\ninvestigator must be deliberate. Proof of a false statement, standing alone, does not\nestablish that it is deliberate. See ISCR Case No. 07\u201300196 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 09-07551 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2011) In evaluating whether the\nGovernment has presented substantial evidence regarding the deliberate nature of a\nfalse statement or an omission, the Judge must examine the statement or omission in\nlight of the record as a whole. Id. In making this determination, the administrative judge\nmust determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n21\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n12\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  When he met with\n21\nthe OPM investigator, Applicant denied the underlying conduct to which he plead guilty\nin court in February 2004. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR\nparagraph \u00b6 2.a. However, in his e-QIP, in his response to interrogatories, in his\nstatement to the investigator, and through his hearing testimony, he consistently stated\nthat he plead guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, but denied that\nhe actually possessed the marijuana with an intent to distribute at the time the police\nstopped Mr. H\u2019s vehicle for a traffic violation. He learned about the marijuana while in\nthe holding cell and because of this knowledge, he plead guilty to knowledge that the\nmarijuana was in the car. He denied at his court proceeding purchasing the marijuana\nor placing the marijuana in the cooler in the car. However, he made an ambiguious\nstatement during the providence inquiry about knowing the marijuana was in the\nvehicle\u2019s trunk.\nThe Appeal Board has generally held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel\napplies in DOHA proceedings. Under this doctrine, an applicant is precluded from\ncontending they did not engage in criminal acts for which they were convicted. See\nISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006) This concept is based upon the\npremise that an individual\u2019s right to administrative due process does not give him or her\nthe right to litigate a second time matters properly adjudicated in an earlier proceeding.\nId. In this case, Applicant plead guilty to possession of marijuana with the intent to\ndistribute, and the court found him guilty of this criminal act in 2004, which is a\nconclusive finding that cannot be relitigated in this case.\nIn deciding whether Applicant intentionally provided false or misleading\ninformation during his interview, I must look at his state of mind when he met with the\nOPM investigator. Applicant, who graduated from high school and has received\ntechnical training, is not a licensed lawyer. He does not have the education or skills to\nunderstand the nuances of law, which in this case, by pleading guilty in court, he\nacknowledged that he committed the underlying criminal acts. Id. Throughout his\nsecurity clearance process, Applicant readily and openly acknowledged that he was\narrested in 2000 and 2003; that he plead guilty in court in both cases; and that he\nreceived probation in both cases. He also accepted full responsibility for his criminal\nconduct and actions in 2000. While he admitted that he plead guilty to possession of\nmarijuana with intent to distribute in 2003, he consistently denied the actual conduct.\nWhen he completed his e-QIP and when he met with the OPM investigator, he denied\nany knowledge of the marijuana in the cooler at the time of his traffic stop and\nsubsequent arrest for driving on a suspended license. Applicant\u2019s statement to the\ninvestigator does not reflect that he was providing information based on his knowledge\nat the time of his arrest. Rather, he talks in general terms about his understanding of the\nevents which took place. He denied any knowledge of the drugs in the car, and he did\nnot mention learning about the drugs in the holding cell. Applicant also told the\ninvestigator that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the charges for possession of marijuana and\n\n13\nstolen lottery tickets. Given his statement that he learned about the marijuana while in\nthe holding cell, he did not provide truthful and accurate information to the OPM\ninvestigator about the circumstances surrounding his arrest in 2003.  The Government\nhas established its case under Guideline E.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following\nmitigating conditions are relevant in this case:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nAfter his arrest almost eight years, Applicant has changed his behavior and\nfriends. He stays away from individuals engaged in criminal activity, particularly\nindividuals who are involved with drugs. He focuses his energy on his family and his\nwork. For more than six years, he has worked successfully with the same company. In\nhis spare time, he plays drums at his church. He actively made a decision to stay away\nfrom his earlier acquaintances, which has changed the direction of his life. This decision\nshows maturity, good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(e) and 17(g)\napply. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n14\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. More than 10\nyears ago, Applicant made a bad decision when he decided to purchase a substantial\nquantity of marijuana to sell. When the police stopped him, he cooperated with their\nrequests to search his suitcases, knowing that drugs would be found during their\nsearch. He appeared in court less than two months after his arrest and pleaded guilty to\nthe criminal charges. He paid his fine. He recognized that his conduct was wrong and\nharmful to him and his family. Since this time, he has never purchased such large\nquantities of marijuana for any reason, including with the intent to sell.\nIn 2003, he accepted a ride with a casual friend to a cookout, not knowing the\nmajor problems which would result from this decision. A traffic stop resulted in new\ncriminal charges for a multitude of criminal offenses stemming from actions taken by his\nfriend. Recognizing the dilemma in which his decision placed him, Applicant relied upon\nthe advice of his attorney and plead guilty to one count of possession of marijuana with\nan intent to distribute. Since his sentencing in 2004, he has not been involved in drugs\nor any other criminal activity. He no longer associates with this friend. \nThroughout the security clearance process, Applicant has been honest and\nforthcoming about his two arrests and the results of these arrests. He has not made any\nattempt to hide his past criminal conduct, although he failed to be completely forthright\nwith the OPM investigator about all the facts surrounding his arrest and plea.\nApplicant focuses his time on his family and church. He works hard. He has held\nhis current job for more than five years, and he has worked part-time for his father for\nover 10 years. He learned from his past mistakes. As a result, he changed his behavior.\nHe is dependable and reliable. Most importantly, he recognizes that he made a serious\nmistake when he decided to purchase marijuana for resale in 2000 and when he chose\nMr. H as a friend. For the last eight years, he has worked hard to change his attitude\nand behavior with great success. He has no need to be involved with criminal activity or\npersons involved in criminal activity.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n15\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal and\ncriminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On May 19, 2010, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant, which detailed security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 4, 2010, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June\n22, 2010. This case was assigned to me on November 22, 2010.  DOHA issued a notice\nof hearing on December 2, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nDecember 22, 2010. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 10, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, also without objection. The record was left open at the\nApplicant\u2019s request for the submission of additional documentation. Applicant submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D on January 6, 2011. He submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E on January\n11, 2011. This exhibits were received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing on January 7, 2011.  The record closed on January 11, 2011. Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 47, single with a long-term companion, and has an Associate of\nScience degree. He is employed by a Defense contractor and seeks a security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. In his Answer to\nthe SOR, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 2.a., and 3.a. Those\nadmissions are deemed findings of fact. He denied allegations 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h.  He\nalso provided additional information supporting his request for a security clearance.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to obtain funds.\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation was brought about due to two circumstances. First,\nhe and his ex-wife, as part of the divorce decree, were supposed to alternate taking two\nof their three children as tax exemptions each year. The ex-wife violated this\nagreement, which caused Applicant to fall behind on his taxes. (Transcript at 37-39.)\nSecondly, in 2003, the company he was working for relocated to another state, and the\nApplicant was laid off. (Transcript at 53; Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13.) Applicant\nhas health issues, including dialysis three times a week. However, he is able to pay his\nmedical expenses.\nThe current status of the debts in the SOR is as follows:\n1.a.  Applicant is indebted to a bank for $1,082. He has made a payment\narrangement with this bank whereby he will pay this debt off in four months via direct\nwithdrawal. The first payment has been made. This debt is in relation to the automobile\ndescribed in 1.d., below. (Tr. 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 3, 5.) This debt is being\nresolved.\n1.b. Applicant admits that he had a tax lien with his state taxing authority.  His\nstate tax liability has been reduced $1,408 to $140.31. Applicant has always kept his\nstate taxing authority informed of his status. He is working with his tax preparer to\nresolve any lingering issues. (Tr. 37-45; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, and D at 8-12.) This debt\nis being resolved.\n\n3\n1.c. Applicant admits he was indebted to a creditor for $901. Applicant made a\npayment arrangement with this creditor which he successfully completed, pursuant to a\nletter from the creditor. (Tr. 47-49; Government Exhibit 10; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) This\ndebt is resolved.\n1.d. Applicant admits that he is indebted to a creditor for $19,797 for a\nrepossessed automobile. This automobile was returned to the bank in 2004 or 2005\nbecause Applicant could no longer afford the payments due to his layoff, described\nabove. Applicant\u2019s credible testimony was that he owed approximately $20,000 on this\nvehicle when it was returned. He further indicated the creditor indicated there would be\nan auction of the vehicle and Applicant would be responsible for any deficiency. He was\nnever notified of the auction, or that there was a deficiency. Applicant indicated that he\nwould pay any deficiency. (Tr. 49-56.) The status of this debt is unknown.\n1.e. This allegation originally stated that Applicant was indebted to the state\ngovernment for a tax lien. However, based on testimony and documentary evidence,\nApplicant and Department Counsel agreed that this was more likely to be a tax lien to\nthe Federal Government. The SOR was amended accordingly. (Transcript at 57-58.) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owed $7,624 to the Federal Government for\nback taxes. Applicant states that this lien should be substantially paid off because of the\nrefund he is due to receive for tax year 2009. He submitted his tax return showing that\nhe is due to receive a refund of $5,239. His tax preparer has contacted the IRS to\nrequest information concerning any additional deficiencies. (Tr. 37-45; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits B, and D at 3, 11.) This debt is being resolved.\n1.f. Applicant denied owing the Automobile Club $60 for a past due account.\nAfter the hearing, Applicant found out he owed $45 on his ex-wife\u2019s account. He paid\nthis debt. (Tr. 58-59; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 3-4.) This debt has been resolved.\n1.g. Applicant denied any knowledge of this medical debt in the amount of $99.\nBecause of his medical condition, Applicant has a lot of medical bills, but indicates that\nhe pays them consistently and conscientiously. (Transcript at 59-61.) His 2009 Federal\ntax return indicates that he had medical expenses of over $18,000. Under the Health\nInformation Privacy Act (HIPA) no specific medical creditor information is contained in\nhis March 2009 credit report. (Government Exhibit 5.) The most recent credit reports in\nthe record do not reflect the debt. (Government Exhibits 6, 7, 8 and 10.) The status of\nthis debt is unknown.\n1.h. Applicant denied owing a bank $100 for service fees. He submitted a\nstatement from the creditor indicating that the account was \u201csatisfied in full.\u201d (Tr. 63-65;\nApplicant Exhibit D at 6.) This debt has been resolved.\n1.i. Applicant denied owing $6,990 for homeowner\u2019s association fees on a time\nshare. Applicant testified that this time share is owned by his ex-wife. He quit-claimed\nthe property to her as a result of their divorce, but he was still obligated on the debt.\n\n4\nApplicant stated that a mistake on the deed kept him from being released from the\nliability. The Government\u2019s March 2009 credit report shows that this is a joint contractual\nliability. Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant contacted the property manager to\ndetermine the current status. (Tr. 66-70, 88-91; Applicant Exhibit E at 7-11.) The status\nof this debt is unknown.\n \nApplicant states that his current financial situation is stable. He is able to\nmaintain a budget, which includes payments for some of his past due debts. (Transcript\nat 70-72.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in Paragraph 2 that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he engaged in criminal conduct. It further alleges in Paragraph 3\nthat the criminal conduct also amounted as conduct that showed questionable\njudgment, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nApplicant was arrested in July 2005 for stealing printer cartridges from his then\nemployer. According to the Applicant, a then friend who was pastor of Applicant\u2019s\nchurch asked him to steal the cartridges so they could be used by the church. Applicant\nfreely admits that his conduct was foolish and he will never do anything like that again.\nHe has had no contact with this person since his arrest.\nAs a result of his arrest he went to court, plead guilty, and was sentenced to\nthree years probation, a term in jail, and to pay restitution. All terms of his sentence\nhave been fulfilled. In addition, Applicant was terminated from his employment due to\nthis transgression. (Transcript at 77-84, 92-93.) He has been completely forthcoming\nwith the Government concerning this incident. (Government Exhibits 1 and 3.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant is a highly respected person in his field. He presented\nrecommendations from members of his local community. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 13-\n20.) He also presented letters of recommendation from past and present co-workers.\nThe letters describe the Applicant as a person of \u201ccharacter,\u201d who displays a \u201chigh\ndegree of integrity, responsibility,\u201d and is \u201creliable and trustworthy.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nD at 21-32, and E at 4.) Applicant has also received on-the-job recognition and\nPerformance Awards at his current place of employment. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D at 33-\n43, and E at 5-7.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\n\n5\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own\ncommon sense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by the President in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant failed to pay several of his debts for a period of years.  The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d  As described above, the majority of the Applicant\u2019s debts occurred because\nof his divorce and loss of a job. His current financial situation is stable and the debt\nproblems are unlikely to occur. The evidence raises this mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d In addition, evidence that \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d is also mitigating under \u00b6\n20(d). Applicant\u2019s financial situation was exacerbated by his unemployment and divorce.\nHe has behaved responsibly, paying or resolving five debts, and substantially reducing\nhis tax liabilities. As set forth at length above, the Applicant has a legitimate dispute\nconcerning the debt in 1.i. Applicant is taking steps to resolve this debt with his ex-wife,\nand with the creditor. As the Appeal Board has stated concerning the successful\nmitigation of security concerns arising from financial considerations, \u201cAn applicant is not\nrequired to show that [he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has\nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to\nimplement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)). The evidence raises these\n\n7\nmitigating conditions as well. For all the foregoing reasons, Paragraph 1 is found for the\nApplicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)\nThe security concern for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant was involved in a serious case of theft from his employer. Under the\nCriminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are applicable.  AG \u00b6\n31.(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the following applicable\nMitigating Conditions under Criminal Conduct apply to this case. AG \u00b6 32.(a) states it\nmay be mitigating where, \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment.\u201d In addition, AG \u00b6 32.(d) states that it can be mitigating where, \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct happened almost six years ago. He admitted his guilt,\nhas paid restitution, and has a very good employment record since then. Applicant\nshowed sincere remorse and has successfully mitigated the security significance of this\nconduct. Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe Applicant\u2019s conduct set forth under Paragraph 2, and his being terminated\nfrom his employment because of his theft, brings into play disqualifying condition \u00b6 16(c)\nunder Guideline E: \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\n\n8\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\nThe following mitigating conditions under Guideline E \u00b6 17 apply to his conduct:\nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and\nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\nFor the same reasons that Applicant established mitigation under Paragraph 2,\ndiscussed above, he met his burden with respect to this paragraph as well. Based on\nhis testimony, and the available evidence, it is clear that his misconduct was singular in\nnature, and will not recur. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant stole from his employer in\n\n9\n2005. He was terminated from his job and prosecuted criminally for the offense. He has\npaid substantial financial restitution, fulfilled his sentence, and has not engaged in any\nsuch conduct since then. The actions took place almost six years ago and he has\nshown good judgment since then, and expresses not only extreme remorse, but a\ncredible intent not to engage in such conduct in the future.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was serious, but there is considerable evidence of\nrehabilitation.  Based on the state of the record, I find that there have been permanent\nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I find that\nthere is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and\nthat there is not a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct, personal conduct, and financial situation. On balance, I conclude that Applicant\nhas successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD\nsecurity clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a., and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 21-year-old general maintenance worker, who has worked for a defense contractor since October 2007. (GE 1, Tr. 15-17.) He seeks a security clearance. It is unclear whether Applicant requires a security clearance as a condition of his continued employment. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant graduated from high school in May 2007. He has not pursued any further education beyond high school, but hopes to pursue \u201cart school, something like that.\u201d (GE 1, Tr. 17-18.) Applicant has never married and has no dependents. (GE 1, Tr. 18.) Criminal Conduct Between January 2008 and March 2009, Applicant was arrested three times. On New Year\u2019s Day in January 2008, while accompanied by two friends, he was arrested for misdemeanor theft. He was detained by store security as he attempted to leave a department store wearing a coat that he had not paid for. He pled guilty to the charge and was sentenced to a $375 fine and six months in jail suspended, to be served if he failed to pay the fine.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 30, 2008, Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 5, 2010, and DOHA received his answer \non March 12, 2010. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 21, 2010. \nNovember 9, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe case was assigned to me on May 28, 2010. On June 2, 2010, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the case for June 22, 2010. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant did not offer any exhibits, but did testify on his \nown behalf. Applicant also called one witness, his father and work supervisor, to testify \non his behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 7, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a., and denied the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 21-year-old general maintenance worker, who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since October 2007. (GE 1, Tr. 15-17.) He seeks a security \nclearance. It is unclear whether Applicant requires a security clearance as a condition of \nhis continued employment. (Tr. 58-59.)  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 2007. He has not pursued any \nfurther education beyond high school, but hopes to pursue \u201cart school, something like \nthat.\u201d (GE 1, Tr. 17-18.) Applicant has never married and has no dependents. (GE 1, Tr. \n18.)  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nBetween January 2008 and March 2009, Applicant was arrested three times. On \nNew Year\u2019s Day in January 2008, while accompanied by two friends, he was arrested \nfor misdemeanor theft. He was detained by store security as he attempted to leave a \ndepartment store wearing a coat that he had not paid for. He pled guilty to the charge \nand was sentenced to a $375 fine and six months in jail suspended, to be served if he \nfailed to pay the fine. His explanation for his conduct was, \u201cI was just being young and \nstupid and for some reason thought to steal. It was a bad idea and I will never do it \nagain.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a., Response to SOR, GE 2, Tr. 19-23.) \n \nIn August 2008, Applicant was charged with two third-degree felony counts of \nthreat/use of a dangerous weapon in fight. Applicant was with several friends and stated \nthey were \u201cmak[ing] a little video about zombies taking over the world . . .[j]ust screwing \naround.\u201d Applicant and his friends then drove to a park and pointed a toy gun at people \nand \u201cscreamed and sung weird songs from Lady Gaga and stuff like that.\u201d While at the \npark, Applicant and his friends were confronted by a police officer and ceased their \nbehavior. However, Applicant was later summoned to the police station after a mother, \nwho was at the park, filed a complaint that she \u201cfeared for her life\u201d believing Applicant \nwas going to shoot her and her nine-year-old son. In October 2008, Applicant pled guilty \nto two misdemeanor charges of brandishing a weapon. On November 25, 2008, he was \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nsentenced to a $1,000 fine, 365 days in jail suspended for 365 days, 120 hours of \ncommunity service, and 24 months probation. (SOR \u00b6 1.b., Response to SOR, GE 2, \nGE 4, Tr. 23-32, 52-53.) \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant was charged with intoxication and disorderly conduct. \nHe consumed a large amount of alcohol with his girlfriend and another friend at his \napartment. His girlfriend and friend became concerned when he passed out and called \nthe police. When the police arrived, they found him unresponsive and in an unconscious \nstate. When they attempted to wake him, he spoke of committing suicide and became \ncombative and uncooperative and the police found it necessary restrain him. The \nparamedics transported him to the hospital where he received medical treatment. \nShortly after this arrest, Applicant was ordered to appear in court. He missed his first \ncourt date and a warrant was issued for his arrest. At some point after his intoxication \narrest, he was cited for a traffic violation and a second warrant was issued for his arrest \nfor failure to pay his traffic fine. In May 2010, Applicant was stopped for another traffic \noffense and the police discovered two outstanding arrest warrants. In May or June \n2010, Applicant went to court for all pending charges. He pled guilty to underage \ndrinking and the other charges were dropped. He was fined $375 and ordered to \nundergo a mental health evaluation. As of his hearing date, Applicant\u2019s mental health \nevaluation was pending. (SOR \u00b6 1.c., Response to SOR, GE 5, Tr. 35-51, 53-54, 56.) \n \nApplicant was 18 years old when he committed the first offense and 19 years old \nwhen he committed the second and third offenses. He testified he should receive a \nsecurity clearance \u201cbecause all those things . . . were kind of mistakes that I did that I \ndon\u2019t ever intend on doing again. And I\u2019m trustworthy, despite the fact that I did some \nreally stupid things. And I\u2019m working as hard as I can to try to get everything in order.\u201d \n(Tr. 51-52.) Applicant is living with his parents until he gets his life in order. (Tr. 55.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s father testified on his behalf. He is the site manager of Applicant\u2019s \nplace of employment and his direct supervisor. After Applicant turned 18, he \u201cwent hog-\nwild for awhile.\u201d He stated, \u201c[h]e\u2019s not a bad kid,\u201d adding that his son did not do anything \nout of malice and the things he did were \u201creally stupid stuff.\u201d Applicant currently lives \nwith his parents. His father testified that he and his wife are aware of Applicant\u2019s \nproblems and are doing everything they can to help him get through his current \ndifficulties. (Tr. 57-68.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6 31 list three potentially disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nThe Government established through, Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented, that AGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 30(c), and 31(d) apply. Additionally, and not alleged, two \narrest warrants were issued against Applicant following his third arrest.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s three skirmishes with the law \nall occurred between the ages of 18 and 19. It is clear from observing and listening to \nApplicant that his youth and immaturity were factors that led to him committing these \noffenses. Nonetheless, I cannot ignore the cumulative gravity of his conduct when \nconsidered as a whole. What perhaps started out as pranks later evolved into events \nwith serious consequences.  \n \nAt 18, Applicant was convicted of attempted shoplifting of a coat. At 19, he was \nconvicted of two separate offenses of brandishing a weapon and intoxication. Even \nthough the weapon was a toy gun, a mother and her young child were terrorized by the \nevent, believing the gun to be real. After his third arrest, he found himself facing two \nseparate arrest warrants. He remains on probation. His willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations at the present time falls short of what is expected of those \nentrusted with a security clearance.  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern involves three separate \ncriminal arrests or incidents that occurred when he was 18 and 19 years old. \n \nApplicant\u2019s desire to behave responsibly is noteworthy. Furthermore, his \ndisassociation from criminal activity and his gainful employment are significant steps \ntowards rehabilitating himself. He is receiving strong parental support and his desire to \nturn his behavior around is commendable.  \n \nHowever, on balance, the record evidence generates substantial doubts \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Further \ntime to establish a record of law abiding conduct and rehabilitation is needed. Applicant \nhas not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Drug involvement concerns are not mitigated because\nthere is an unacceptable risk of recurrence. Clearance is denied.\n                           \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 29, 2008. On August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline C, foreign\npreference, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a security\nclearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\nMay 7, 2010\n\n2\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 9, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing. On September 25, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. On November 6, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for December 10, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Two Government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) were\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript\n(Tr.) received on December 17, 2009. At Applicant\u2019s request, the record was kept open\nfor one week for him to submit documentary evidence. On December 11, 2009,\nApplicant timely submitted a statement of his intent to abstain from illegal drug use in\nthe future. Department Counsel did not object, and the document was admitted into\nevidence as Exhibit A.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant used\nmarijuana from about September 2001 to at least September 2008 (SOR 1.a). Under\nGuideline C, Applicant was alleged to have taken action to acquire Irish citizenship as a\nU.S. citizen (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations, which are incorporated as\nfactual findings. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old divorced father of five adult children. His career has\nbeen in manufacturing management. Since December 2006, he has been employed as\nthe director of operations for a defense contractor.

As his four sons grew and went to college, their social\nactivities began to include marijuana. Applicant smoked marijuana on occasion at family\ngatherings when it was offered to him to bond with his sons or nephews or both (\u201cI\u2019m not\ntrying to be the hip dad, I just want them to know that, you know, I understand some of\nthe things that they go through. . . .\u201d). (Tr. 47.) In the seven years preceding his\napplication for a security clearance filed in September 2008, Applicant smoked\nmarijuana on average three or four times a year, no more than 25 times. Applicant had\nbeen offered marijuana on other occasions and declined it. (Tr. 39.) Applicant did not\nseek out the marijuana. Nor did he possess it other than when it was passed to him.\n(Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 21, 34-38.) He does not remember the date of his last use, other than it\n\n3\nwas within the last two or three years. (Tr. 38-39, 42.) He understood that he was\nengaging in illegal activity when he smoked marijuana. (Tr. 42.)\nApplicant was not knowingly in the presence of someone smoking marijuana in\n2009. (Tr. 41.) As of December 2009, his 30-year-old son and his 24-year-old daughter\nwere still living with him. (Tr. 45.) Within the past two years, Applicant smelled\nmarijuana in his home, which led him to believe that one of his adult children had been\nsmoking it. He has not told them to cease their marijuana use because they are adults.\n(Tr. 47.) Applicant has informed his children that his security eligibility was being\nquestioned because of his occasional use of marijuana with them and that \u201cit\u2019s not a\ngood thing to be doing.\u201d (Tr. 44.) \nOn his e-QIP completed on September 29, 2008, Applicant disclosed that he\nused marijuana approximately 25 times from about September 2001 to \u201cPresent.\u201d (Ex.\n1.) On January 9, 2009, Applicant was interviewed, in part about his drug use. He told a\ngovernment investigator that his sons and nephews occasionally smoke marijuana for\nrecreational purposes. At family gatherings, or when they visit him, he has accepted\noffers from them to take a puff from one of their cigarettes. He obliged them in order to\nbond with his children and make them feel comfortable. Applicant indicated that he\nsmoked marijuana no more than three or four times a year, and that his previous\nestimate of 25 times was at the high end. He asserted that he would have no problem\ndiscontinuing this drug use for a security clearance. (Ex. 2.)\nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that if his clearance was denied, he could not\npromise that he would not use the drug again, but he does not see any future use as\nlikely, since marijuana is not important to him and he did not really care for it (\u201cI could\nprobably say almost with 95 percent surety that I probably wouldn\u2019t anyways [sic]\nbecause I don\u2019t care for it\u201d). (Tr. 39, 47-48). He testified that marijuana use was \u201cjust not\nthat big of a deal.\u201d (Tr. 40.) Applicant is willing to submit to a drug test to prove he can\nabstain from illegal drugs. (Tr. 43.) On December 11, 2009, Applicant executed a\nstatement of intent to never use drugs again, with the understanding that \u201cif [he is] ever\nfound to have again used marijuana then automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation for the use of marijuana would be imposed.\u201d (Ex. A.)\nForeign Preference\nIn about 2001 or 2002, Applicant and five of his seven siblings acquired Irish\ncitizenship, taking advantage of a limited opportunity under European Union rules\noffered to those of Irish heritage. Applicant\u2019s and his siblings\u2019 maternal grandparents\nwere natives of the Republic of Ireland. Expecting to work another 15 to 20 years,\nApplicant understood that acquisition of Irish citizenship would eliminate the need to\nacquire a work visa and facilitate travel should he become employed in Europe in the\nfuture. (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 21-23, 25, 32.) Applicant\u2019s sisters acquired the documents\nnecessary to prove Irish lineage through their maternal grandmother. After they\nsubmitted their applications and supporting documentation, they had to appear in\nperson at the Irish Consulate with evidence proving their identity and residency.\nApplicant does not believe that he had to declare any fidelity to Ireland to acquire Irish\n\n4\ncitizenship, but he does not recall for certain. (Tr. 28.) He has not taken any action to\nmaintain his Irish citizenship, and he does not know whether any such action is\nrequired. He has not communicated with the Irish Consulate since he acquired his\nforeign citizenship. (Tr. 48.)\nApplicant has never applied for an Irish passport or voted in an Irish election. He\nhas not applied for employment in Europe. He is willing to renounce his Irish citizenship,\nif required, to obtain a security clearance, but he would prefer to retain his dual\ncitizenship. His Irish citizenship has become a source of family pride for him. (Tr. 28-31,\n51.) His Irish citizenship has not affected his loyalty or allegiance to the United States.\n(Ex. 2, Tr. 23.)\nApplicant has no relatives who currently reside in Ireland. He first traveled to\nIreland on a one-week tour in June 2005 with his sons and their fiancees, before the\nmarriage of his oldest son. In May 2007, he spent about a week in Ireland. His brother\nwon a stay in a home in Ireland in a raffle, and Applicant accepted an invitation to\naccompany his brother and brother\u2019s family. (Ex. 1, Tr. 33-34.) \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\n\nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21\n1\nU.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance.\n5\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens),  and\n1\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant smoked marijuana once in college some 26 to 30 years ago. He tried it\nagain at a party in the mid to late 1990s. In about September 2001, he began to take\nhits off marijuana cigarettes passed to him by his sons or nephews. Despite knowing of\nits illegality, Applicant smoked marijuana to \u201cbond\u201d with these family members about\nthree or four times per year on average, as many as 25 times total, over the next seven\n\n6\nyears. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession,\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia,\u201d applies only in the limited sense that Applicant can be said to have\nhad physical custody or possession of the marijuana when he smoked it.\nDue to the occasional nature of his abuse, Applicant cannot now recall the last\ntime he smoked marijuana, other than it was within the last two or three years. AG \u00b6\n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is not particularly persuasive in mitigation,\ngiven the relative recency of his abuse, his age at the time, and his knowing disregard\nof its illegality. By joining his children in their marijuana use, he was implicitly condoning\ntheir illegal behavior as well.\nConcerning whether Applicant has demonstrated an intent to forego future drug\nabuse under AG \u00b6 26(b), AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused,\u201d do not apply. While it would be unrealistic to require Applicant to terminate his\nrelationships with his children, he could reasonably be expected under the\ncircumstances to inform his adult children not to use marijuana around him or in his\nhome. Within the past two years, he smelled marijuana in his home. He has not\nconfronted his children about their drug use because they are adults. It is possible, if not\nlikely, that family members will smoke marijuana in his residence in the future. There is\nno indication that any of Applicant\u2019s sons or nephews have ceased their involvement\nwith the drug, and Applicant used the drug in his home with them in the past.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant has used any marijuana since around\nSeptember 2008, if not before. See AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), (stating, \u201can appropriate period of\nabstinence\u201d). But his abstinence is reflective more of the random nature of his drug\ninvolvement than of an intent to abstain in the future. It was not until marijuana became\nan issue for his clearance that Applicant considered not using it in the future, and his\npromises to abstain have been motivated by, if not contingent on, him holding a security\nclearance. During his January 2009 interview, he indicated he would have no problem\ndiscontinuing his marijuana use for a security clearance. In his Answer to the SOR,\nApplicant indicated he was willing to attest to never using marijuana again. But he then\nadmitted at his hearing that he could not rule out future marijuana use if his clearance\nwas denied, although he also testified that he \u201cprobably\u201d would not use the drug again\nbecause it was \u201cjust not that big of a deal.\u201d (Tr. 40.) Before the record closed, he\nprovided the \u201csigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation\u201d required under AG \u00b6 26(b)(4). Applicant\u2019s willingness to abstain is credible, but\nit is not enough to overcome the drug involvement concerns. His failure to ask his\nchildren to abstain from drug use in his home raises considerable doubts about whether\nhe has a serious intent to obey the law, and it raises an unacceptable risk of a relapse.\nForeign Preference\nThe security concern about foreign preference is set out in AG \u00b6 9:\n\n7\nWhen an individual acts in such a way to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nA citizen of the United States from birth, Applicant voluntarily acquired Irish\ncitizenship through descent in 2001 or 2002, as a convenience if he should have  the\nopportunity to work in Europe in the future. He assumed he would not need a work visa,\nand it would facilitate travel in Europe. Applicant's status as a dual national is not\nnecessarily indicative of a foreign preference. See AG \u00b6 11(a) (stating, \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d), in this case\ngrandparents' birth, as mitigating of foreign preference concerns. But his voluntary\nacquisition of foreign citizenship as an adult raises significant foreign preference issues\nunder AG \u00b6 10(b), \u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen.\u201d\nHowever, there is also no evidence that Applicant has actively exercised a right,\nprivilege or obligation of his foreign citizenship that would fall within AG \u00b6 10(a). He has\nnever acquired an Irish passport. See AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) (stating, \u201cpossession of a current\nforeign passport\u201d). His two trips to Ireland, taken in 2005 and 2007, were on his U.S.\npassport. He has not performed any military service for Ireland. See AG \u00b6 10(a)(2)\n(stating, \u201cmilitary service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country\u201d). He has\nnot accepted any benefits from Ireland. As a dual citizen living in the United States, it is\nunclear whether he is eligible for any \u201ceducational, medical, retirement, social welfare,\nor other such benefits\u201d addressed in AG \u00b6 10(a)(3). He has never resided in Ireland, so\nAG \u00b6 10(a)(4), \u201cresidence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements,\u201d does\nnot apply. Although his initial motivation in obtaining Irish citizenship was to avoid\nhaving to acquire a work visa for employment in Europe, he is not currently \u201cusing\nforeign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country.\u201d See AG\n\u00b6 10(a)(5). Applicant has not sought or held a political office in Ireland, and he has not\nvoted in a foreign election, so AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(6) and 10(a)(7) are likewise not pertinent.\nApplicant expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship. He has taken no\nsteps toward that end, and admitted that he would prefer to retain his Irish citizenship.\nSo, while AG \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship,\u201d applies, it does not carry the same weight in mitigation as efforts to\nrenounce. That having been said, Applicant has not shown that he prefers Ireland to the\nUnited States. His Irish citizenship at this point is retained out of pride in his heritage\nand as a source of bragging rights over the two siblings who did not apply for Irish\ncitizenship. Having exercised no rights or obligations of his Irish citizenship in the past\nseven or eight years, Applicant is not likely to do so in the future. He has not inquired\nwhether he has to take any action to maintain his Irish citizenship, and indicated that he\nis not certain whether he is still an Irish citizen.\n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant displayed extremely poor judgment in using marijuana on repeated\noccasions with his sons and nephews. His drug use, while not frequent, is of concern\nbecause it was in knowing disregard of its illegality and he was of an age where he\ncould reasonably be expected to conform his behavior to the law. As of his hearing in\nDecember 2009, he could not rule out future use if his clearance was denied. He is\nwilling to abstain from marijuana use in order to obtain a security clearance, but he\nformulated this intent too recently to prove a demonstrated intent not to abuse\nmarijuana in the future. He has not told his children to stop their drug use, or to avoid\nusing it in his home.\nThe Unite States recognizes, but does not encourage, dual citizenship because\nof the obligations that may ensue to the foreign country. Although the process of\napplying for Irish citizenship took some effort on his part, for all practical purposes, he is\nan Irish citizen in name only. His clear preference is for the United States, where he has\nlived his entire life. His retention of his Irish citizenship is of little security concern\nprovided he does not actively exercise his Irish citizenship.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The record evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which occurred due to\nbusiness failures and unemployment. The business failures had a serious effect\nbecause both Applicant and her husband relied on the businesses for their income. The\nrecord evidence also shows that two debts are paid, two debts are in the process of\nsettlement, and payments on the mortgage loans are ongoing. Applicant is making a\ngood-faith effort, with the support of her parents-in-law, to resolve the delinquent debts.\nAccordingly, as explained below, this case is decided for Applicant.\nMarch 29, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Tr. 129. \n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on July 27, 2009,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether or not to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. She\nadmitted five of the six delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. The case was assigned to\nme October 2, 2009. The hearing took place November 17, 2009. The transcript (Tr.)\nwas received December 8, 2009. \nThe record was held open until December 18, 2009, to allow Applicant to present\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission and the post-\nhearing matters are admitted as Exhibit C.\n \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She is seeking to\nobtain an industrial security clearance for the first time. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree\nin finance in 2002. She has worked for her current employer since October 2006, and\nshe has since been promoted twice. Her current position is program assistant, and her\ncurrent annual salary is about $42,000.2\nApplicant married her husband in 2003, and they have a 20-month-old son.\nBefore her current employment, she and her husband both worked for her father-in-law\nin an enterprise consisting of three businesses; namely, a motorcycle dealership, an\napparel store associated with the dealership, and a gallery. She and her husband also\nobtained their licenses to sell real estate. When things were going well, Applicant and\nher husband earned reasonable incomes drawn from the businesses.

The dealership was sold at\na loss in 2006, and the other two businesses were closed during 2006 due to a decline\nin business attributable to economy. Applicant sought work and began her current job in\nOctober 2006. Her husband sought work as well, but with less success. He obtained a\njob with an aerospace firm in September 2007, but he was laid-off due to downsizing in\nMay 2008. He has been essentially unemployed but actively looking for a job since May\n2008. He reactivated his real estate license and affiliated with a real estate firm in\nJanuary 2009. So far, he has closed one transaction. His gross income since May 2008\nis less than $7,000.    \n4\nThe business failures caused serious financial problems for Applicant and her\nhusband, as reflected in documentary exhibits.  The SOR alleged six delinquent debts,\n5\nto include a past-due mortgage loan and a past-due loan for a second mortgage. The\ndebts are addressed below in sequence per the SOR. \nThe collection account for $1,029 in SOR \u00b6 1.a stems from a credit card account\nissued by an oil and gas company. It was turned over to a collection agency, which has\nagreed to settle the account for a lump-sum payment of $650 by December 8, 2009.6\nThe collection account for $582 in SOR \u00b6 1.b stems from a credit card account\nissued by a woman\u2019s clothing store. It was turned over to a collection agency, and\nApplicant paid or settled the account for $378 in August 2009.7\nThe collection account for $2,153 in SOR \u00b6 1.c stems from a credit card account\nissued by a clothing store. It was turned over to a collection agency, which has offered\nApplicant an option to settle the account for $1,885.8\nThe past-due accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e concern the first and second\nmortgages on Applicant\u2019s home. Applicant and her husband have entered into\nagreements to bring the mortgage loans current. Documentary information shows\nregular payments were made on both accounts during 2009.  \n9\n\n Exhibit 2. \n10\n Exhibit A, Attachment 4. \n11\n Exhibit C. \n12\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n13\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n15\n4\nApplicant denies responsibility for the $177 unpaid judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.f. This debt stems from a rental property owned by her father-in-law, but informally\nmanaged by her husband. The tenant obtained household services from a contractor,\nand the contractor billed Applicant and her husband. In 2007, the contractor sought\npayment by obtaining a small claims court judgment against Applicant and her\nhusband.  The matter was resolved in July 2009, when Applicant\u2019s father-in-law paid\n10\nthe contractor the amount in full.11\nApplicant and her husband completed credit counseling, which included\ndeveloping a written monthly budget.  The budget reveals Applicant and her husband\n12\nare living within their means with a small positive net remainder. The budget also\nreveals a sizeable amount of extra income ($4,315), and these monies are provided by\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law. Her mother-in-law lives with Applicant and her husband, and\nthe mother-in-law is able to assist with child care and other household matters while the\nfather-in-law works for another defense contractor at another location. The father-in-law\nis providing the financial support due to Applicant and her husband\u2019s  involvement with\nthe failed businesses, and the father-in-law intends to continue doing so until Applicant\nand her husband get back on their feet financially. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n13\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n14\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n15\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n22\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n5\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n16\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n17\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n18\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n19\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n20\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must\nbe a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material\ninformation, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person\nconcept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n23\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\n\n AG, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n24\n AG, \u00b6 18.  \n25\n AG, \u00b6 19(a).  \n26\n AG, \u00b6 19(c). \n27\n AG, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n28\n6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n24\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n25\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems or difficulties as shown by the findings of fact. Applicant and her\nhusband took the risk of not diversifying their sources of income. When the businesses\nfailed, they experienced serious financial problems that likely would have resulted in\nbankruptcy but for the assistance received from Applicant\u2019s in-laws. This history raises\nconcerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of\n26\nnot meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more\n27\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  The six conditions are as follows: \n28\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n\n7\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nHere, the most pertinent mitigating conditions are \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(d), and 20(e), and\neach is discussed below.\nFirst, \u00b6 20(a) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor because her financial problems\noccurred under circumstances unlikely to recur, as established by the business failures\nin 2006. The businesses have ceased operations and Applicant has had no involvement\nwith the businesses since then. She sought and obtained employment in a different\ncareer field, the defense industry, and has twice been promoted making it unlikely that\nshe will return to her previous business career.\nSecond, \u00b6 20(b) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor because her financial problems\noccurred due to circumstances largely beyond her control, as established by the\nbusiness failures in 2006. In addition, her husband\u2019s unemployment and\nunderemployment since 2006 are also circumstances largely beyond her control. She\nacted responsibly under the circumstances by finding employment in 2006, and taking\nmeasures to achieve financial stability as opposed to walking away from the financial\nobligations via bankruptcy. Applicant and her husband have likely had to swallow their\npride and give up some independence by relying her parents-in-law to get them through\nthis difficult time, but that is what responsible families do when facing difficult times.      \nThird, \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor as well. She made good-faith efforts to\nresolve the delinquent debts as shown in the findings of fact. The record evidence\nshows that two debts are paid, two debts are in the process of settlement, and\npayments on the mortgages are ongoing. \nFourth, \u00b6 20(e) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor for the unpaid judgment for $177,\nwhich is attributed to her father-in-law\u2019s rental property. And in any event, the judgment\nis now paid.\n\n AG, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n29\n8\nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history of\nfinancial problems or difficulties do not justify current doubts about her judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness in a security-clearance context. She presented sufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. In reaching this\nconclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.  In particular, I\n29\nconsidered the circumstances surrounding the financial problems (for example, the\nbusiness failures and her husband\u2019s lack of employment), and I also considered the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress and assess that potential as\nunlikely to remote in this case. Although Applicant did not present a perfect case in\nmitigation, she presented sufficient evidence to meet her ultimate burden of persuasion\nto obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f: \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.         \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Born in Lebanon in 1965 as a member of the Greek Orthodox church, Applicant was educated in Catholic schools. She eventually received a master\u2019s degree in finance in 1988 and became an administrator for a Lebanese export business. In the summer of 1991, she met her present husband. Her husband was also born in Lebanon, but had immigrated to the U.S. in 1986 and was now a dual U.S.-Lebanese citizen. By the end of 1992, Applicant had moved to the U.S. and the couple married. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1996 and obtained a U.S. passport in May 2006. Throughout her life, Applicant possessed and maintained a Lebanese passport. It was most recently renewed in August 2008 and was set to expire in 2013.

On\nAugust 21, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nIn her October 7, 2009, response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations\nraised under both guidelines and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on December 1, 2009. Department Counsel and\nApplicant agreed to a January 19, 2010, hearing date. A Notice of Hearing was issued\nby DOHA on December 16, 2009, setting the hearing for that date.\nApril 19, 2010\n\n Ex. 5, Administrative Notice, at 1.\n1\n Id. at 4.\n2\n Id., citing to U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 6 - Terrorist Organizations,\n3\ndated Apr. 30, 2009, at 1-2 and 13-14.In addition, several other similarly designated terrorist groups operate\nin Lebanon, such as Al-Aqsa Martyr\u2019s Brigade, Asbat Al-Ansar, Hamas, Popular Front for the Liberation of\nPalestine, and the Revolutionary People\u2019s Liberation Party.

Department Counsel submitted four\nexhibits (Ex.) which were accepted into the record as Exs. 1-4 without objection. A set\nof documents accompanied the government\u2019s request for administrative notice\nregarding the Republic of Lebanon. They were accepted without objection as Ex. 5.\nApplicant was represented by counsel and gave testimony. She submitted four\ndocuments, which were accepted into the record as Exs. A-D without objection.\nApplicant was given until February 4, 2010, to submit any additional documents. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on January 27, 2010. On January 29, 2010, three\nadditional documents were received from Applicant and accepted into the record as\nExs. E-G without objection. The record was closed on February 5, 2010. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance is denied.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government requested administrative notice of certain facts and materials\nregarding the Republic of Lebanon. Lebanon became independent in 1943. Since that\ntime, its history \u201chas been marked by periods of political turmoil interspersed with\nprosperity.\u201d  Although it is a parliamentary democracy, the effective exercise of political\n1\nrights was precluded during a civil war that raged from 1975 until 1991. Post-war\nreconstruction has been marked by political instability, economic uncertainty,\nassassination plots involving Lebanese officials, and clashes between Israeli military\nforces and Hizballah, a Shia Islamist political organization, which takes its ideological\ninspiration from the Iranian Revolution.  Hizballah was designated a \u201cForeign Terrorist\n2\nOrganization,\u201d and is described as  \u201cthe most technically capable terrorist group in the\nworld.\u201d  The Lebanese government recognizes Hizballah as a legitimate resistance\n3\ngroup.  Hizballah has elected representatives in both the Lebanese national assembly\n4\nand cabinet. It has been involved in numerous anti-United States and anti-Israeli\nterrorist attacks.  The United States (U.S.) remains \u201cextremely concerned about the role\n5\nHizballah is playing in Lebanon.\u201d  It conducts its own intelligence gathering within\n6\nLebanon, including surveillance cameras monitoring the Beirut airport.  \n7\n\n Ex. 5, Administrative Notice, supra, note 1, at 2.\n8\n Ex. 5, attachment, Country Reports, supra, note 7.\n9\n Ex. 5, Administrative Notice, supra, note 1, at 5.\n10\n Id.\n11\n Id at 7.\n12\n Id. at 6-7.\n13\n3\nSignificant human rights violations exist within Lebanon. Lebanese security\nforces have arbitrarily arrested and detained individuals, and detainees have\nexperienced torture and abuse.  Lebanese authorities \u201cfrequently interfered with the\n8\nprivacy of persons regarded as enemies of the government.\u201d  Not only Lebanese\n9\ncitizens are at risk. Americans have been the targets of terrorist attacks in Lebanon.10\nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that\nimpose special obligations on them.  The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to\n11\navoid travel to Lebanon due to safety and security concerns.  \nHizballah\u2019s intelligence-gathering activities extend beyond Lebanon\u2019s borders\nand into the U.S. In August 2005 and November 2007, individuals pled guilty to\nattempting to illegally export military equipment to Hizballah or agents in Lebanon\npurchasing equipment for Hizballah. In December 2008, a man pled guilty to illegally\nproviding material support to Hizballah by providing satellite transmission services to Al\nManar, Hizballah\u2019s Lebanon-based television station.  Other recent cases of\n12\nintelligence-gathering exist.13\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old chief executive officer of a consulting company. She\naccepted this position in October 2008 after a break from employment from October\n1991 until 2008. She is married and raising two teenage children.\nBorn in Lebanon in 1965 as a member of the Greek Orthodox church, Applicant\nwas educated in Catholic schools.

In August 2009, the SOR was issued, indicating the passport was an\n14\nissue. In November 2009, she inquired how she could relinquish it to Lebanese officials.\nShe was told that the Lebanese Consulate could cancel it within 24 hours.  After the\n15\nwinter holidays, Applicant personally surrendered her Lebanese passport to Lebanese\nauthorities, who cancelled it on January 22, 2010, without prejudice.  \n16\nOver the past decade, Applicant has attended one or more social functions each\nyear at a nearby Lebanese Consulate. She also took her children to the Consulate for\nplay dates with a former consular employee\u2019s children.  Despite these interactions, she\n17\nhas no interest in politics, never voted in a foreign election, and does not discuss\npolitics.18\nApplicant usually travels to Lebanon once or twice a year to visit her mother,\nfamily, and friends.  She often spends her summer trips to Lebanon at a modest beach\n19\nresidence acquired by her husband in lieu of a vacation retreat within the U.S. or\nelsewhere.  There, she and her children can enjoy summer by the sea and also visit\n20\nwith her mother and sisters.  Annual maintenance fees paid for the beach residence\n21\ncover any taxes owed on the property.  She and her husband maintain a nominal bank\n22\naccount in Lebanon, which currently has a balance of \u201cmaybe $3,000 dollars.\u201d  The\n23\naccount was recently established so the couple could access pocket money during their\nvisits without paying fees.24\n\n Although Applicant\u2019s father was a Lebanese citizen and entrepreneur, his diplomatic role was on behalf of\n25\na small nation. It had no apparent ties to the Lebanese government or a Lebanese political body.

She is financially affluent, having inherited money\nand real estate investments from her late husband, a successful businessman and\ndiplomat who passed away several years ago.  Applicant speaks with her mother on\n25\nthe telephone about every two to four weeks.  Her sister is young, single, and lives with\n26\ntheir mother. Applicant speaks with her sister if she is home when Applicant calls her\nmother. Applicant\u2019s elder sister is a Lebanese citizen residing in Jordan, where she\nteaches in a French school. Her husband, a citizen of Jordan, also teaches in a private\nschool. Applicant speaks with her elder sister by telephone about every three months.27\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has been in the U.S. for about 12\nyears and works in the finance sector. He is married and is expecting his first child. \nApplicant has a cousin who is an official serving the Lebanese government.  He\n28\nis pro-American and working for positive changes within Lebanon.  Because of his\n29\nbusy schedule, he and Applicant \u201cspeak like cousins . . . like calling and maybe saying\nMerry Christmas, like when I call my mother. . . but I didn\u2019t see him last summer. . . .\u201d30\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and sister-in-law are both U.S.-Lebanese citizens and\nresidents of Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s husband sometimes sends money to his mother.31\nBecause Lebanon does not offer state pensions, none of these relatives receive\ngovernment subsidies.32\nMost of Applicant\u2019s time is spent at work, where she earns about $480,000 a\nyear; her husband earns approximately $460,000 per year.  Their home is located in a\n33\nfashionable and exclusive section of a cosmopolitan U.S. city. Applicant\u2019s two children\n\n Tr. 45.\n34\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

In\n34\ntheir free time, the family enjoys sports, time at their club, and entertaining. Applicant\nfrequents school association meetings and attends a local church. She is content with\nher life as a U.S. citizen. Her financial and real estate connections to Lebanon are\nthrough her husband.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions, which are required in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.\nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must be and were considered in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching my\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence submitted. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on speculation\nor conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n35\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n36\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\n\n Id.\n37\n Id.\n38\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n39\n AG \u00b6 9.\n40\n AG \u00b6 10(a). \n41\n7\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n37\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n38\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n39\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Contacts) to be the most pertinent to the case.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C \u2013 Foreign Preference. \nThe concern regarding foreign preference is that when an individual acts in such\na way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the U.S.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\n40\ninclude exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  \n41\nThe SOR contains five allegations under this guideline. The first allegation\nconcerns Applicant\u2019s exercise of dual citizenship with Lebanon and the U.S. The\n\n The Government argued that the relinquishment and cancellation of Applicant\u2019s passport mitigated the\n42\npossession of Applicant\u2019s passport, \u201cbut not the past use and renewables.\u201d  Under the AG, possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport is a condition that \u201ccould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying,\u201d to the\nextent that it is an \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\u201d AG \u00b69\u2013\u00b610. Here, Applicant retained her\nLebanese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen and renewed it in 2008. W hen discovering it could pose a\nsecurity concern between late August and early October 2009, she consulted the Lebanese Consulate in\nNovember 2009, and had it cancelled in January 2010. AG \u00b611(e) a showing that the passport \u201chas been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated\u201d can mitigate security\nconcerns. I find that Applicant\u2019s actions meet this condition and adequately mitigate security concerns.  \n8\nremaining allegations concern her maintenance of a Lebanese passport. She admitted\nall allegations, sufficiently raising Foreign Preference Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6\n10(a) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming\na U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes, but is\nnot limited to (1) possession of a current foreign passport. . . ). With a foreign\npreference disqualifying condition raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate\nsecurity concerns.\nBefore becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996, Applicant emigrated from\nLebanon, the country of her birth. She maintained, but did not actively pursue or\nreaffirm, her Lebanese citizenship. It is solely and immutably based on both her birth in\nthat country and her parentage. Consequently, Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition\nAG \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry) applies. \nWhen Applicant received the SOR sometime between late August 2009 and\nearly October 2009, she learned that her Lebanese passport could pose security\nconcerns. After consultation with the Lebanese Consulate in November 2009, she\nsubmitted her Lebanese passport to the Consulate for cancellation. It was cancelled in\nJanuary 2010. Therefore, AG \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to\nthe cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) also applies.\nNot mentioned in the SOR are Applicant\u2019s access to a beach house in Lebanon,\npurchased by her husband, and a joint account in Lebanon which currently has a\nbalance of about $3,000. While these facts merit due consideration, they represent\nnominal interests in comparison to her highly lucrative employment, home, and\ncosmopolitan lifestyle in the U.S. Consequently, the allegations raised in the SOR\nremain as the primary concerns in this case. The basis for Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship\nwas credibly explained and her Lebanese passport was properly relinquished and\ncancelled.  She is fully \u201cAmericanized,\u201d enjoys a highly desirable lifestyle here in the\n42\nU.S., and evidences every intention of remaining a U.S. citizen. In weighing all these\nfactors, I find that there is no evidence that Applicant has a preference for Lebanon\nsuperior to her preference for her citizenship and life in the U.S. Foreign Preference\nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \n\n9\nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence\nThe concern under Guideline B is that foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. The adjudicator can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, are\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nThe country at issue is Lebanon. Post-civil war reconstruction has been marked\nby internal upheaval and the growing influence of Hizballah, an entity described by the\nU.S. State Department as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization\u201d and described as \u201cthe most\ntechnically capable terrorist group in the world.\u201d The Lebanese government recognized\nHizballah as a legitimate resistance group. Hizballah is represented within the country\u2019s\ngovernment. It is known to have been involved in anti-U.S. terrorist attacks. The U.S.\nremains \u201cextremely concerned about the role of Hizballah is playing in Lebanon.\u201d\nMoreover, Hizballah conducts its own intelligence gathering within Lebanon and has\nbeen tied to intelligence-gathering efforts within the U.S. \nSignificant human rights violations exist within Lebanon. Lebanese security\nforces arbitrarily arrest and detain individuals, detainees have experienced torture and\nabuse; Lebanese authorities frequently interfere with the privacy of its citizens.\nAmericans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon. Dual U.S.-\nLebanese citizens may be subject to laws that impose special obligations on them as\nLebanese citizens. The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to\nLebanon due to safety and security concerns. Because the country at issue is Lebanon,\nthe facts and allegations in this case demand heightened scrutiny. At issue are six\nadmitted allegations related to Lebanese relatives, most of whom reside in Lebanon,\nand activities Applicant and her children attended at a Lebanese Consulate. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and younger sister are citizens and residents of Lebanon.\nThey maintain regular telephonic contact and Applicant visits them once or twice a year.\nApplicant\u2019s eldest sister is a citizen of Lebanon who resides in Jordan. They maintain\nless frequent telephonic contact, but can visit when Applicant is on vacation in\nLebanon. Applicant maintains contact with a cousin, who is a noted Lebanese official.\nLittle evidence was presented with regard to her in-laws, but it may be assumed her\nhusband maintains some familial ties with his sister and mother, both of whom are dual\nU.S.-Lebanese citizens residing in Lebanon. Applicant also has social contact with\nemployees of a Lebanese Consulate in the U.S. and their children. Such facts are\nsufficient to give rise to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 7(a) (contact\n\n Although not raised in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s Lebanese beach residence and bank account could give rise\n43\nto AG \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\nor foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation). Given the comparative worth of those assets as compared to Applicant\u2019s U.S.-related income\nand holdings, however, they do not appear to be sufficiently \u201csubstantial\u201d to raise this disqualifying condition.\n10\nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and\nAG \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information).  With disqualifying conditions thus raised, the\n43\nburden shifts to Applicant to mitigate security concerns.\nApplicant has close family members who are citizens and residents of Lebanon,\nincluding an apparently affluent mother and a government official who is known to be\npro-American. She maintains contact and visits them when she can during her\nvacations there. Other relatives maintain Lebanese citizenship and either live in or visit\nLebanon. She developed social friendships with Lebanese Consulate officials, and their\nchildren shared play dates. Such facts must be considered in context. Lebanon has had\na rocky history for over 60 years. Plots to assassinate government officials are not\nuncommon. Furthermore, the current and growing influence of Hizbollah, a recognized\nterrorist organization with technical expertise and a record of gathering U.S.\nintelligence, is of tremendous concern to the U.S. Hizbollah has been known to target\nU.S. citizens and interests. Similarly, concerns exist regarding Lebanese officials\u2019\nhuman rights record and violations of privacy rights regarding its own citizens. Further,\nApplicant and her family regularly vacation in Lebanon despite U.S. State Department\nwarnings against the travel of U.S. citizens to that country. Given these facts, Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) does not apply. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s regular telephonic contact with and visits to Lebanon to see\nher mother and sisters, the women share an understandably familial bond. She shares\na similar bond with her cousin, a Lebanese official. She also befriended consular\nofficials and their children. Despite her clear loyalty to the U.S. and her substantial roots\nin the U.S., her familial bonds and her acquaintances with consular employees and\ntheir children are sufficiently significant to obviate application of AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty to or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest) and AG \u00b6 8(c)\n\n As noted, Applicant, herself,  has no substantial or significant financial or property interests in Lebanon that\n44\ncannot be resolved in favor of the U.S., especially in light of her U.S.-based holdings.\n11\n(contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation).  No other\nmitigating conditions apply.44\nForeign influence security concerns arise when foreign contacts may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in\na way that is not in U.S. interests. Scrutiny of such potential is heightened when the\ncountry is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information or is associated\nwith a risk of  terrorism. Lebanon raises such concerns. Here, Applicant has\nunderstandable bonds with family members living in Lebanon, including an affluent\nmother, a younger sister, and a cousin with a significant government position. She also\nsocializes with consular employees and their children. Such relationships can be\nmanipulated by Lebanese authorities or Hizbollah agents seeking either to harm\nAmericans or American interests, or gain sensitive information. Consequently, Foreign\nInfluence security concerns remain unmitigated.   \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) \u2013  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances \nsurrounding \nthe \nconduct, \nto \ninclude \nknowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible, affable, and mature individual who is also a highly\nsuccessful businesswoman. Since immigrating to the U.S. in 1992, she has achieved\nconsiderable professional, social, and financial success. At the same time, she has\nsuccessfully managed her parental and domestic duties. Her family spends summers\n\n12\ntogether abroad and share sports interests. There is no reason to doubt her loyalty to\nthe U.S., nor is there any doubt that she is deeply and happily entrenched in the life she\nhas built in the U.S. \nThe fact that she was born in Lebanon to Lebanese parents is immutable, and\ndual citizenship alone is not a bar to a security clearance. When advised that\nmaintenance of a Lebanese passport could prove to be an obstacle in acquiring such a\nclearance, she returned it to the Lebanese Consulate for cancellation. That act, as well\nas other considerations, led to her mitigation of foreign preference security concerns.\nSecurity concerns remain, however, with regard to foreign influence issues.\nDespite State Department warnings to the contrary, Applicant regularly vacations in\nLebanon. There, she maintains contact with her mother, sisters, and a cousin who is a\nnotable Lebanese governmental official. When in the U.S., she maintains varying\ndegrees of telephonic contact with these individuals. She also has cultivated friendships\nwith consular employees and their children. While such contact is understandable given\nher physical proximity to a local consulate and a shared heritage, these contacts only\ndeepen her ties with individuals having a significant nexus to Lebanon and,\nconsequently, may be vulnerable to anti-American interests based in that country. Such\nties sustain foreign influence security concerns. Clearance denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-2.f\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Australia from birth, who was\nraised and educated in Australia. Despite his continuous employment in the United\nStates since March 2001 and his marriage to a U.S. citizen in July 2005, he actively\nexercises his Australian citizenship by possessing and using an Australian passport to\nvisit his family in Australia. Clearance is denied.\n                           \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 18, 2008. On September 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\nMay 25, 2010\n\n2\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of\nDefense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 17, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing. On September 25, 2009, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. On November 6, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for December 10, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) were\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits (Ex. A-B) that\nwere also entered without objection, and he testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on December 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, that Applicant exercised\ndual citizenship by possessing an Australian passport issued in April 2007, that he\nobtained that passport despite possessing a U.S. passport issued in 2001, that he used\nhis Australian passport to travel to Australia, that he did not intend to relinquish it, and\nthat he intended to vote in Australian elections in order to maintain his Australian\ncitizenship (SOR 1.a). Applicant admitted the exercise of his Australian citizenship as\nalleged. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old senior project engineer, who has worked for his current\nemployer since August 2008. (Ex. 1.) He seeks a secret-level security clearance. (Ex. A,\nB.) He has never held a Department of Defense security clearance. (Ex. 1.)\nApplicant has dual citizenship with his native Australia and with the United States\nfrom birth. (Tr. 25.) He has held both Australian and U.S. passports since about age\ntwo. (Ex. 2.) His mother is a native Australian citizen. Applicant\u2019s father possesses\ncitizenship with his native United States, and with Australia, where he chose to make his\nhome. Applicant was raised in Australia (Tr. 25.) with his two sisters, who also possess\ndual citizenship with Australia and the United States. Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings\nreside in Australia. (Tr. 30.) His father is now retired from teaching, but his mother and\none sister are currently employed as educators. His other sister is a nurse at a hospital\nin Australia. (Ex. 1, 2.)\nIn December 2000, Applicant earned his B.S. degree in civil engineering from an\nAustralian university. He elected to begin his career as an engineer in the United States.\n(Ex. 1.) He wanted to see the United States, experience the culture, and connect with\nsome of his father\u2019s family here, so he responded to a U.S. firm\u2019s efforts to recruit\nAustralian engineering students. (Tr. 35-36.) In January 2001, he renewed his U.S.\npassport, which he used to enter the United States in March 2001. (Tr. 25.) Applicant\nworked for a succession of four employers in the private sector until August 2008, when\nhe started his present employment requiring a security clearance. (Ex. 1.)\n\n3\nAbout six months after he came to the United States, Applicant met his spouse,\nwho is a native U.S. citizen and not eligible at this point to become an Australian citizen.\n(Tr. 28, 36.) They married in the United States in July 2005, and their daughter was\nborn here in November 2006. On Applicant\u2019s application, his daughter was granted\nAustralian citizenship, so she has dual citizenship with the United States and Australia.\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 27.) In 2007, Applicant and his spouse purchased their current residence in\nthe United States. He and his spouse own two cars, and he has 401(k) accounts and\nbank accounts in the United States. (Tr. 38.) \nApplicant traveled to Australia to visit his parents and sisters about every other\nyear, including in August 2003, September 2005, June 2007, and April 2009. The trips\nin 2007 and 2009 were to attend his sisters\u2019 weddings. (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 32.) He entered\nand exited Australia on his Australian passport, which was last renewed in April 2007 for\nanother ten years. (Ex. 3, Tr. 30.) Applicant used his Australian passport because he is\nrequired to do so as an Australian citizen under Australian law. (Ex. 2, Tr. 30.) Applicant\nused his U.S. passport on reentry into the United States. (Ex. 2, Tr. 31.) Applicant\ntraveled to Europe in 2002. He believes he traveled on his U.S. passport because he\nwas not required to obtain a visa, although he is not certain. (Tr. 31.)\nOn September 18, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance. On his e-\nQIP, he disclosed his dual citizenship with the United States and Australia, his\npossession of valid passports with both countries, and his trips to Australia to see his\nfamily. (Ex. 1.) On December 19, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government\ninvestigator about his ties to Australia. Applicant indicated that he maintained his\nAustralian citizenship because his family still resides in Australia and he hoped to move\nback to Australia in the future. He asserted that his allegiance to Australia and the\nUnited States was equally divided, and that he harbored no ill feelings toward either\ncountry. Applicant indicated that he was required to vote in Australian elections in order\nto maintain his citizenship, so he intended to vote in future Australian elections. He\nstated that he would not be willing to renounce his Australian citizenship or relinquish\nhis Australian passport in order to obtain a security clearance. Applicant told the\ninvestigator that he held an Australian passport because it was required for him to travel\nto Australia as an Australian citizen, and it was more important to him to visit his family\nand be able to return to Australia to live in the future if he chose.  (Ex. 2.) \nApplicant voted in an Australian election in 2000, as Australian law requires all\nresident citizens of eligible age to vote or be subject to criminal penalties. He has not\nvoted in an Australian election since moving to the United States in March 2001. In\n2002 or 2003, Applicant applied for, and was granted, a waiver from the voting\nrequirement based on his status as a nonresident of Australia. (Tr. 25-26, 28-29.) He\ndoes not intend to vote in an Australian election as a nonresident. He testified that he\nlikely misunderstood the inquiry of the government investigator if he had indicated that\nhe was required to vote in an Australian election to maintain his Australian citizenship.\n(Tr. 34.)\nApplicant reads an Australian newspaper once or twice a week to \u201ccatch up on\nwhat\u2019s going on.\u201d (Tr. 40.) Applicant has no financial assets in Australia. He closed his\n\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings.\n1\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.\n12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and\nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative notice\nat ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein,\nADMINISTRATIVE LAW , Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative\nnotice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information from the internet. See, e.g.\nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents). In this case\nthe source for the facts is the U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Australia, Nov. 23, 2009,  which\nis available at http://www.state.gov.\n4\nbank accounts there \u201ca number of years ago.\u201d (Tr. 34, 41.) Should he reestablish\nresidency in Australia, he would be required to repay some of the costs of his  education\nin Australia through a tax on his earned income there. (Tr. 42.)\nApplicant registered to vote in the United States in late 2008. He had not voted in\nan election in the United States \u201cjust through pure laziness.\u201d (Tr. 34-35.) He pays taxes\nin the United States. (Tr. 35.) \nAs of December 2009, Applicant was not willing to relinquish his Australian\npassport (\u201cIt\u2019s the country I was born in, so I would like to hold onto that connection.\u201d).\nHe expects to return to Australia around Christmas 2011 to visit his family. (Tr. 32, 44-\n45.). Applicant has not checked into whether he could surrender his Australian passport\nand remain an Australian citizen. (Tr. 46.) He is aware that he would be required to\nobtain a visa to enter Australia on his U.S. passport, and would be limited in the length\nand number of times that he could visit. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant testified that while he\ngrew up in Australia, he always had a \u201cstrong connection\u201d to both the United States and\nAustralia because he had an American father and an Australian mother. He does not\nsee a reason to prefer one country over the other. (Tr. 33.) \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor is familiar with Applicant\u2019s work performance and\nwork ethic since July 2006. He served as Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor at their previous\nemployment. When this supervisor changed firms, he hired Applicant to work for him in\ntheir present employment. He has found Applicant to be hard-working, honest, and\nconscientious, and he recommends that Applicant be granted the secret-level security\nclearance that he needs to support engineering projects for the U.S. government. (Ex.\nB.) In the opinion of the company\u2019s senior vice president in charge of Applicant\u2019s\ndepartment, Applicant has become instrumental in supporting engineering projects at\nlocations throughout the world. (Ex. A.)\nI took administrative notice, sua sponte, of historical facts about Australia and its\nrelations to the United States.  Australia is a democracy with a parliamentary\n1\ngovernment. It is a founding member of the United Nations and respects the civil rights\nof its citizens. Shared democratic values, and similarities in cultural and historical\nbackground, have made relations between the United States and Australia\nexceptionally strong and close. Australian forces have fought beside the United States\nand other allies in every significant conflict since World War I. Australia was one of the\nearliest participants in Operation Enduring Freedom, and Australian troops are currently\n\n5\ndeployed in Afghanistan. Australia has an advanced market economy and is an active\ntrading partner of the United States. The United States and Australia share a wide\nrange of common interests and similar views on most international questions.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government\nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion when\nseeking to obtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\n6\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference\nThe security concern about foreign preference is set out in AG \u00b6 9:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Australia based on his birth in\nAustralia to a father with U.S. citizenship. His renewal, use, and ongoing possession of\nan active Australian passport after moving to the U.S. for employment in 2001 raises\nsignificant issues of foreign preference under AG \u00b6 10(a)(1), \u201cexercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(7), \u201cvoting in a foreign election,\u201d has limited\napplicability under the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s voting in an Australian election was\nan active exercise of his Australian citizenship when he also held U.S. citizenship. But\nfor all practical purposes, his U.S. citizenship was nominal before he came to the United\nStates in 2001, and he has not voted in an Australian election since 2000. Although\nApplicant had previously indicated that he intended to vote in an Australian election to\nmaintain his Australian citizenship, he clarified at his hearing that it was required only if\nhe resumed residency in Australia. He otherwise had no intent to vote in a foreign\nelection, and his application for a waiver from the voting requirement warrants a finding\nfor him as to SOR 1.a(5).\nDepartment Counsel argued for application of AG \u00b6 10(b), \u201caction to acquire or\nobtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen,\u201d based on Applicant\u2019s\nrenewal of his Australian passport. Because Applicant is an Australian native citizen\nwho held an Australian passport since he was two years old, his renewal of that\npassport is covered under AG \u00b6 10(a) rather than AG \u00b6 10(b). This is not a case where\nApplicant applied for a foreign citizenship as a U.S. citizen. Furthermore, while Applicant\nstated that he has equal allegiance to the United States and Australia, he has not made\nany statement or taken any action indicating that he does not have allegiance to the\nUnited States. To the contrary, he has chosen to reside here with his young family, and\npursue his career here. While he has not voted in a U.S. election, he pays taxes in the\nUnited States. Statements of equal allegiance fall short of establishing AG \u00b6 10(d), \u201cany\nstatement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States: for\nexample, declaration of intent to renounce United States citizenship; renunciation of\nUnited States citizenship.\u201d\nOf the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 11(a), \u201cdual citizenship is based\nsolely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country,\u201d applies because Applicant\nacquired Australian citizenship by birth. But AG \u00b6 11(a) does not mitigate the foreign\npreference concerns raised by his renewal and use of his Australian passport after he\nmoved to the United States. His choice to renew his foreign passport indicates\n\n7\npreference for his native Australia, even if his motivations were apolitical, i.e., to visit\nfamily without time limitations imposed on foreigners, to preserve his future options for\nresidency and employment, and to comply with the requirements of his Australian\ncitizenship. Applicant has taken no steps to obtain official U.S. approval for use of his\nAustralian passport, which is required under AG \u00b6 11(d), \u201cuse of a foreign passport is\napproved by the cognizant security authority.\u201d Whereas he continues to possess an\nAustralian passport that is valid until April 2017, and is likely to renew it, AG \u00b6 11(e),\n\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated,\u201d also does not apply.\nApplicant is not willing to renounce his Australian citizenship, so AG \u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d is not pertinent.\nWhile Applicant is not required to renounce his dual citizenship for access to classified\ninformation, his possession of a foreign passport raises unacceptable risks of foreign\ntravel unverifiable by the United States.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at\nAG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s foreign preference concerns relate to Australia, which\nhas a democratic government and is a close ally of the United States. He has\ncontinuously worked and resided in the United States since March 2001. He is married\nto a U.S. citizen, has a daughter born in the United States, and owns his home in the\nUnited States. At the same time, he has strong, emotional and familial ties to his native\nAustralia. He makes an effort to get caught up on what is happening in Australia by\nreading Australian newspapers on a regular basis. He obtained Australian citizenship for\nhis young daughter. He remains unwilling to surrender his Australian passport for a\nsecurity clearance. While it is understandable that he would want to retain ties to the\ncountry where he was born and raised, his failure to inquire about whether it would be\n\n8\npossible for him as a dual citizen to enter Australia on his U.S. passport is telling of a\npreference for Australia.\nBy all accounts, Applicant is a law-abiding citizen of good character. But he failed\nto carry his burden of mitigating the foreign preference security concerns. Even the best\nof allies do not always share the same interests, and Applicant has not persuaded me\nthat he can be counted on to make decisions free of any concern for his native\nAustralia.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a(1):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(2):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(3):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(4):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(5):\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The SOR, whic h\ndetailed the reasons for t\nhe action under the psychological c\nonditions and foreign\n                                                          \n1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as\namended (Directive). In addition, the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this\ncase. The AG were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006).\nThe AG replace the guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n 07/31/2012\n\n2 \n \ninfluence guidelines, recommended the case be submitted to an administrative judge for\na determination to revoke or deny Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.\nApplicant timely answered the SOR\nand requested a hearing.

At hearing, Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, as well as Hearing Exhibit\n(HE) 1, a demonstrative exhi\nbit detailing Applicant\u2019s\nforeign family members, were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A\nthrough J, which were also adm itted without objection. At A pplicant\u2019s request, I left the\nrecord open until April 30, 2012 t o allow him to submit a medical evaluation. He timely\nsubmitted the evaluation, which was admitted as AE K, without objection. I received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on April 10, 2012.\nRequest for Administrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts about Afghani stan and Pakistan. Without obj ection from A pplicant, I\napproved the request. The request and the a ttached documents have been included in\nthe record as HE 2. The pertinent facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old\nemployee of a federal c\nontractor who works as a\ntranslator and linguist. Born in Afghanistan, Applicant immigrated to the United States\nas a refugee in 1993, joining his parents and four brothers \u2013 two of whom also work as\ntranslators for federal contractors. Marri ed in December 2000 to an Afghan citizen who\nis a permanent resident of the United States, he is the father of five children between\nthe ages of 18 months and 10 years old.\nAll are U.S. citizens by birth. Applicant\u2019s\nparents-in-law are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. Ap plicant believes that his\nfather-in-law, now retired, served in the Afghanistan Nati onal Assembly; however, he\ndoes not know the details of his father-in-law\u2019s public service. Applicant speaks to his in-\nlaws by telephone twice each\nyear on holidays. Applicant\n\u2019s two sisters and their\nhusbands are residents and citizens of Pakistan. He speaks to his sisters, one of whom\nis a teacher, the other a housewife, ever\ny two months by telephone. Neither of\nApplicant\u2019s brothers-in-law works for the government.2\nBetween 1999 and 2008, Applic ant worked in the fast-food indus try, frequently\nchanging jobs to earn more money to support his growing family. In 2008, he obtained a\nposition as a translator supporting military operations overseas. While on assignment in\nFebruary 2010, Applicant was hospitalized for five days after exhibiting erratic behavior.\nThe details of the episode are unclear.\nIn one acc ount Applicant claim s he was\nhospitalized after being found as leep on the job; in another he claims that he suffered\nfrom stress issues and suic\nidal thoughts. After being re leased from the hospit al,\nApplicant voluntarily r esigned his position and was esco\nrted home by his employer.\nDuring the multi-day trip, Applicant continued to display erratic behavior. During the first\n                                                          \n2 Tr. 41, 45-49; GE 1, 9, 10.\n\n3 \n \nleg of the trip, Applic ant became unresponsive when he and his escort reached the\nsecurity check point. His escort had to physi cally move him through the security check\npoint. Applicant displayed a similar unrespo nsiveness during the second leg of the trip.\nHe refused to comply with the security pr\notocol at the airport. As Applicant became\nmore uncooperative, airport police and air\nline security were called to res\nolve the\nproblem. Eventually, law enforcement made the decision to take Applicant t o a medical\ncenter for diagnosis.3\nApplicant continued to resist the security officers, refusing to sit in the wheelchair\nwaiting to take him to the medic al center. Only after the threat of force did Applicant\nvoluntarily sit in the wheelch air. During transport, Applicant sprang from the chair and\nbegan to walk quickly through the terminal causing security to chase and restrain him.\nAfter being medicated and cleared for travel by the treating physician, Applicant and his\nescort resumed their travel to the United\nStates. The third leg of\nthe trip began with\nApplicant\u2019s continued refusal to cooperate with the air port security procedures, but he\nwas overpowered by\nhis escort and airport security. The escort struggled to ge\nt\nApplicant through the terminal and onto the pl ane because Applicant kept t rying to sit\ndown as t hey walked through the airport.\nOnce on the plane, the escort seated\nApplicant in the section of the plan reserved for them. After the plane took off, Applicant\nwent to sleep only waking to eat or use the restroom.4\nThree hours before landing in the United States, Appl icant awoke and resumed\nhis bizarre behavior. Every few minutes, A\npplicant would leave his seat, run to a\nwindow, open the shade, look out, close the shade, run back to his seat, and lay down.\nHe continued this pattern with quickening sp eed until the escort noti ced that the other\npassengers and the f light attendant were becoming alarmed. The escort managed to\nrestrain Applicant for a few minutes; how\never, Applicant resumed the behavior at a\nmore rapid rate. The escort explained to\nApplicant that his behavior could get him\ndetained by federal authorities. Applicant remained seated throughout the remainder of\nthe flight, but the escort struggled to keep Applicant in an upright position as the plane\nlanded.5\nDeplaned without incident, Applicant\u2019s erratic behavior resumed once he cleared\nimmigration. Applicant attempted to walk\npast the customs offi cer without completing\nthe process. He was able to move on afte\nr the esc ort intervened on his\nbehalf. At\nbaggage claim, Applicant tried to sit down on the baggage belt and then on the floor.\nWhen the escort went to inquire about their missing luggage, Applicant laid on the floor,\ndrawing the attention of airport security. Again, the escort defused the situation and took\nApplicant to a location where they could wa\nit for his family to pick him up. As they\nwaited in the terminal, Applicant again laid on the floor. When his brother-in-law came to\nretrieve him, Applicant became instantly alert and talkative. According to the escort, he\n                                                          \n3 Tr. 25, 35, 59-60; GE 1, 7, 9.\n4 GE 7.\n5 GE 7.\n\n4 \n \nwalked out of the air port as if nothing\nhad happened. Applicant does not recall any\ndetails of this trip.6\nUpon returning home, Applicant entered in tensive outpatient treatment at a local\nhospital. He was diagnosed by his treating p sychiatrist as having a psychotic disorder\nnot otherwise specified (NOS), major de\npressive order with psychotic features, and\npost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Appl icant received a similar diagnosis in 2006\nafter being hospitaliz ed for hearing voices\nand hav ing suicidal thoughts. Applicant\nreported being stressed about maintaining his family\u2019s financial stability. Applicant was\nprescribed anti-psychotic medications,\nwhich he s topped taking shortly after his\ndischarge.\nDuring his 2010 treatment, the\ntreating\npsychiatrist\nprescribed an\nantidepressant, which was the only medicat ion Applicant agreed to take at the time. He\nwas instructed to take one pill a day for\nsix months. He stopped taking the anti-\ndepressant in June 2010 and has refused to take any psychotropic medicines since.7\nAround the time Applicant decided to st op taking his prescribed anti-depres sant,\nhe interviewed for a position with his current\nemployer. Initially, Applicant was told that\nhe could not be hired for certain contracts if he was taking an ant i-depressant. He was\nhired by his current employer in August 2010.8\nBefore the issuance of the SOR, DO\nHA requested that Applic ant undergo a\npsychological evaluation. Although the evalua ting psychologist noted that at the time of\nthe evaluation Applicant appeared to be symp\ntom free, he did not make a specific\ndiagnosis. He concluded that Applicant\u2019s lack of insight in to his behavior and den ial of\nhis mental health iss ues may adversely a ffect Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. In response, Applic\nant obtained a second opinion from another\npsychologist, which was completed in April 2012. While this evaluation is also bereft of\na diagnosis, the evaluating psy\nchologist determined that Applic ant is not\ncurrently\ndisplaying any psychological dysfunction that could prevent him from resuming his work\nas a translator. However, given Applicant\u2019\ns apparent vulnerability to high levels o\nf\nstress, the psychologist observed that Applicant could return to his translator job under\ncircumstances that allow for adequate sleep, rest, and relaxation.9\nApplicant does not believ e that he has\never suffered from any mental health\nissues. He attributes his inc idents in 2006 and 2010 t o sleep deprivation. He testified\nthat while working abroad he\nwas nev er exposed to any\nevent that could hav\ne\nnegatively impacted his mental h ealth. He only complained of\nlong hours and lack\nof\nsleep.10\n                                                          \n6 Tr. 60 - 61; GE 7.\n7 Tr. 52-58; GE 6, 9.\n8 Tr. 66-69; GE 1.\n9 GE 8, AE K.\n10 Tr. 34-35, 52-55, 59-60, 71-75.\n\n5 \n \nAs the sole provider for his family, Applic ant is anxious to return to work. In the\nyear and a half he has been home, he has work\ned as a cashier at a fast food\nrestaurant. In 2011, he earned\n$17,000, down from the $21\n0,000 he earned as\na\ntranslator working overseas. Applicant is no t currently receiving medical treatment for\nhis mental health issues.11\n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is located in s outhwestern Asia. Pakistan borders it on the ea st and\nthe south. Iran borders it on the west and Russia on the nort h. Afghanistan is presently\nan Islamic Republic of 18 million people.\nThe country has exper ienced a turbulent\npolitical history, including an invasion by the Russians in 1979 and fighting among the\nvarious ethnic, clan and religious militias after the Russians withdrew from the country in\n1989. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of the country,\nimposing aggressive and repressive policies. In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition\npartners led military operations\nin the co untry, forcing the Taliban o ut of power b y\nNovember 2001. The new democ ratic government took power in 2004 after a popular\nelection. Despite that election, terrorists and the Taliban continue to assert power within\nthe country.12\nThe country\u2019s human rights record remains poor. Problems include: extrajudicial\nkillings; widespread official impunity; offici\nal corruption; and v iolence and societa l\ndiscrimination against women. Violence is rampant. According to recent reports from the\nU.S. Department o f State, insurgents continue to plan attacks and kidnappings of\nAmericans and other Western nat ionals. Travel warnings are ongoing. No section of\nAfghanistan is safe or immune from violence.13\n \nPakistan \nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic in Southwest Asia. It i s a low-income\ncountry, with a population t\nhat is 97 perc ent Muslim. After September 11, 2001,\nPakistan was one of only three countries\nto recognize the Taliban regime of\nAfghanistan. However, Pakistan reassessed it s relations with the Taliban and pledged\nsupport to the United States and the inter\nnational coalition in Operation Enduring\nFreedom, which aimed at remo\nving the Taliban from power\n. Despite this support,\nmembers of the Taliban are kn own to be in the Federally\nAdministered Tribal Area s\n(FATA) of Pakistan and in\nthe Balochistan Prov ince, which borders Iran and\nAfghanistan. The leaders of the Taliban operate openly in Pakistan. Extremists led by\nthe\nPakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Talib\nan\n\u201cTTP\u201d) commander and other Al-Qaida\nextremists have re-exerted their hold over\nareas in the FATA and the North West\nFrontier Province (NWFP). Taliban financing, wh ich crosses the border of Pakistan to\n                                                          \n11 Tr. 76-77; GE 9 \u2013 10.\n12 HE 2.\n13 HE 2.\n\n6 \n \nAfghanistan, has a llowed the insurgency in Afghanistan to strengt hen its military an d\ntechnical capabilities.\nThe security situation in Afghanistan worsened in 2008, including an increase in\nAl-Qaida\u2019s presence to levels unseen sinc\ne 2001-2002, driven in part by insurgent\naccess to safe havens in western Pakistan through the porous Afghan-Pakistan border.\nAlthough Al-Qaida\u2019s core organization in the tribal areas of Pakistan was under greater\npressure in 2009 than in 2008, it remained the most dangerous component of the larger\nAl-Qaida network. In early 2009, the FATA\nin Pak istan continued to provide vital\nsanctuary to Al-Qaida and a number of\nforeign and Pakistan-based extremist groups. \nAl-Qaida exploits the permissive operat\ning environment to support the Afghan\ninsurgency, while also planning attacks against the United States and Western interests\nin Pakistan and wor ldwide. Together with the Afghan Tali\nban and other extremist\ngroups, Al-Qaida uses this sanctuary to train and recruit operatives, plan and prepare\nregional and transnational attacks, disseminate propaganda, and obtain equipment and\nsupplies.\nThe Pakistani government has a poor\nhuman rights record. R eported human\nrights violations include extrajudicial killings, torture and rape by security forces, lack of\njudicial independence, arbitrary arrest,\nwidespread corruption, disappearance and\nimprisonment of political oppo nents, and trafficking in wo\nmen and children. As of\nFebruary\n2009, the government maintained\ndomestic\nintelligence services that\nmonitored political activists, suspected te rrorists, the media, and suspected foreign\nintelligence agents. The Department of State warns U.S. citizens of the risks of travel to\nPakistan in light of threats of terrorist acti vity. Since 2007, American citizens have been\nkidnapped for ransom or other\nreasons. Credible reports i\nndicated that authoritie s\nroutinely intercepted and opened mail without requisite court approval, and monitored\nmobile phones and electronic messages.14 \n \nPolicies \nWhen\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitabi\nlity\nfor a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must cons ider the adjudicative guidelines . In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluatin g an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines ar e not inflexible ru\nles of law. Instead,\nrecognizing the\ncomplexities\nof human behavior, adminis\ntrative\njudges apply the guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6 2( c), the entire process is a c onscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider a\nll\navailable, reliable information about the\nperson, past and pr esent, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\n                                                          \n14 HE 2.\n\n7 \n \nThe protection of the national sec urity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning pe\nrsonnel being cons idered for access to\nclassified information will be re solved in f avor of national secu rity.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only t hose conclusions that are re asonable, logical, and based\non the evidence.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3. 1.14, the Government must present evidence to es tablish\ncontroverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. Under Direc tive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant i s\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwit nesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applic\nant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks\naccess to classifi ed information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship\nwith the Government predi\ncated\nupon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust\nand confidence in indi viduals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applic\nant may deliberat ely or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions ent\nail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation\nof potential, ra\nther\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in\nno sense be a determination\nas to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3. 1(b) (listing multiple pr erequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set\nout in AG & 27:\nCertain emotional, mental and personality conditions can impair judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness. A fo\nrmal diagnosis of a disorde\nr is not\nrequired for there to be a conc ern under this guideline. A duly\nqualified\nmental health professional (e.g. clin\nical psychologist or ps\nychiatrist)\nemployed by or acceptable to and\napproved by the U.S. Government,\nshould\nbe consulted when evaluat\ning\npotentially disqualifying and\nmitigating\ninformation under this\nguideline.\nNo negative inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised on the basis of\nseeking mental health counseling.\n\n8 \n \nAll of the disqualifying conditions available under AG \u00b6 28 apply:\n(a) the behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but\nnot limited to emotionally\nunstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent,\nparanoid, or bizarre behavior;\n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified ment\nal health pr ofessional that the\nindividual has a condition not covered under any other guideline that may\nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and\n(c) the individual has failed t\no follow treatment advice relat ed to a\ndiagnosed emotional, mental, or personality condition, e.g., failure to take\nprescribed medication.\nApplicant experienced psychotic epi sodes in 2006 and 2010 that required\nhospitalization. During the latter event, wh\nich occurred while Ap plicant was working\noverseas, his behavior was so bizarre and erra tic, that his employer removed him from\nthe contract and sent him home. On bo\nth occasions, Applicant willingly entered\ntreatment, but Applic ant has refused to ta ke the pre scribed psychotropic drugs after\nbeing discharged. The psychologist who evaluat ed Applicant in connection with this\nsecurity clearance investigation concluded that Applic ant\u2019s inability to acknowledge his\nmental health issues may compromise his security worthiness.\nNone of the mitigating c\nonditions under the AG \u00b6\n29 apply. Applicant has\ndisplayed little ins ight into the source of\nhis mental health is\nsues. Based on the\navailable medical records, sleep deprivation, while a potentially aggravating factor, does\nnot appear to be the root cause of his psychological dysfunction. As is astutely noted by\nthe psychologist hired by Applic ant, he is ex tremely vulnerable to stress. However,\nApplicant has not pr ovided any evidence to show that\nhe is\nable to manage th\nis\nsignificant trigger. While both evaluating psy chologists are in agree ment that Applicant\nis not currently showing sympt oms of the previously diagnosed psychotic order, neither\nprovided any prognosis regarding\nApplicant\u2019s mental or emot ional stability. Becaus e\nApplicant is not currently receiving medic al treatment, there is no indicat ion that his\ncondition \u2013 while episodic \u2013 has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be ma nipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d15\n                                                          \n15 AG \u00b6 6.\n\n9 \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that are disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professiona\nl\nassociate, friend, or ot her person who is\na citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign per son, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the indi vidual\u2019s obligation to\nprotect sensitive infor mation or tec hnology and the individ ual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens of Afghanistan. He believes that his father-\nin-law, now retired, w as a member of the national assembly. His two sisters and their\nhusbands are citizens and residents of Pakistan.\nNone of his relatives in Pakistan are\nemployed by the gov ernment. The mere posse ssion of close ties with foreign family\nmembers is not, as a matter of law, dis\nqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an\napplicant has a close relationship with even one re lative living in a foreign c ountry, this\nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially\nresult in the compromise of classified information.\nThe nature of a nation\u2019s gov ernment, its relationship with the United States, and\nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coer cion or inducement. T he risk of coercion ,\npersuasion, or duress is signifi cantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian\ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government or\nthe country is known\nto conduct intellige nce collection operations agains t the United\nStates. However, this inquiry is not limited\nto countri es hostile to the United States.\nFriendly nations can have profound dis agreements with the United States over matters\nthey view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nThe relationship of Afghanistan and Paki stan with the United States places a\nsignificant, but not insurmountable burden of\npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate\nthat his relationships with his relatives livin g in those countries do not pose a security\nrisk. Applicant should not be placed in a position wher e he might be forced to choose\nbetween loyalty to the United States and a\ndesire to assist his\nrelatives living in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan who might be coerced\nby terrorists or other governmental\nentities in those countries. Wh ile there is no evi dence that intelligence o peratives or\nterrorists from Pakistan or\nAfghanistan seek or have sought classified or economic\ninformation from or through Applicant, or his rela tives, it is not possible to rule out such\na possibility in the future. Given the perilous conditions in these countries caused by the\noperation of the Taliban, te\nrrorist groups, the wide-spread corruption within both\ngovernments, and the countries\u2019 poor human rights records, a heightened risk exists.\n\n10 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:\n(a) the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or t\nhe positions or activities of those\npersons in that count ry are suc h that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choos e between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the in terests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, ei ther because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens\nis so casual and\ninfrequent that there is li ttle likelihood that it coul d create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nApplicant has lived in the United States for 19 year s and has established deep\nroots. He owns his home, and\nhis fiv e children are U.S. citizens. The majority of\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family, his wife, children, parents, and four of his six siblings,\nreside in the United St ates and live in the same community as Applicant. Conversely,\nApplicant has two immediate family members, two brothers-in-law, and his parents-in-\nlaw living in Pakistan and\nAfghanistan, respectively. Applicant does not maintain\nregular contact with them. Wh ile his contacts with his fo reign relatives cannot b e\nconsidered casual, they are infrequent. Viewed\nin totality, Applicant\u2019s connections to\nthe United States outweigh those to his foreign relativ es. As such, I find that he is not\nvulnerable to foreign exploi tation, inducement, manipulatio n, pressure, or coercion\nbecause of his foreign relations. As such, t hese relationships do not create a potential\nconflict of interest.\nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this ca se. In doing so, I have also considered\nthe whole-person concept and have doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified\ninformation.\nApplicant\u2019s\ndesire\nto return to his\nlucrative\ntranslator position\nis\nunderstandable; however, his untreated mental health i ssues pose an una cceptable\nsecurity risk. Having Applicant perform hi\ns translator duties in an environment that\nallows adequate sleep, rest, and relaxation does not mitigate the security risk. Applicant\nrefuses to acknowledge his mental health issues; in doing so, he also has not learned to\nmanage the conditions that tri gger his epis odic psychosis. Applicant\u2019s suffers fro m a\ncondition that, when exacerbat ed, impairs his judgment and reliab\nility and has the\npotential to compromise the security of those around him. Clearance is denied.\n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nAGAINST\nAPPLICANT\nSubparagr\naphs 1.a -1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR\nAPPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances present ed by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent wit h the natio nal interest to grant Applicant\neligibility for a securit y\nclearance.\nEligibility\nfor access to classified information\nis\ndenied.\n________________________\nNichole L.
