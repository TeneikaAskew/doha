He is 47 years old. \nHe married in 2000, divorced in 2004, remarried in 2006, and divorced in 2014. He has \nthree children--one adult and two minors. In his June 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA), he listed that he lived with his parents since May 2015. (Items 1, 2, 3, \n6) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1994. He earned an associate degree in \n2007 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012. He served honorably in the U.S. military on \nactive duty from July 1997 to July 2005 and February 2011 to December 2011. He \nserved honorably in the reserve from September 2005 to June 2006 and November \n2008 to February 2016. He worked as a firefighter for DOD from January 2008 to May \n2012. He was unemployed from June to August 2014. He worked overseas for previous \nDOD contractors from June 2006 to May 2008, May 2012 to June 2014, August to \nNovember 2014, and May 2015 to October 2019. As of his June 2020 SCA, he worked \nas a security officer for his employer, a DOD contractor, since April 2020. He also \nworked part time in a supermarket since October 2019. He has never held a security \nclearance. (Answer; Items 3, 6) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December \n2020, which was pending as of the date of the SOR (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that he \nhad three delinquent consumer debts totaling $70,939 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.d). In addition to \nhis admissions in his Answer, Applicant disclosed SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d on his \nSCA, and he discussed his delinquent debts during his September 2020 background \ninterview. The August 2020 credit bureau report lists SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. \nThe February 2021 credit bureau report lists Applicant\u2019s December 2020 bankruptcy \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also reflected that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were included in Applicant\u2019s \nDecember 2020 bankruptcy, carried a zero balance, and were closed accounts. It also \nreflected that Applicant did not have any outstanding delinquent debts. SOR \u00b6 1.d was \nnot reported on the 2021 credit bureau report. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to a lack of income from \nunderemployment when he was not employed overseas. In 2014, he resigned from \nemployment with a DOD contractor overseas when family issues affected his ability to \nwork. In 2019, he also resigned from employment overseas with a DOD contractor \nwhen he was unexpectedly not cleared to work after taking medical leave for a hernia \nrepair.

(Answer; Items \n2, 3, 6). \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a credit-card account past due in the approximate amount of \n$3,921, with a total balance of $24,343. Applicant stated in his SCA that he had \nobtained better employment and was trying to resolve this debt. He indicated in his \nbackground interview that he was communicating with the creditor in an attempt to \nmake payment arrangements for this debt. This debt was resolved through Applicant\u2019s \nDecember 2020 bankruptcy. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nSOR debt \u00b6 1.c is for a credit-card account past due in the approximate amount \nof $2,804, with a total balance of $23,182. Applicant indicated in his background \ninterview that he was communicating with the creditor in an attempt to make payment \narrangements. This debt was resolved through Applicant\u2019s December 2020 bankruptcy. \n(Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nSOR debt \u00b6 1.d. is for a credit-card account placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $23,414. Applicant stated in his SCA that he had not yet made \npayments on this debt because he was unsuccessful in his attempts with the creditor to \nlower his payment. He indicated in his background interview that he was communicating \nwith the creditor in an attempt to make payment arrangements. Although not reflected \nas such on his credit reports, this debt is resolved through Applicant\u2019s December 2020 \nbankruptcy. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant acknowledged in his background interview that his financial status \nneeded improvement and \u201che feels like he\u2019s in over his head.\u201d He indicated that he was \nnot able to make timely payments on his debts and he lacked the financial means to \nrepay his debts, but that he was willing to resolve them. He was intent on securing \nbetter employment, saving money, and reaching payment arrangements with his \ncreditors so that he could resolve his debts and avoid future financial problems. He had \nnot yet had any financial counseling. (Items 2, 3, 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. Applicant was unable to pay his debts. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant petitioned for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2020. The 2021 credit bureau report reflects that \ntwo of Applicant\u2019s three delinquent consumer debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, were \nincluded in his December 2020 bankruptcy, carried a zero balance, and that the \naccounts were closed. The 2021 credit bureau report also reflected that Applicant did \nnot have any outstanding delinquent debts. \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she \nneed only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were the result of conditions that were largely \nbeyond his control, and that he acted responsibly under the circumstances by resolving \nthem through bankruptcy. They do not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and goopd judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

The request and supporting documents were not admitted in evidence but \nare attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequest in part. \nI declined to take administrative notice of facts set out in HX I that are based on a \npublication from the Congressional Research Service. \u201cPronouncements about the \nrelationship between the United States and any given foreign country are committed to \nthe President of the United States and other duly authorized Executive Branch officials.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 02-00318 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004). The Congressional Research \nService provides research and analysis for Congress, not the Executive Branch. There is \nnothing in the record reflecting that the findings of fact and analysis by the Congressional \nResearch Service have been adopted by the Executive Branch. While publications of the \nCongressional Research Service may qualify as learned treatises, they are not \npronouncements from the Executive Branch and do not bind an administrative judge.  \nOn my own motion, and without objection from either party, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts recited in the U.S. Department of State Fact Sheet, \nBilateral Relations with Yemen, dated December 30, 2020, which can be found at \nwww.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-yemen.

His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old native of Yemen. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989 \nfrom a university in Yemen. He came to the United States in August 1983 under a cultural \nexchange scholarship and attended a U.S. university. (FORM Item 4 at 3.) He earned \nthree master\u2019s degrees and a doctorate from a U.S. university in 2005. \nApplicant married in 2000, divorced in 2006, and remarried in 2014. He became a \nU.S. citizen in 2011. His wife is a citizen of Yemen and a permanent resident of the United \nStates. (FORM Item 4, Subject Interview at 8.) He has two adult children from his first \nmarriage and a two-year-old daughter from his current marriage, who is a native-born \nU.S. citizen.

(FORM \nItem 3 at 19-26.) He is currently a self-employed freelance translator. \nApplicant applied for a security clearance in 2011, but his application was denied. \nDuring his counterintelligence-focused screening interview, he told the interviewer that he \nbelieved his application was denied because of money he sent to his brother and nephew \nin Yemen.

He provided no \nother information about his financial assets. \nI have taken administrative notice that the United States has had a long on-and-\noff relationship with Yemen, due to internal struggles for power in Yemen. The United \nStates established diplomatic representation in North Yemen in 1959 and in South Yemen \nin 1967. Military leaders in North Yemen overthrew the monarchy and established the \nYemen Arab Republic, which the United States recognized in 1962. The Yemen Arab \nRepublic severed relations with the United States in 1967 in the wake of the Arab-Israeli \nconflict. Diplomatic relations with the Yemen Arab Republic were reestablished in 1972. \nNorth Yemen and South Yemen temporarily reunified in 1990, and the United States \nestablished relations with the united country. \nA civil war broke out in 1994 over reunification issues. After reunification, Ali \nAbdullah Saleh, the former president of the Yemen Arab Republic, was elected president \nof the unified Yemen. President Saleh stepped down in early 2011, and Abdo Rabo \nMansour Hadi was elected president for a two-year transition period in February 2012, \nYemen\u2019s peaceful political transition ended in 2014, when the Houthis seized control of \nthe government and forced the established government into exile The country remains \ndeeply divided, with pockets of ongoing violent conflict. The Houthis continue to control much \nof the northwest, including Yemen\u2019s capital city, Sana\u2019a. Meanwhile, the legitimate Republic \nof Yemen Government (ROYG) re-established a presence in southern Yemen, including the \nport city of Aden. Amid rising tensions between the Houthis and ex-President Saleh, sporadic \nclashes erupted in mid-2017, and Houthi forces killed Saleh in early December 2017. \nBeginning in June 2018, ROYG forces, supported by their coalition partners, have sought to \nwrest control from Houthi forces occupying the port of Hudaydah on the Red Sea. Houthi \nforces have launched multiple rocket and ballistic missile attacks into the territory of the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and toward Red Sea shipping lanes, further increasing tensions in \nthe region. \nThe ongoing conflict has exacerbated already high levels of need in Yemen, pushing \nthe country to a humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that more than 24 million people, \nor nearly 80 percent of the entire population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, more \nthan any other single country today. The U.S. government provided more than $630 million \nin humanitarian assistance to Yemen in fiscal year 2020 and supports a small number of \nhealth, education, and recovery assistance activities to help households and social service \ndelivery systems cope with the effects of the conflict and prepare for the post-conflict \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecovery. However, the insecure operating environment and ongoing bureaucratic \nimpediments continue to limit development programming. \nYemen has significant human rights issues. Impunity of security officials is a \nproblem, in part because the government exercised limited authority and in part due to \nlack of effective mechanisms to investigate and prosecute abuse and corruption. The \nUnited States suspended diplomatic operations in Yemen in February 2015, and the U.S. \nAmbassador to Yemen maintains diplomatic engagement with Yemen from Riyadh, Saudi \nArabia. Yemen maintains an embassy in the United States. The U.S. State Department \nhas issued a Level 4 (Do not Travel) warning for Yemen, due to terrorism, civil unrest, \nhealth risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, and landmines. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n6 \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n\n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a \nState Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent \nto the Level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d).  \n\n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.

He has not rebutted \nthe presumption that he has ties of affection for or obligation to his mother-in-law and \nfather-in-law. \nApplicant has significant real estate holdings in Yemen and has monthly rental \nincome of about $1,000 to $1,500 from his rental properties in Yemen. The property \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g has been sold and no longer raises a security concern. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges the rental income from the properties alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and \n1.f. As such, it duplicates SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. When the same conduct is alleged twice in \nthe SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved \nin the applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) \n(same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.k for Applicant.  \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h-1.j are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. The civil unrest, terrorism, armed conflict, ineffective government, and poor \nhuman rights record in Yemen establish the heightened risk required to establish AG \u00b6 \n7(f). His SCA reflects that he owns his home in the United States, but he has not provided \nany other information about his assets in the United States. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n8 \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. The presence of Applicant\u2019s family members in \nYemen precludes a finding that Applicant is unlikely to be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of his family members and the interests of the United \nStates. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. Although Applicant has strong ties to the United \nStates, he also has strong ties to Yemen. Applicant has the burden of showing that his \nties to the United States are so strong that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. He has not met that burden. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s communications with his two stepmothers \nand his mother-in-law, with whom he has very little contact. It is not established for \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his two half-sisters and his brother. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not \ncasual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted \nthat presumption for his two half-sisters and his brother. \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is not established. The value of Applicant\u2019s property interests in Yemen \nis substantial. Although he owns a home in the United States, he has provided no \ninformation about his assets in the United States. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has significant ties to the United States. He has worked \nfor federal contractors, state government institutions, and private employers for many \nyears, apparently without incident. \nHowever, he has maintained strong family and financial connections with Yemen. \nDuring his counterintelligence screening interview, he acknowledged that his financial \nconnections to Yemen probably kept him from obtaining a clearance in 2011, but he has \nmaintained those connections, and he submitted no evidence of efforts to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by them. \u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nmaintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, \n2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 \nU.S. 905 (1991). \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis family and financial connections to Yemen. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f and 1.h-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. 14-16, 22; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), \ndepression, and anxiety. He sees mental health professionals. Applicant explained that \nin 2015, he began having PTSD symptoms. He received therapy and medication through \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). After months of trying different medications, he \ndecided in November 2016 to use marijuana to help him because the prescribed \nmedications were not helping him. He purchased it from unknown street vendors. (Tr. 19\u00ad\n25, 33-34) \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in April 2020, \nhe did not disclose his marijuana use. He explained that he rushed to complete the SCA. \nHe was using marijuana at the time he completed it. He stated it did not register with him \nto stop using marijuana, despite the question on the SCA asking about his drug use. He \nsaid he did not stop using marijuana at that time and did not take into consideration his \njob. He stopped using it when he found medication that worked. He explained that his \nmental health trumped all other considerations. (Tr. 26-27, 36) \nIn June 2020, during Applicant\u2019s background interview with a government \ninvestigator, he was asked by the investigator about his use of illegal drugs and he \ndisclosed his marijuana use.

The thought of losing his security clearance never \ncrossed his mind when he used marijuana. (Tr. 25-28) \nApplicant believes he is on a better medication now and does not need to use \nmarijuana. He testified that he stopped using marijuana in December 2020. Because his \nmedication is working, he does not feel the need to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 19, \n27-28, 35) \nApplicant testified that marijuana is a natural supplement and is legal in many \nstates. He stated that it does not alter his performance. If he believed its use would alter \nhis performance, he would not use it. He used it for his mental health. His psychiatrist and \ntherapist were aware he was using marijuana. They did not recommend its use and were \nconcerned because they could not manage it. He would use it at night to aid him in getting \nto sleep. He estimated he used it less than once a week. He testified he used marijuana \nfor several years before he found medication that worked. He said if his medication \nstopped working, he would not resume using marijuana. He now has an appreciation that \nmarijuana use is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He had been seeing his \nmental health professionals about once a month, but now sees them about every three \nmonths. Applicant provided copies of prescriptions he takes for depression and anxiety. \nHe also provided copies of some of his medical records. (Tr. 26-33; AE A-I) \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - $13,795; 1.b \u2013 $2,050) that were \ncharged off. Applicant testified that a few years ago he had some collection accounts, but \nthey are now resolved. He provided documentary evidence that both debts have been \nresolved. (Tr. 16, GE 2; AE J, K, L) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had two delinquent debts that were charged off. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20 is potentially \napplicable: \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant resolved the delinquent accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b and provided \ndocumentary proof. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacturing, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from November 2016 to December 2020 with varying \nfrequency. He purchased and used marijuana during this same time period and while \nholding a security clearance. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was suffering from PTSD and was being \ntreated by mental health professionals. He felt the medications prescribed were \nineffective, so he decided to purchase and use marijuana for over four years while holding \na security clearance. Applicant\u2019s main focus was on treating his mental health, which is \nunderstandable. However, his failure to recognize and act responsibly regarding his use \nof marijuana is a concern. He did not consider that using marijuana, an illegal substance, \nand without the approval of his mental health professionals, was a security concern. He \nused it after completing his April 2020 SCA and after he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator in June 2020. He testified he stopped using marijuana in December 2020 \nwhen new medication he was prescribed helped. \nI have considered the impact PTSD has had on Applicant\u2019s life and his attempt to \nresolve his mental health issues. However, I cannot ignore that he failed to consider that \nhis use of marijuana while holding a security clearance was a serious concern. He \npurchased it from an unknown source, which is also a concern. He used it contrary to his \ndoctor\u2019s recommendations. Although he testified that he would not use it again and has \nnot used it since December 2020, I am not convinced that if his medication became \nineffective, he would not resume its use. His years of purchasing and using marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. I find the above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered that Applicant is a veteran who suffers from PTSD. Applicant \nwas being treated by mental health professionals for it. He was dissatisfied with the \nmedication he was prescribed and decided to use marijuana. He used it for over four \nyears while holding a security clearance and testified that his mental health trumped all \nother considerations. He did not consider the impact his marijuana use would have on his \nsecurity clearance. He has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, but failed to mitigate the security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 27) He had a three-year \nfollow-on assignment as an instructor pilot, and being continuously alert was paramount \nbecause there was some risk involved as trainee pilots sometimes make dangerous \nmistakes. (Tr. 28) \nPsychological Conditions  \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege Applicant received inpatient care in a military \nmental-health facility in August 2014, August 2015, and October 2015, following bipolar \nepisodes. \nIn 2014, Applicant volunteered to be a pilot for a highly specialized aircraft that \ncosts the government more than $300 million. (Tr. 29) He had trouble sleeping; his Air \nForce duties were stressful; and there was a new baby in his home. (Tr. 31, 47, 88) He \nwent to a flight surgeon on a Friday, and he received a prescription for Restoril. (Tr. 31-\n32, 47) He took the medication over the weekend. (Tr. 47) On Monday, he went back to \nthe doctor, and the doctor noticed Applicant\u2019s speech was odd. (Tr. 48) He was referred \nto a psychiatrist in the same clinic, who observed his comments were nonsensical. (Tr. \n48) He received a referral to a military mental-health facility. (Tr. 32, 48) However, \nApplicant thought he was going to the hospital for a sleep study. (Tr. 89, 94) In August \n2014, he was an inpatient at a military mental-health facility for seven days, and he was \ndiagnosed with Bipolar disorder. (Tr. 32) He received two weeks of outpatient follow-up \nappointments. (Tr. 89) Applicant believed he had stress-related trouble sleeping, and he \ndisagreed with the Bipolar disorder diagnosis. (Tr. 32, 49, 55) He was extremely worried \nthat his lifetime dream of continuing his career as an Air Force pilot of high performance \naircraft was in jeopardy due to the Bipolar diagnosis. (Tr. 49) \nOn September 5, 2014, a psychiatrist, Major B, prescribed 1,000 milligrams of \nDepakote a day, which is a mood stabilizer. (GE 3) On September 15, 2014, Major B \nincreased the dosage to 1,500 milligrams a day. (Tr. 53; GE 3) Applicant took the \nprescribed medications. (Tr. 53) In October 2014, Major B said Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of \nBipolar I disorder, and use of psychoactive medication made him unfit for continued Air \nForce duty. (Tr. 56) Applicant was concerned about the diagnosis, and in November \n2014, he started seeing a flight doctor, Colonel S, who was Major B\u2019s supervisor. (Tr. 53) \nColonel S was Applicant\u2019s friend, and he was also a pilot, and a psychiatrist. (Tr. 33, 90) \nColonel S suggested the Bipolar diagnosis might be incorrect. (Tr. 55) Colonel S gave \nApplicant false hope that he might not have Bipolar disorder. (Tr. 89) Colonel S continued \nthe Depakote; however, he reduced the dosage. (Tr. 58) Colonel S wanted to carefully \nobserve Applicant\u2019s reaction to the reduced dosage. (Tr. 59) In January 2015, Applicant \nstopped taking the medication completely. (Tr. 60) Applicant continued to believe the \nAugust 2014 episode was an isolated event, and he could continue his Air Force career. \n(Tr. 90) \nAt Applicant\u2019s June 2015 medical board, Colonel S conceded he was unsure \nabout Applicant\u2019s diagnosis.

(Tr. 63, 96) His parents did not reveal her Bipolar diagnosis \nbecause his symptoms were not similar to her symptoms. (Tr. 110) He did not \nimmediately disclose his mother\u2019s Bipolar diagnosis to his treating psychiatrist because \nhe was unsure whether it was relevant to his own diagnosis, which he continued to \nbelieve was not Bipolar disease. (Tr. 63) In August 2015, Applicant had been off \nmedication for 10 months, or he may have recently restarted taking medications. (Tr. 62, \n64, 95-96) He was having trouble sleeping, and he had manic-like symptoms that he was \na genius, and he was having an epiphany. (Tr. 34, 64) His father took him to see Colonel \nS. (Tr. 63, 91, 109) Colonel S decided, and Applicant and his father agreed, that he had \nBipolar disorder. (Tr. 34) In August 2015, he was an inpatient at a military mental-health \nfacility for seven days. (Tr. 34) \nIn October 2015, Applicant was upset about the loss of his Air Force career, and \nduring an Air Force weigh in, he slammed and kicked a door and started yelling that he \nneeded an ambulance and wanted to \u201ccheck in.\u201d (Tr. 35-36) The military police came into \nthe area, tackled Applicant, and used a Taser on him. (Tr. 36) Mental-health personnel \nconcluded he was under medicated in October 2015. (Tr. 36) In October 2015, he spent \na week as an inpatient in a military mental-health facility, and then he was medically \nretired at a 50 percent level from the Air Force as a captain. (Tr. 37, 80) He is eligible for \nmilitary medical care as a retiree. (Tr. 80) The October 2015 episode removed all doubt \nfrom Applicant, his spouse, and his parents about the accuracy of his Bipolar disorder \ndiagnosis. (Tr. 34, 62, 91, 107, 109) He continued seeing Dr. S until he left the Air Force. \n(Tr. 67) He said he was completely compliant with medical directions after December \n2015. (Tr. 64) \nWhen Applicant learned he was being medically retired from the Air Force, he \ncalled the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a mental-health appointment. (Tr. 67) \nHe received a 90 percent disability rating from the VA with 70 percent for Bipolar disorder \nand 20 percent for other disabilities. (Tr. 37; AE A) The Federal Aviation Administration \nrevoked his private pilot\u2019s license. (Tr. 80-81) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant has received treatment for Bipolar disorder from the \nVA since August 2014. However, his VA treatment began in December 2015, and \nApplicant has subsequently received mental-health care from the VA. (Tr. 39) He sees a \npsychiatrist every 90 days and a counselor or psychologist every 30 days. (Tr. 39, 72) \nHe is also able to seek assistance on an as needed basis. (Tr. 98) Applicant\u2019s spouse is \na nurse, and she is watchful for any symptoms of Bipolar disorder or the beginnings of \nany manic episodes. (Tr. 34, 39, 85) He has not received inpatient treatment since \nOctober 2015. (Tr. 40) He takes his medication every night at 9:00 pm.

The \ndiscrepant information you continue to provide, and in the absence of \nmedical oversight, what may otherwise be minor concerns about your \njudgment and trustworthiness are more significant. \nApplicant disagreed with Dr. H\u2019s comment that he has an \u201congoing pattern to \nattempt to conceal the truth and minimize your condition.\u201d (Tr. 42) Dr. H said Applicant \nomitted or minimized the following details: \u201cHis mother\u2019s history of Bipolar Disorder, the \nextent of his sleep deficits, and his history of amphetamine use were relevant details he \ndid not share openly with his physician. It is clear [Applicant] was motivated to conceal \nthese facts when he contested his diagnosis.\u201d (GE 2 at 11) According to Dr. H\u2019s report, \nthe use of amphetamines was not disclosed in his background information or \nacknowledged on the objective Psychological Screening Inventory (PSI). (GE 2 at 5) \nHowever, Dr. H\u2019s report states, \u201cunstructured interview revealed tandem use of \nstimulants and Ambient to manage extremely long flight duty when he was in the Air \nForce. While he initially drank Red Bull, he was later given Dexedrine or other forms of \namphetamine for long missions and Ambien to rest between flights.\u201d Id. Applicant may \nnot have recognized that the PSI was seeking any amphetamine use and not \namphetamine use not prescribed by medical personnel. \nDr. H believed Applicant answered some questions in the PSI with excessively \npositive responses. GE 2 at 5 At his hearing, he described himself as an optimistic \nperson, and he believed while his condition is serious and challenging, with the excellent \ncare he is receiving from the VA, his outlook is good. (Tr. 42) He denied that he minimized \nhis mental-health issues. (Tr. 43) He noted that he fully disclosed his mental-health \ndiagnosis on his SCA, and he included the hospitals where he received treatment. He \nsaid Dr. H did not review any medical records after 2016. (Tr. 43) She did not review his \nVA medical records. (Tr. 43) \nDr. H concluded her evaluation: \nWith continued adherence with prescribed medication, his prognosis is \nconsidered good. Without medication, he would be at risk for another manic \nepisode. Consultation with his current medical providers at the VA would be \nhelpful to verify his compliance. With the discrepant information he \ncontinues to provide and in the absence of medical oversight, what may \notherwise be minor concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness are \nmore significant. (GE 2 at 11) \nApplicant\u2019s VA records indicate that he continues to received regular therapy. (Tr. \n44) He is treatment compliant and invested in management and resolution of his \nsymptoms. (Tr. 45) He is currently taking 375 milligrams of Seroquel and 400 milligrams \nof Lamictal daily, which are mood stabilizers.

A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security /concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), 28(c), and 28(d). Further details will \nbe discussed in the mitigation analysis, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant had manic episodes in August 2014, August 2015, and October 2015, \nfollowed by inpatient care in a military mental-health facility, for seven days on each \noccasion. He was diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder. Applicant\u2019s diagnosis was made \nusing the criteria in DSM-5. \nDSM-5 states: \nBipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder may have increased \nactivity, poor concentration, and increased impulsivity, but these features \nare episodic, occurring several days at a time. In bipolar disorder, increased \nimpulsivity or inattention is accompanied by elevated mood, grandiosity, \nand other specific bipolar features. (DSM-5 at 64) \nThe bipolar I disorder criteria represent the modern understanding of the \nclassic manic-depressive disorder or affective psychosis described in the \nnineteenth century, differing from that classic description only to the extent \nthat neither psychosis nor the lifetime experience of a major depressive \nepisode is a requirement. However, the vast majority of individuals whose \nsymptoms meet the criteria for a fully syndromal manic episode also \nexperience major depressive episodes during the course of their lives. \n(DSM-5 at 123) \nThe Diagnostic Criteria for Bipolar I disorder is as follows: \nFor a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, it is necessary to meet the following \ncriteria for a manic/episode. The manic episode may have been preceded \nby and may be followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nManic Episode \nA. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or \nirritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed \nactivity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly \nevery day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary). \nB. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, \nthree (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) \nare present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from \nusual behavior: \n1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. \n2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). \n3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. \n4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. \n5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant \nexternal stimuli), as reported or observed. \n6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or \nsexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed \nactivity). \n7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful \nconsequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual \nindiscretions, or foolish business investments). \nC. The mood disturbance is sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment \nin social or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization to \nprevent harm to self or others, or there are psychotic features. \nD. The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance \n(e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or to another medical \ncondition. \nNote: A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment \n(e.g., medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully \nsyndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient \nevidence for a manic episode and, therefore, a bipolar I diagnosis. \nNote: Criteria A-D constitute a manic episode. At least one lifetime manic \nepisode is required for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. (DSM-5 at 123\u00ad\n124) \nA manic episode may result in behavior: that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s \njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, and it may result in an emotional, \nmental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible behavior or \nself-harm. A person in the throes of a manic episode might jeopardize national security. \nFrom August 2014 to around October 2015, Applicant was not fully compliant with \nthe recommendations of mental-health practitioners to take medications which would bar \nhim from flying high-performance jet aircraft. He minimized his symptoms and convinced \nhimself that he had a sleep disorder and the Bipolar diagnosis was incorrect. He wanted \nto remain in the Air Force.

Dec. 10, 2019) the Appeal Board affirmed \nthe grant of a security clearance in a case involving conflicting expert mental-health \nwitness opinions, and cogently explained the necessity of reconciling opposing expert \nwitness opinions stating: \nA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative \nreliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007). \nA Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. \nRather, the Judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in \ndeciding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. See. e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0265 at 4 (Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-0288 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000). In this case, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the \nmagnitude and recency of Dr. Y\u2019s contacts with Applicant in combination \nwith other corroborating evidence merited more weight than the \nuncorroborated opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B is sustainable. \nAfter October 2015, Applicant accepted the Bipolar diagnosis. He has taken his \nprescribed medication and complied with VA treatment recommendations. Dr. H \nconcluded his Bipolar disorder was in remission; however, Dr. H\u2019s concern related to \nApplicant\u2019s future compliance with mental-health advice because of her questions about \nthe accuracy of some of the information he provided. Dr. H specifically recommended \ncontact with the VA to determine current compliance with mental-health medication \nrecommendations. Dr. H had not reviewed any of the medical records generated after \nJanuary 2016, when he started VA mental-health treatment. \nApplicant, his spouse, his mother, and father were all credible and consistent \nwitnesses. His spouse and mother are nurses. His father is familiar with Bipolar \nsymptoms. They assured that they will insist that Applicant seek medical attention if or \nwhen a Bipolar or manic episode occurs. Applicant has not had a Bipolar episode since \nOctober 2015, a period of over six years. \nOn May 3, 2022, LCSW F said Applicant voluntarily entered a counseling and \ntreatment program; his Bipolar condition is readily controllable with treatment; he \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his treatment plan; and he has a \nfavorable prognosis. LCSW F\u2019s prognosis is more reliable than Dr. H\u2019s concerns about \nwhether Applicant will comply with treatment recommendations because of the \nmagnitude and recency of LCSW F\u2019s contacts with Applicant.

A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of Appellant\u2019s acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline I are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old deputy program manager for a Defense contractor. He \nhas a bachelor\u2019s degree in business, a master\u2019s degree in aeronautical science, and a \nproject management professional certification. His father is a retired Air Force officer, and \nboth of his grandfathers served in the military. He successfully completed pilot training \nand was assigned to fly KC-10s. He completed three combat deployments as a copilot \nand one combat deployment as an aircraft commander, and he has more than 1,000 \ncombat flight hours. He received numerous Air Force awards and completed several Air \nForce training courses. He made important contributions to the Air Force during his \ncareer, and he was awarded six Air Medals. \nApplicant had manic episodes in August 2014, August 2015, and October 2015, \nfollowed by seven days of inpatient care in a military mental-health facility on each \noccasion. He was correctly diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder. He was medically retired \nfrom the Air Force because of Bipolar disorder, and he has a 70 percent VA disability \nrating because of Bipolar disorder. He has not experienced a manic episode since \nOctober 2015. I am confident Applicant or his family will inform medical authorities if a \nmanic episode is beginning, and he will continue to comply with mental-health treatment \nrecommendations. Based on his background, I am also confident he will scrupulously \nsafeguard classified information. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. He does not have children. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He began work for a federal contractor in April 2019. He worked at various jobs from 2013 to 2019, including working in food service, at liquor stores, retail stores and computer repair. He had long sketches of unemployment with periods of short, contract jobs from 2009 to 2013. (Item 3) Applicant received treatment, with varying frequency, at a health and human services center, from about June 2006 to about June 2009, for Bipolar Mood Disorder. His treatment consisted mostly of obtaining free samples of medication. His mental health and substance abuse history shows he received outpatient psychological treatment and tried a myriad of medications.

The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 2 through 12 (Item 1 is the SOR). \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. He did not provide a \nresponse, submit documents, or object to any of the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 2 \nthrough 12 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except \u00b6 2.d, which he denied. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. He does not \nhave children. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He began work for a federal \ncontractor in April 2019. He worked at various jobs from 2013 to 2019, including working \nin food service, at liquor stores, retail stores and computer repair. He had long sketches \nof unemployment with periods of short, contract jobs from 2009 to 2013. (Item 3) \nApplicant received treatment, with varying frequency, at a health and human \nservices center, from about June 2006 to about June 2009, for Bipolar Mood Disorder. \nHis treatment consisted mostly of obtaining free samples of medication. His mental \nhealth and substance abuse history shows he received outpatient psychological \ntreatment and tried a myriad of medications. (Items 2, 3, 5) \nIn September 2020, Applicant was evaluated by a duly qualified licensed \npsychologist (LP) approved by the Government. Based on an interview, a review of \navailable records, and an analysis of his current psychological results, the LP diagnosed \nApplicant with Bipolar II Disorder, in remission, and Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, \ncurrently in remission. He advised the LP that he was not currently abusing alcohol, but \nstill consumed beer despite the severe difficulties it had caused him in the past. His \nconsumption would increase during football season. He told the LP that in 2008 he had \nstopped drinking heavily when he moved back into his parents\u2019 house, but admitted that \nhe continued to consume alcohol and hid his drinking from his parents while living there. \nApplicant did not desire to undergo formal treatment for his psychological disorders. \n(Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \nThe LP found that Applicant\u2019s psychiatric conditions and lack of ongoing \ntreatment could ultimately lead to compromised reliability, judgment, stability, and \ntrustworthiness. She concluded Applicant\u2019s prognosis is guarded. (Item 5) \nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, \nfrom about 1994 to at least September 2020. He continued to consume alcohol, but \ndecreased his drinking in 2008. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the psychological \ncondition allegations and stated: \u201cI have stopped drinking completely as the pandemic \nprogressed and am open to formal treatment.\u201d There is no evidence of any alcohol-\nrelated incidents since 2005 or that he has consumed alcohol since 2020.

Referred to \ngroup dynamics for driver safety. Completed March of 2019, 14 years after the offense.\u201d \nHe provided no explanation for his delay. (Items 2, 3, 5) \nApplicant used marijuana from about June 1996 to at least May 2017. He was \narrested in 1999 for possession of drug paraphernalia. He was found guilty, and was \ngiven a six-month suspended jail sentence, and had his license suspended. He was \narrested in March 2001 for possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of \nmarijuana. He was found guilty. He was arrested in about July 2005 for possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. He was found guilty and was given a $323 fine. (Items 2, 6, 10, 11) \nApplicant was arrested twice in 2006 (May and August) for operating a vehicle \nwhile his license was revoked (3rd  offense). He was found guilty both times and \nsentenced to one day in jail. (Items 2, 8, 9) \nApplicant was arrested in March 2007 for possession of drug paraphernalia and \npossession of marijuana. He was found guilty and given a four-month jail sentences that \nwas suspended, a six-month suspended license, and one year of probation with no use \nof drugs or alcohol, and to attend substance abuse treatment. (Items 2, 7) \nApplicant was arrested in 2012 for obstruction of justice, or congress, or \nlegislative, or commission. He stated in his SOR answer that he was obstructing a street \nthat was closed by police barricades during a permitted protest. In June 2013, Applicant \nwas arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of marijuana. He \nwas found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and a $400 fine. (Items 2, 6, 12) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in July 2019. During his \ninterview, he acknowledged his past drug use. He indicated his likelihood of being \ninvolved in illegal drugs in the future was very low. He said he had switched to craft beer \nand was learning how to lead a more responsible life without indulging in the use of \nmarijuana. He had moved to a new city and no longer socialized with the people he \nused drugs with. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in determining an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, states that the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe trustworthiness concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 \n27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative interference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.  \nApplicant was evaluated in September 2020 by a duly qualified and approved by \nthe Government LP. She diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar II Disorder, in remission, and \nAlcohol Use Disorder, severe, currently in remission. The LP found that Applicant\u2019s \npsychiatric conditions and lack of ongoing treatment could ultimately lead to \ncompromised reliability, judgment, stability, and trustworthiness. She concluded \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis is guarded. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 29 were considered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nApplicant did not offer any evidence of action or treatment he may have \nparticipated in. He stated to the LP at the time of his evaluation that he did not desire to \nundergo formal treatment for his psychological disorder. In his more recent answer to \nthe SOR, he said that he was now open to formal treatment, but offered no evidence of \ntreatment he has received. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the trustworthiness concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence.  \nApplicant was convicted in 2005 of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and was \nordered to complete an AODA assessment and group dynamics counseling. Applicant \nfailed to complete it until March 2019. Technically, Applicant completed the court \nordered requirement, and I will not consider this under the disqualifying conditions, but \nmay consider his delay in completion when applying the mitigating conditions and in the \nwhole-person analysis. AG \u00b6 22(g) does not apply. \nApplicant consumed alcohol from 1994 to at least September 2020, at times in \nexcess and to the point of intoxication. He decreased his consumption in 2008. In \nSeptember 2020 he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, currently in \nremission by a duly qualified Government approved LP. Applicant continued to \nconsume alcohol after his diagnosis. In his SOR answer, provided subsequent to \nreceiving the December 2021 SOR, he said he had stopped drinking alcohol \ncompletely. The evidence supports the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(d). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \nApplicant was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, currently in \nremission in 2020. He declined treatment and continued to consume alcohol. He \ndecreased his alcohol consumption in 2008. In 2020 he stopped drinking alcohol. There \nis no evidence of any other alcohol-related incidents after his 2005 DWI or that he has \nconsumed alcohol since 2020. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a control substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana from approximately 1996 to May 2017. He was \narrested in, 2001, 2007, and 2013 for possession of marijuana and possession of drug \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparaphernalia. He was arrested in 1999 and 2005 for possession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for an extensive period of time. During his background \ninterview he told the government investigator that he stopped using marijuana in 2017 \nand was acting more responsibly. He said that he no longer associated with friends he \nhad used it with. He said he had a low probability of using it again. Although not a \ndefinitive statement, I find since it has been five years since he last used marijuana, it is \nunlikely he will use it again. I find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe trustworthiness concerns for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of violating the law. He was arrested and found guilty \nfor possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in 1999, 2001, 2005, 2007, and \n2013. He was arrested in 2005 and found guilty of operating a vehicle while intoxicated. \nHe had his driver\u2019s licenses revoked, but continued to drive and was arrested and \nconvicted twice in 2006 for operating a vehicle while his license was revoked. He was \nalso arrested in 2012 for obstructing a street that was barricaded off by police. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n32 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe last criminal offense alleged occurred in 2013. The evidence may support \nthat because of the age of these offenses without additional misconduct that it is \nunlikely that that future criminal conduct will occur. However, the evidence supports that \nApplicant has a disregard for the law and repeatedly violated it, despite the minor nature \nof most of the offenses. He was repeatedly arrested for the same thing, possession of \nmarijuana and drug paraphernalia and driving on a revoked license. This reflects his \nindifference to observing the law and taking his criminal conduct seriously. In addition, \nthe fact that he waited 14 years to complete a requirement by the court to participate in \nan AODA equally shows his disregard for following rules. Applicant provided no \nexplanation for why he repeatedly failed to follow the law. No evidence was provided to \nexplain his conduct or remorse. In the world of public trust eligibility requirements, one \nmust be confident that the rules are followed. Despite the minor nature of most of the \noffenses and passage of time, there is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. \nApplicant conduct over the course of years, casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Although, AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) have some \napplication, it is insufficient to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s conduct. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the \nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole. Supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrest for operating a vehicle while intoxicated; use of \nmarijuana from 1996 to 2017; numerous arrests for use of marijuana and possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; operating a vehicle after his license was revoked, on more than one \noccasion, support a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and unwillingness to comply with the rules and regulations. I find the \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s continued use of alcohol after being diagnosed with Alcohol Use\nDisorder, severe does not apply as disqualifying under this guideline because his \ndisorder is in remission and there is no evidence of him drinking irresponsibly after his \n2005 DWI or after his 2020 diagnosis. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17 are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to conclude that he has \nacknowledged his behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the factors that contributed to his conduct or to conclude \nit is unlikely to happen again. The analysis under Guideline J also applies under this \nguideline. Despite some minimal application under AG \u00b6 17(a), it is insufficient to \nmitigate the personal conduct trustworthiness concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E, G, H, I, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. There is insufficient evidence to \novercome the trustworthiness concerns raised under Guidelines E, personal conduct, \nGuideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Applicant has \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption and \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 5, Guideline H \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 5.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

This is Applicant\u2019s first \napplication for a security clearance. (Item 3 at 7-11, 27-28, 59; Item 5 at 3) \nIn January 2020, Applicant was applying for a U.S. linguist position with a \ndefense contractor. Between December 2019 and January 2020, Applicant was a U.S. \ncab driver. From September to December 2019, he was a car salesman. He was \nunemployed in the United States between April and September 2019. From October \n2018 to April 2019, he invested $70,000 (discussed below) in a U.S. oil and lube \nbusiness that failed before opening. From January to October 2018, Applicant was \nunemployed. From July 2014 to January 2018, Applicant was the owner of two U.S. \nrestaurants that he sold in January 2018 for $300,000. See discussion below. \nApplicant\u2019s previous employment included an operations management position from \nJuly 2013 to April 2014, an ownership position of an unknown business from January \n2010 to July 2013, and an operations management position from August 2008 to \nJanuary 2010. The last three jobs were located in three middle eastern countries. (Item \n5 at 1-3) \nFinancial Considerations \nIn his December 2019 PSI, Applicant explained that he initially considered his \ngambling as a hobby. (Item 10 at 8-9) However, his gambling increased and became a \nproblem. In his October 2019 e-QIP, Applicant indicated that between April and August \nof that year, he lost about $45,000 gambling. (SOR 1.g; Item 3 at 60) The loss caused \nhim to default on his credit card accounts that are listed in the SOR. He identified the \nlisted delinquent credit card accounts and explained that he was waiting on a decent job \nto settle the debt. He did some gambling research and took an online gambling class \nrecommended by a financial advisor. \nApplicant explained that business losses and underemployment were the \nreasons he had financial trouble over the years. In January 2013, he sold his first \nbusiness (two restaurants) for $300,000 to pay off his $230,000 debt. Instead of paying \noff the entire debt, he paid off only $130,000 of the debt and kept $170,000 for savings \nand investment. From October 2018 to April 2019, he invested $70,000 in an oil and \nlube business which failed before opening. His motivation for gambling was to recoup \nhis losses to pay off his delinquent debt.

Since 2006, the United States has provided \nmore than $2 billion in bilateral foreign assistance to Lebanon to support strengthening \nstate institutions and security agencies after years of Syrian dominance; to reinforce \nvital public services; to preserve the multi-sectarian character of Lebanon; and to \ncounter and retard Hizballah's military presence in retaining its arms in Lebanon. Along \nwith the international community, the United States supports full implementation of \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolutions 1559, 1680, and 1701 for the disarming of \nall militias, delineation of the Lebanese-Syrian border, and the deployment of the \nLebanese Armed Forces throughout Lebanon. The United States is Lebanon's primary \nsecurity partner. U.S.-provided aircraft, munitions, vehicles, and training have increased \nthe capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to fight violent extremism. U.S. assistance \nhas also strengthened Lebanon's Internal Security Forces in its efforts to prevent \ncriminal and terrorist threats; to secure and safeguard Lebanon's territorial integrity and \npeople; and to extend the rule of law throughout the country. \nLebanon has a free-market economy that is largely service-oriented with \ngrowth in the banking and tourism sectors. The United States and Lebanon have signed \na Trade and Investment Framework agreement to expand trade relations, and remove \nobstacles to trade and investment between the two countries. Lebanon and the United \nStates belong to some of the same international organizations, including the United \nNations, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. \nLebanon is the temporary home for many refugees in the world, including over \none million from Syria, which further strained Lebanon's already weak infrastructure and \nability to deliver social services in 2018. U.S. humanitarian assistance in Lebanon \nsupports the needs of Syrian refugees by providing food, shelter, medical care, clean \nwater, sanitation, and psychosocial support. \nIn 2017, Lebanon's most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or \nunlawful killings, including by government forces and non-state perpetrators. There \nwere no reports of government forces committing arbitrary or unlawful killings in 2018. \nAllegations of torture by security forces; undue and increasing restrictions on freedom \nof speech and the press, including laws criminalizing libel and forms of political \nexpression; and official corruption were issues in 2017 and 2018. Although the legal \nsystem authorizes prosecution and punishment of officials for human rights abuses, \nenforcement remained a problem in 2017 and 2018, and misconduct by government \nofficials for human rights abuses. \nIn September 2018, the U.S. State Department issued a Level 3 travel advisory \nfor Lebanon, urging U.S. citizens to reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas of \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLebanon because of threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of \nviolence, particularly near Lebanon's borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living \nand working in Lebanon are advised that they accept the risk of remaining in the \ncountry. Although Lebanon was a committed ally in the fight to defeat ISIS in 2017 and \nits ground forces were one of the most effective counterterrorism partners in the region, \nU.S. citizens have been targeted by terrorist attacks in Lebanon in the past. The threat \nof anti-Western terrorist activity continues, as does the risk of death or injury as a \nbystander. Violent extremist groups operate in Lebanon, including the U.S. government-\ndesignated terrorist organizations of Hizballah, ISIS, Al-Nusrah Front, Hamas, and the \nAbdullah Azzam Brigades. Lebanon's 12 Palestinian refugee camps, including the \nlargest Ain el-Helweh, remain outside the jurisdiction of local security forces and pose a \nsecurity threat due to potential militant recruitment and terrorist infiltration. U.S. citizens \nare advised to avoid travel to refugee settlements. \nKidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, is a \nproblem in Lebanon. The U.S. government's ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or \ntaken hostage is limited. U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon in spite of the \ntravel advisory are advised that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always \nable to travel to assist them. U.S. citizens who also hold Lebanese citizenship are \nsubject to the requirements and responsibilities of Lebanese citizenship under \nLebanese law. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, are applied together with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAn applicant who seeks a security clearance with the Government must \ndemonstrate good judgment and trustworthiness. A gauge of these characteristics can \nbe determined by an evaluation of how he manages his personal affairs. An applicant \nwho has a history of financial irresponsibility in paying his voluntarily incurred debts may \nalso demonstrate irresponsibility in failing to comply with rules and regulations for \nsafeguarding sensitive or classified information. \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that could raise a security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to \nfund gambling or pay gambling debts. \nApplicant\u2019s June 2021 answer to the SOR, his December 2019 PSI, his \nNovember 2019 e-QIP, and Applicant\u2019s his January 2020 focused screening \nquestionnaire, and the three government credit reports, establish the Government\u2019s \ncase under the guideline for financial considerations. Applicant has a history of not \nmeeting his financial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) apply.

AG \u00b6 19(h) applies to the $45,000 in gambling losses Applicant \nsustained between April and August 2019, and his ongoing gambling routine despite the \ndelinquent debts identified in SOR 1.a through 1h. \nThe pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant still owes more than $118,000 to \nseven creditors. The lack of a plan to address the delinquencies continues to raise \ndoubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant receives some mitigation for the unanticipated unemployment and \nunderemployment he experienced over the years. However, he receives no mitigation \nunder the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), because he has taken no action (acting \nresponsibly under the circumstances) on the listed delinquent debts. Nor has he \ncontacted the creditors to advise them why he cannot pay them. He receives no \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) for the same reasons. Applicant receives no mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(c) because he submitted no evidence of financial counseling that \neducates him on how to manage his finances so he can repay his debts. Gambling is \ncertainly not a responsible method of managing one\u2019s finances or repaying significant \ndebt. \nForeign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 sets forth the security under Guideline B: \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology;  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk off foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections to family members are only \ndisqualifying if they create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security \nduties and his desire to assist his foreign family members. \nApplicant\u2019s regular contacts with his two sisters, his parents-in-law and father-\nin-law, and his best friend, who are citizens and residents of Lebanon, create a \n10 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nheightened risk of foreign inducement and pressure. These foreign-family connections \nalso create a potential conflict of interest for him. Though Applicant\u2019s mother is now a \npermanent resident of the United States, and lives at Applicant\u2019s residence for six \nmonths of every year since 2014, she is still a citizen residing in Lebanon during the \nother six months of the year. While his wife is a permanent resident living with \nApplicant, she is still a citizen of Lebanon with a Lebanese bank account that she uses \nwhen she is in the country. In sum, Applicant\u2019s relationships with relatives living in \nLebanon, even his mother who lives there part of the year, create a heightened \ninducement under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e), combined with a potential conflict of interest \nunder 7(b). In addition, Applicant\u2019s ownership of a home in Lebanon with an unknown \nvalue, and his two parcels of land valued at $30,000, trigger an additional heightened \nrisk or personal conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(f). The security concerns created by \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members are magnified when evaluated with ongoing terrorist \nactivity in Lebanon. The U.S. State Department has issued repeated warnings of \nterrorism directed against or affecting U.S. and Western interests.  \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply to the facts of this case because Applicant\u2019s foreign \nfamily members could place him in a compromising position of having to choose \nbetween the interest of the family members or the United States. Applicant has close \nties and contacts with his sisters and his in-laws. Though his family members have no \n11 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naffiliation with any foreign government, given the risk of terrorist activity and armed \nconflict in the country, I cannot rule out the possibility that Applicant\u2019s family members \ncould be pressured by insurgents or government operatives to a point where Applicant \nis forced to choose between the interests of his family members and the interests of the \nUnited States. \nAlthough Applicant has some ties to the United States through his U.S. \ncitizenship that he received in June 2003, he has no significant assets or longstanding \nrelationships in the United States besides his home that he purchased in 2016. Other \nthan a mortgage and a monthly car payment, there is little or no other evidence \nregarding Applicant\u2019s financial assets, i.e., savings or checking account, retirement \naccount, stock portfolio, or investment fund, in the United States. Based on his frequent \ncontact with his foreign family members and his friend, AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing ties to his foreign family members and his friend, along with his \nsignificant property interests in Lebanon, including two parcels of land valued at \n$30,000, a home he inherited in 2014, and a car valued at $10,000, could result in a \nconflict that could be used to effectively influence Applicant to act against U.S. interests. \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) or 8(f) apply. I find for Applicant under SOR 2.j because he stopped \nproviding financial support to his mother when she moved to the United States in 2014. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly stressed the importance of an \napplicant presenting evidence that shows a meaningful track record of debt reduction, \nwhich includes a plan to fix his debt problem and significant action towards \nconsummation of the plan. See, ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul 6, 2006) \nWithout a plan and action to implement the plan, Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion under the guideline for financial considerations.

Having weighed and balanced all the \nevidence under the specific conditions in light of the record as a whole, Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from the guidelines for financial \nconsiderations and foreign influence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

He disclosed that he used it while possessing \na security clearance and that he did not intend to use it in the future. (GE 1 at 31, 32)  \n(3) Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, While Possessing a Security \nClearance, inquired: \u201cHave you ever illegally used or otherwise been illegally involved \nwith a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security clearance other than \npreviously listed,\u201d Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d (GE 1 at 32) \nIn May 2020, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about his illegal drug \nuse and other background issues. Applicant discussed using marijuana while employed \nat the Army hospital. He told the investigator that in September 2019, he tested positive \nfor marijuana while employed with the Army, which resulted in his termination. Applicant \nstated that after his supervisor notified him of his positive drug test, he was placed on \nadministrative leave and terminated on October 25, 2019. He showed the investigator the \ntermination notice. (GE 2 at 3) \nApplicant told the investigator that he used marijuana about eight times and \ncannabidiol, a chemical found in marijuana (CBD), twice. He used CBD oil for insomnia \nand migraines. He did not have a medical marijuana card. He purchased marijuana from \na stranger. He acknowledged that his use of marijuana and CBD was the reason for his \ntermination. He said he did not intend to use it in the future. (GE 2 at 5) \nSubsequent to his interview, the Government sent Applicant Interrogatories, which \nincorporated the report of his May 2020 interview and asked him to verify the accuracy of \nthe information in that report. Applicant confirmed that the information was accurate. In \naddition, the Government asked him to complete Interrogatories which asked the \nfollowing question: \u201cIn your interview, you disclosed that you used marijuana between \nJanuary 2019 and August 2019. Have you used marijuana since then?\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d (GE 2 at 10) In response to two other questions, he reported that he did \nnot intend to use marijuana in the future and that he no longer associates with the people \nwith whom he used it. (Id.) \nApplicant testified that he knew as a surgical assistant and as a federal employee \nholding a security clearance, he was prohibited from using marijuana or any illegal \nsubstance. He understood the adverse consequences of buying and using marijuana \nwhile employed in his position. He started using it because he witnessed gruesome \ntrauma surgeries, which caused him serious emotional distress that he chose to manage \nwith marijuana. (Tr. 25-33; GE 2 at 5) He said that he used marijuana for recreational \npurposes and CBD oil for medical purposes. (Tr. 33) \nApplicant was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) in March \n2018, prior to his discharge from the Army. He continues to suffer from it. After being \ndiagnosed with PTSD, he began participating in therapy once a week for about two \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmonths with a psychologist at the Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital.

He has never been referred to a psychiatrist for medication, \nalthough he said he has requested it. He has continued to use marijuana monthly since \n2019. He used it a week before this hearing and intends to continue using it. (Tr. 35-41, \n54; GE 2) \n \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant admitted that he was fired from his employment at the Department of \nthe Army in about October 2019 for testing positive for marijuana, and was not eligible for \nrehire, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. (Answer) \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b, which alleged he deliberately failed \nto disclose in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drug Activity of his March 2020 e-QIP the \ninformation set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a: He used marijuana with varying frequency, from about \nJanuary 2019 to about August 2019, while granted access to classified information. He \nstated that he disclosed his illegal drug use under Section 23 in his e-QIP. In addition, \nApplicant asserted that he gave all of the information surrounding his drug use and \ntermination to the investigator during his May 2020 interview. (Answer) \nApplicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c that alleged he intentionally failed \nto disclose under Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drug Activity, While Possessing a Security \nClearance, that he illegally used a drug while possessing a security clearance. Applicant \nadmitted that he did not disclose the information under this heading because he disclosed \nit in the previous paragraph in Section 23. (Answer) \n \nFinancial Considerations \nBased on credit bureau reports from October 2018, May 2020, April 2021, and \nFebruary 2022, the SOR alleged six delinquent debts, which became delinquent between \n2017 and 2021. (GE 3, 4, 5, and 6) They total $12,154. In his Answer to the SOR, he \ndenied owing all six debts because his mortgage company required him to resolve all of \nhis delinquent debts before applying for a mortgage to purchase a home. (Answer) The \nstatus of each debt is as follows: \n(3.a) Applicant said that this charged-off credit card debt for $12,044 was settled\nfor less and paid after the creditor obtained a judgment and then a lien. He said the \naccount became delinquent before he started working for the Army because he could not \nafford to pay it. He said he settled it prior to May 24, 2021, the day he closed on a home. \n(Tr. 41-45; AE G) He agreed to submit proof of the settlement and payment, but did not \ndo so. It is not resolved. \n \n(3.b) Applicant said the charged-off $3,137 motorcycle loan was a personal loan \nhe obtained in 2016. He settled the debt and paid it. He thinks he received a Cancellation \nof Debt document from the creditor in the amount of the loan. (Tr. 46-49) He agreed to \nsubmit documents verifying that it was resolved, but did not do so.

(Tr. 20-21) \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), which \nbecame effective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AGs. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to the illegal use of controlled \nsubstances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental \nimpairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment \nand because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \n\"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is \nthe generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out four conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has a history of illegally possessing and using marijuana. He admitted \nthat from January 2019 to July 14, 2022 (the date of this hearing), he illegally purchased \nand used marijuana. In September 2019, he tested positive for marijuana while \nemployed by the Army. He intends to continue using it in the future. The evidence \nestablishes the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns raised under \nthis guideline: The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements,\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish any of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant has been illegally using and possessing marijuana since January 2019, over \nthree years. He intends to continue using it. He does not believe he has a drug problem \nand has not taken steps to address the issue. He has not participated in a substance \nabuse treatment program or been evaluated by a mental health professional for \nsubstance abuse. His ongoing use of marijuana casts doubt on his judgment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the trustworthiness concerns relating to personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that in October 2019, Applicant was fired from his employment \nwith the Army for testing positive for marijuana and not being eligible for rehire. The \nevidence establishes a disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16 (e)(1) because he engaged \nin personal misconduct which could affect his professional standing, if known by other \nemployers or professionals. \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c that Applicant deliberately failed \nto disclose his purchase and use of marijuana, an illegal drug, from January 2019 to about \nAugust 2019, while having been granted access classified information. After reviewing \nhis March 2020 e-QIP, his May 2020 interview, and 2020 Interrogatories, I do not find that \nhe deliberately withheld requested information from the Government about his drug \npurchase and use, frequency of his use, and the fact that he had had been granted access \nto classified information during that time frame. To the contrary, he disclosed his \ntermination from his Army position under Section 13A. Under Section 23 of his e-QIP, he \ndisclosed his use of marijuana, and that he possessed a security clearance at the time \nhe used it. He disclosed this information in the initial paragraph of Section 23, and not \nunder the heading \u201cWhile Possessing a Security Clearance,\u201d three paragraphs down. His \ndisclosures in the e-QIP sufficiently notified the Government of his illegal drug use, such \nthat I do not find that he deliberately attempted to withhold information from the \nGovernment. In his interview, he forthrightly discussed his positive drug test and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubsequent termination. He also admitted the misconduct in his 2020 Interrogatories. The \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c are refuted. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate the trustworthiness concern raised \nin SOR \u00b6 2.a. Two are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nThe evidence does not establish the above mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s \ntermination in October 2019 for testing positive for marijuana while working for the Army \nand having been granted access to classified information was not a minor offense. \nApplicant candidly acknowledged his past use of marijuana. He clearly stated that he \ndoes not intend to stop using marijuana and has taken no actions to do so. Based on his \nstated intention, he may continue to associate with people who are involved in criminal \nactivities, such as selling illegal drugs. He failed to mitigate the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. The following two are potentially applicable in this case: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant acknowledged that he was financially unable to satisfy debts that started \nto become delinquent in 2017. The evidence establishes both disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. Four are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant stated that he was required to resolve all six delinquent debts before he \ncould obtain a mortgage to purchase a home. He said he paid his debts prior to May \n2021, so he could close on his house. However, he did not provide proof of resolution for \nfour of the alleged debts, including the largest debt for $12,000. \nApplicant provided evidence that he paid and resolved the $2,805 delinquent debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c, and the $1,273 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.d. There is \nsufficient evidence to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) and AG \u00b6 20(d) as to these \ndebts. There is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the mitigating \nconditions for the remaining four unresolved debts. Applicant admitted that his debts \narose because he spent more money than he earned before he started working for the \nArmy in late 2018, and that he did not start to resolve them until he decided to purchase \na home in 2021. He did not submit evidence that his finances are under control, or that \nhe has a payment plan for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, 3.e, and 3.f, and that he \nis making payments on those plans. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant access to sensitive \ninformation must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 27-year-old \nveteran who honorably served in the Army. After leaving military service in March 2018, \nhe was diagnosed with PTSD. He started working for an Army hospital in December 2018. \nHe found his job as a surgical assistant to be difficult and stressful. Sometime in January \n2019, he began purchasing and using marijuana while holding a security clearance. He \ncontinues to use marijuana and intends to use it in the future. He said that he uses it \nrecreationally and for medical purposes. As a consequence of his history of using \nmarijuana over the past three years, and his intention to continue using it, he has not \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns under the guidelines for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and personal conduct. In addition, he failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations because he did not provide evidence that he resolved four delinquent \ndebts, which he asserted he paid. \n Formal Findings \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n               \n \n                \n \n \n \n                               \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n     \n \nFor Applicant \n11 \n  Subparagraph 2.a: \n     Subparagraph 2.b:  \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n     Subparagraph 2.c: \n                                     For Applicant \n \n                               AGAINST A\n PPLICANT \n \n      \n \n \n  \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:    \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n   Against Applicant    \n      Subparagraphs 3.c and 3.d:                              For Applicant \n      Subparagraphs 3.e and 3.f: \n \n \n     Against Applicant            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of trust. \nShari Dam \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. He is a high school graduate and served in the military \nfrom 1999 until he retired in 2019 in the paygrade E-6. He married in 1995 and has been \nseparated from his wife since 2017. Before then, they had intermittent contact from 2015 \nto 2017. He testified he does not know where she lives. He does not have children. (Tr. \n17-20) \nApplicant presently cohabitates with a female friend who has a toddler child. She \ndid not work during the COVID pandemic and recently returned to work. She does not \ncontribute to the household expenses. Applicant purchased her a car in January 2022 \nand pays the $600 monthly payments. (Tr. 46-50) \nApplicant has worked for a federal contractor since his retirement from the military. \nHe stated his annual salary is approximately $66,000. He receives $1,700 a month from \nhis military pension, and $2,000 in veteran\u2019s disability. He said that at the end of the \nmonth, after paying all of his expenses, he has several hundred dollars remaining. He \nhas minimal savings. (Tr. 20-21) \nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts totaling approximately $70,363. Applicant \ncontacted the creditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($388), which was for car \ninsurance. He believed he had canceled the insurance, but the creditor disagreed. The \ndebt remains unresolved. Applicant has not contacted any of the other creditors for the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.k. He testified that he has not made any payments \non any of the alleged debts because he does not have the money. (Tr. 22-26) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his \nanswer to the SOR, his statement to a government investigator, his testimony, and credit \nreports from June 2020 and February 2021. (Answer to the SOR, GE 1, 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife. They purchased a house in \n2006 that cost more than he thought they could afford. They owned a triplex townhouse \nthat they rented and intended to use the rent from it to help pay the mortgage on the new \nhome. Applicant received orders to move overseas shortly after they purchased the \nhouse. His wife did not want to move and stayed in the United States. She was \nresponsible for collecting the rent on the triplex. Applicant paid the bills. In 2009, he \nnoticed that there were insufficient funds in their shared bank account to pay their \nmortgage. He asked his wife about it, and she said she needed the money to pay bills, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nand she did not have time to collect the rent. Applicant later learned the townhouse had \nbeen foreclosed and was for sale. He continued to make the mortgage payments on the \nmarital home. (Tr. 21, 40-45) \nWhen Applicant returned from overseas, he and his wife lived in the marital home \ntogether, but were separated. He told the investigator that he was out to sea about half \nthe time until he received orders in 2015 to move to a new state. His wife did not \naccompany him. In around 2018, he noticed that his wife was transferring money out of \ntheir joint account where his pay was deposited, to an account he did not have access. \nBecause she took the money, he was unable to pay the mortgage on the marital home. \nThe second time she transferred his pay to another account, she told him she had to send \nmoney to her family overseas. He then closed the account and opened an account in his \nindividual name that she did not have access. (Tr. 45-46) \nApplicant testified that in about September 2017, his wife contacted his military \ncommand to complain that he was not providing her support. He was required to provide \nher one-third of his pay. Because he was paying the mortgage on the marital home, rent \nfor where he was now living separately, both of their car loans, and other expenses, he \nwas unable to pay the other debts with the added penalties and interest. In August 2019, \nhe retired from the military and was no longer required to pay monthly spousal payments. \nHe testified that at this point, he was overwhelmed with the amount of his debt that he did \nnot know where to start and could not afford to pay his delinquencies. (Tr. 25, 29-31, 45-\n46) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 2020 interview with a government investigator, he said \nthat he had contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($4,161 - charged off \nSeptember 2017) and arranged to pay $100 monthly payments. He said the creditor \ncontinued to charge him late fees of $45 a month, which he thought was unfair because \nhis payments were primarily going towards the late fees and minimally reducing the \nbalance owed. The creditor refused to remove the late fees, so Applicant decided to stop \nmaking the payments and told the investigator he had no intention of paying the debt. \n(GE 2) \nRegarding the remaining debts in the SOR, Applicant told the investigator he had \nno intention of repaying them. He explained that he was frustrated with repaying the \naccounts and the associated fees and the only way he would pay them was if he won the \nlottery. He told the investigator that he did not intend to file for divorce because he did not \nwant his wife to receive half of his military pension and continue to live off of his financial \nsupport. At his hearing, he said he was angry at the time about everything when he made \nthe statement that he did not intend to pay the debts and now he is looking towards the \nfuture. He is haunted by the delinquent debts hanging over his head and his inability to \nmove forward financially. He hopes to resolve them, but has not taken any action. (Tr. 31-\n35; GE 2) \nApplicant has a credit card that he owes about $9,000. He tries to make more than \nthe minimum payment each month, and it is not delinquent. He began using a credit repair \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \ncompany, but realized for his $50 monthly payment, all it was doing was providing him \ncopies of his credit reports. (Tr. 52-54) \nWhen asked about if he had timely file his federal tax returns in the past, Applicant \ntestified that he had not filed his 2020 and 2021 federal income tax returns. He filed an \nextension for his 2020 tax return, but when he realized he did not have the money to pay \nthe tax owed, he chose not to file. He repeated his conduct when he failed to file his 2021 \nincome tax return. He did not file an extension. Both tax years remain unfiled and it is \nunknown if he owes taxes or the amount. He believed he may owe about $1,000 for tax \nyear 2020. He has not contacted the IRS to make payment arrangements for his \ndelinquent taxes. It is unknown if he owes federal income taxes for 2021.1 (Tr. 54-60) \nApplicant testified that he is not a risk to national security and he would never \nsuccumb to blackmail. He stated he has not dissolved his marriage because he does not \nknow where his wife is living. (Tr. 60) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying \npurposes. It may be used in making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, \nand in a whole-person analysis.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in about 2017 \nand are unresolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documentary \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to his wife mismanaging their money and \ntaking money from their joint account that was earmarked for certain expenses and using \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nit for other things. Applicant has not addressed or resolved any of the debts alleged in the \nSOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. His wife\u2019s \nmismanagement is partially beyond Applicant\u2019s control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has \nbeen aware for years of his wife\u2019s spending habits, her inattention to their financial \nobligations, her mismanagement of their finances, and her willingness to abscond with \nmoney from their joint account. He has not been required to provide her support since his \nretirement in 2019. He does not deny the debts he owes, but told the investigator that he \nwas unhappy with the interest and penalties that were added to his debts and was not \ngoing to pay them. \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he wants to resolve his delinquent debts, but is \nfinancially unable. He did not provide evidence that he is taking action on any of his \ndelinquent debts. There is no evidence he has participated in financial counseling or that \nhis financial problems are being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not \napply. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application because there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant disputed one debt that he said he attempted to resolve with the creditor \nover an insurance bill received after he had moved. He did not provide documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of his dispute or evidence of his effort to resolve the issue. AG \n\u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his wife\u2019s actions. However, he has \ntaken insufficient action, if any, to address the delinquent debts, which he admits he owes. \nHe provides support for a cohabitant who does not contribute to the household expenses \nand pays her car note. Applicant does not have a reliable financial track record. Applicant \nhas not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each alleged debt. He did not proffer any explanation or documents in response to the SOR allegations.

However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 4. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise any objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n4 could be considered as evidence in his case. As noted above, Applicant neither \nresponded to the FORM nor objected to Item 4. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 36, is unmarried with a 13-year-old child who does not reside with \nhim. He received his high school diploma in May 2004, and has been pursuing a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration since June 2009. This is his first application \nfor a security clearance.

On a date not identified in the record, he \nbecame employed by another defense contractor, who is currently sponsoring his security \nclearance application. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling $35,356, including a $1,009 \njudgment for a charged-off credit-card account; three medical accounts totaling $1,245; \nand 10 federal student loan accounts totaling $33,102. In his SOR answer, Applicant \nadmitted each alleged debt. He did not proffer any explanation or documents in response \nto the SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts generally to unemployment and the lack \nof a steady income; and his medical debts more specifically to expenses associated with \nan emergency-room visit at a time when he did not have health insurance in 2018. He did \nnot proffer any details or corroborating documents concerning his relevant income and \nexpense history or his ability to repay his debts. The record did not indicate whether he \nprovides child support or other financial support for his child. (Items 3, 4) \nFollowing his high school graduation, Applicant was unemployed, for reasons not \nindicated in the record, until May 2006. He worked full time as a loader/unloader for a \nwarehouse restoration business through January 2011, when the business shut down \ndue to the economic recession.

He was unemployed again until he found part-\ntime work in July 2015 as a package handler with another shipping company. He regained \nfull-time employment in August 2016 as a shipping specialist for a communications \ntechnology company. He ended his part-time position in March 2017 due to its \nincompatibility with his full-time work schedule. He left his full-time position in April 2018 \nfor a better job and career advancement opportunity with Defense Contractor 1. (Items \n3, 4) \nOn three occasions in January 2019, Applicant was interviewed in connection with \nhis security clearance background investigation. He described his then financial situation \nas stable due to his gainful employment. He did not anticipate any further financial \nproblems unless he were to lose his job. He did not receive any financial counseling, but \nproffered his own plan to better manage his finances by ensuring that he paid his bills on \ntime and working with his creditors to resolve his delinquent debts. (Item 4) \nA few weeks after his initial interview in January 2019, Applicant contacted the \ncreditors for his medical and student loan debts, but did not take any action to resolve his \ncredit-card debt. He was unsuccessful in making arrangements to pay his student loan \ndebts because he was not able to make an immediate payment. He anticipated that he \nwould be ready to make a payment the following month. He apparently set up a payment \narrangement to pay his medical debts. However, he did not proffer proof of any payment \narrangements or payments made towards either his medical or student loan debts. He \nmaintained that his medical debt creditor would only release a statement once there was \na $0 balance. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s March 2021 credit report revealed no new delinquent debts. However, \nit showed that he financed the purchase of a $15,541 automobile in May 2020 with a $415 \nmonthly payment, which was then in current status. His July 2018, October 2019, and \nMarch 2021 credit reports disclosed that two unresolved medical debts, which existed at \nthe time the SOR was issued, were not alleged: a $36 account and a $674 account. \nApplicant attributed them to the same emergency room visit as those alleged in the SOR. \n(Item 4 at 3; Items 6, 7, 8) \nIn 2013, Applicant consumed alcohol at a friend\u2019s home. On his drive from his \nfriend\u2019s home, he was pulled over by a police officer due to him swerving his vehicle. \nApplicant admitted that he knew it was a bad decision to drive after consuming alcohol, \nbut did so anyway because he wanted to celebrate the fourth of July holiday. He was \narrested and charged with misdemeanor driving under the influence (DUI) for which he \npled guilty. The court sentenced him to 90 days in jail, which was suspended pending his \nsuccessful completion of 24 months of probation and payment of a $1,500 fine. The \nrecord did not indicate whether Applicant successfully completed his probation and paid \nhis fine. Applicant asserted that there is zero likelihood of another DUI offense as he will \nnever again drive after consuming alcohol.

His tax year \n2017 refunds were applied to resolve them. (Item 3 at 35; Item 4 at 4) \nIn 2018, Applicant replaced his expired license plate with a valid license plate he \nborrowed from his cousin. He received a citation for which he paid a fine and court costs \ntotaling $387. (Item 4 at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s 2013 DUI, 2016 tax debt, and 2018 citation were not alleged in the \nSOR. Thus, I will consider them only to evaluate mitigation and the whole-person concept. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying condition under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Having considered \nall of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern under this guideline, \nI find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies to the extent that Applicant\u2019s medical debts were attributable to \nhis lack of health insurance and other debts to his unsteady work history. However, I am \nunable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b) because the record lacked sufficient detail for me to \nconclude that his debts persisted largely due to circumstances beyond his control or that \nhe acted responsibly to resolve his debts, particularly since he has been gainfully \nemployed since April 2018. Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that his 2013 DUI and \n2018 citation, which were not circumstances beyond his control, negatively impacted his \nfinances.  \nApplicant failed to establish that he resolved any of the delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR, including a significant amount of federal student loan debt. His 2016 tax debts \nwere passively resolved via tax refunds. Without documentary proof, I am unable to \nconclude that he made arrangements or payments towards his student loan and medical \ndebts as he claimed. I also am unable to conclude that his indebtedness is not likely to \nrecur and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Thus, \nI find that Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n(b), (d), and (g) are not established. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I also considered the pattern of \nquestionable judgment demonstrated by the circumstances underlying Applicant\u2019s 2016 \ntax debt, 2013 DUI offense, and 2018 citation. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On March 31, 2022, Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) originally scheduled the hearing for May \n16, 2022, but issued an Amended Notice of Video Teleconference Hearing on April 25, \n2022, rescheduling the hearing for June 16, 2022. The case was heard as rescheduled. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were \nadmitted without objection, except GE 3, 4, and 5 because he believed the exhibits \ncontained some inaccurate information. These documents are credit reports pertaining to \nApplicant\u2019s credit history and are admissible under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19 and the Federal \nRules of Evidence, which serve as a guide. I overruled Applicant\u2019s objection and advised \nhim that he was free to provide corrections to the exhibits as he deemed appropriate. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through L, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non June 24, 2022. (Tr. at 11-23.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 43 years old. He married in September 2020. He has three children, \nages 21, 17, and 15, and his wife has two children, ages 17 and 13, from a prior \nrelationship. Applicant received a high school diploma in 1998 and attended a technical \ninstitute for two years, but did not receive a degree or certification.

(Answer at 1; Tr. at 27, 32; GE 2 at 19.) \n1.b. June 2008 Charge of Felony Battery resulted from an incident in which \nApplicant was under the influence of alcohol. Applicant denied the battery charge, but \nadmitted that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the dispute with his \ndomestic partner and unplugged the house phone while his domestic partner was making \na call to 911. He was taken to jail intoxicated. The record evidence reflects that the battery \ncharge was a misdemeanor.

(Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 32-35; GE 8 at 17; GE 9 at 2, 4.) \n1.c. November 2008 charge of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). \nApplicant admitted that he pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of DUI and was ordered \nto complete a DUI program. He was given a sentence of probation for five years. His \ndriver\u2019s license was also suspended. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 28, 35-36; GE 7 at 3.) \n1.d. February 2009 charge of Drunk in Public amended at the hearing to Driving \non Suspended License (DSL). Applicant denied the original allegation because he has no \nmemory of any such charge or arrest. Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to \nconform to the Government\u2019s evidence. According to that evidence, Applicant was \nactually cited for DSL at that time. Applicant admitted this amended allegation. He was \nsentenced to probation for three years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 29, 35-37; GE 8 at 10; GE 10 \nat 8.) \n1.e. March 2010 charges of DUI and DSL and failure to complete court-ordered \nDUI program. In his Answer Applicant admitted the arrest on that date and the charges. \nHe was on probation at that time for his 2008 DUI and his DSL convictions. He pled guilty \nto misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to probation for five years. The court ordered \nhim to attend a program for multiple DUI offenders. He denied part of the SOR allegation \nbecause he disputed the Government\u2019s claim that he had not completed the DUI program. \nHe testified that he completed the program, but his certificate of completion was never \nsubmitted to the court. He requested the program manger to provide a duplicate certificate \nto the court, and he submitted a copy of the certificate into evidence at the DOHA hearing. \nThe certificate reflects that Applicant enrolled in the course in October 2012 and \ncompleted it in November 2016. He attributed the delay in enrolling and completing the \ncourse to his inability to pay the fees associated with the program. It took him about four \nyears to complete an 18-month program. He claims that he sought extensions from the \ncourt when he could not continue the program for financial reasons. (Answer at 2; Tr. at \n29-30, 38-39; GE 7 at 3; AE A.) \n1.f. April 2010 charges of DUI and DSL. Applicant asserts that these charges are \nthe same as those alleged in 1.e. The time difference between the two alleged dates is \nonly six days. He noted that during this period, he had no access to his vehicle, which \nhad been taken from him by the police. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 30, 39-40.) \n1.g. August 2016 charges of DUI, DSL, Spousal Battery, and maliciously/unlawfully \nremoving telephone. At the hearing Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR \nallegation by deleting the phrase \u201cmaliciously/unlawfully removed telephone\u201d on the \nground that this charge was part of the charges filed against Applicant and alleged in \nSOR 1.b, above, and was not a part of the 2016 charges.

He asserted that he has only had two DUIs \n(2008 and 2010) and the battery charge is a duplicate of the 2008 charge. At the hearing, \nApplicant denied the DUI charge, but admitted he was cited for DSL due to the lack of a \nrecord evidencing his completion of the court-ordered course that was part of his \nsentence for the 2010 DUI. He argued that his driver\u2019s license should never have been \nsuspended. He claimed that the DSL charge was withdrawn after he established that he \nhad completed the program by producing a duplicate of his certificate of completion. I find \nApplicant\u2019s testimony regarding the DSL charge to be credible and that the SOR \nallegation regarding other charges is based upon incorrect information. (Answer at 2; Tr. \nat 30, 40-45; GE 2 at 23; GE 7 at 4; GE 8 at 3, 21-24; GE 10 at 3.) \nApplicant has never received any in-patient treatment for alcohol abuse. He has \nnever been diagnosed with alcohol dependence or abuse. (Tr. at 45-46.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe details regarding the SOR allegations set forth in paragraph 2 are as follows: \n2.a. March 2000 Non-Judicial Punishment for testing positive for marijuana. \nApplicant was administratively discharged from the Navy under Other Than Honorable \nconditions as a result of failing a drug test on March 2, 2000. Applicant admitted this \nallegation. He commented that he was 19 years old at the time and was influenced by his \nfriends and peers. He regrets the choices he made at that time. (Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at 49-\n51; GE 6.)   \n2.b. Applicant used marijuana from 2000 until June 5, 2013. Applicant denied this \nallegation on the ground that the June 5, 2013 date is incorrect. That date is his official \n\u201cclean date\u201d for abstaining from both illegal drugs and alcohol. His last use of marijuana \nwas in 2012, the year in which he gained custody of two of his children. The information \nin the report of his background interview about drug use until June 2013 is the result of a \nmisunderstanding by the investigator. That date only applies to his last use of alcohol. \n(Answer at 2, 5; Tr. at 50-51; GE 2 at 20, 23.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe SOR sets forth three allegations of omissions in Applicant\u2019s e-QIP that \nresulted in false answers. The details regarding the SOR falsification allegations set forth \nin this paragraph and Applicant\u2019s responses are as follows: \n3.a. Failure to disclose his use of marijuana in the seven years preceding April \n2019 in his response to Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs in the e-QIP. Applicant ceased \nusing marijuana in 2012 when he was granted full physical custody of two of his children. \nHe understood that responsibility required him to be drug-free. He did not list his last use \nof marijuana sometime in 2012 because it was about seven years prior to the date of his \ne-QIP and disclosure was not required under the question\u2019s seven-year time limitation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe credibly testified that the information in GE 2 regarding drug use until June 5, 2013, is \na misunderstanding.

Failure to disclose in his response to Section 22 - Police Record all of his \noffenses involving alcohol and drug use during the period 2000 to August 2016 and an \nalleged felony charge. Applicant was never charged with a felony, so he had nothing to \nreport in response to the e-QIP question regarding past felony charges. The same is true \nwith respect to the alleged 2016 DUI. Applicant disclosed his 2010 DUI arrest in response \nto Section 22, and in response to Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, he disclosed the DUI \noffenders program he was ordered to take. He failed to respond correctly to a follow-up \nquestion in Section 22 that asks for other instances of certain types of charges including \nalcohol and drugs. As a result, he failed to list his 2008 DUI charge and his 2000 NJPs \nfor alcohol intoxication and drug use. He failed to list these incidents due to \nmisunderstanding the question and acknowledges that he answered the question \nincorrectly. He said that he filled out the questionnaire, which he described as lengthy, \nafter a long day of work, and he did not clearly understand the question. He credibly \ntestified that he had no intention to mislead the Government or to withhold this derogatory \ninformation from many years ago. In his background interview, he volunteered the \ninformation regarding 2008 DUI before being confronted. (Tr. at 54-57; GE 1 at 31-32, \n33-34; GE 2 at 7, 10.) \n3.c. Failure to disclose his delinquent debts incurred in the seven years preceding \nApril 2019 in his response to Section 26 \u2013 Financial Record. Applicant credibly testified \nthat he failed to disclose his delinquent debts and repossessed vehicle due to oversight. \nHe acknowledged that he answered the question incorrectly. He said he was not prepared \nto respond to these detailed financial questions. He did not have a credit report at the \ntime he prepared his responses to the e-QIP questions, and he mistakenly did not \ndisclose certain debts in response to the questions. He had no intention to mislead the \nGovernment about his debts. In his July 2019 background interview, Applicant discussed \nhis debts at length indicating that he had no intent to shield information from the \nGovernment in his e-QIP. (Tr. at 55, 57-58; GE 2 at 10-18.) \nParagraph 4 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nidentifies eight past-due debts that have been referred to collection or charged off. The \ndebts total about $23,000.

Credit union account charged off in the amount of $14,888. This debt is a \nvehicle loan account. Applicant defaulted on paying the monthly loan payments in 2016 \nduring a period of unemployment from August 2016 to September 2017.. In 2020 he \nentered into a payment plan agreement with the creditor and has been paying this account \nmonthly. GE 3 and 4 confirm that Applicant is \u201cpaying under a partial payment \nagreement.\u201d This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 59-60; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4.) \n4.b. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $1,263. Applicant \npaid this debt after his July 2019 background interview, possibly in 2020. He does not \nhave a receipt. The account does not appear on the most recent credit report in the \nrecord, dated March 31, 2022. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 3; GE 4 at 2; GE \n5 at 6.) \n4.c. Credit account in collection in the approximate amount of $878. The original \ncreditor on this account is the same creditor as the one listed in 4.b, above. Applicant \ntestified that he only had one account with this creditor. In 2021 he disputed this debt with \nthe credit bureaus. He believes his dispute is still under investigation. He provided no \nevidence regarding the dispute. The credit reports in the record do not reflect that this \ndebt is disputed. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 61-62; GE 4 at 2.) \n4.d. Collection account in the approximate amount of $593. This account was \noriginally a credit-card account. Applicant paid this debt in May 2021. He provided proof \nof payment of the debt. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 62-63; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at \n12; AE C.) \n4.e. Payday loan account in collection in the approximate amount of $315. This \naccount became delinquent after Applicant prepared his e-QIP. Applicant paid this debt \nin late 2020 or early 2021. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. at 63; GE 2 at 11; GE 4 at \n3; GE 5 at 12.) \n4.f. Credit union account in collection in the approximate amount of $815. Applicant \ndefaulted on paying this credit-card account in late 2016 or early 2017 when he was \nunemployed. Applicant settled this debt for less than the full balance, as evidenced by a \ncredit report in the record, dated January 5, 2021 (GE 4). The settlement was paid in June \n2020. Applicant provided proof of the resolution of this debt. This debt has been resolved. \n(Tr. at 63; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 5; AE B.) \n4.g. Collection account in the approximate amount of $4,516. Applicant disputed \nthis account in about April 2021 because he does not know what it is. The dispute is \nconfirmed by the Government\u2019s March 31, 2022 credit report in the record (GE 3). \nApplicant called the original creditor identified in his credit report (Creditor A) and learned \nthat it is an online lender. He claimed that he has never taken out a loan from Creditor A. \nHis dispute has not been resolved.

This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. at 64; GE 2 at 16; GE 3 at 5; GE 5 at 4.) \n4.h. Medical account in the approximate amount of $294. Applicant does not \nrecognize this debt. He insists that in 2019 and 2020 he had a state-funded medical \ninsurance policy for low-income families that has no co-pays. The date on which Applicant \nbecame delinquent on this account is not apparent in the Government\u2019s credit reports and \nit only appears on the oldest report, dated May 11, 2019. Applicant has reviewed his \nrecent credit report and this debt does not appear on it. He has not taken any action to \ndispute this debt. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. at 64; GE 2 at 11; GE 5 at 12.) \nMitigation \nApplicant summarized his life\u2019s journey in a brief statement (AE K). He \nacknowledged his history of misconduct when he was young and irresponsible. He also \nadmitted that he has a history of losing jobs and encountering financial difficulties. He \nwrote that he began to change his ways when he was granted full physical custody of two \nof his children in 2012. In that year he stopped using illegal drugs, i.e., marijuana. In 2013 \nhe ceased drinking alcohol so that he could become a better father. He joined a church \nthat has become central to his life along with his family. Now he is married at age 41. He \nworks on improving his character and being a better husband and father. He has been an \nactive participant in Narcotics Anonymous (NA) for over 8 years and has worked all of the \nsteps. He has been sober since June 2013. He has a support group as part of NA that is \nimportant to him. His most important supporter is his wife. He has made a serious \ncommitment to himself and his family to provide his children with a better life. His children \nhave successfully developed into responsible individuals. His oldest is attending college \nstudying civil engineering, and the younger ones are excelling as well. (Tr. at 48, AE K.) \nApplicant provided character letters from senior managers, supervisors, and co\u00ad\nworkers at his place of employment and from his church pastor and assistant pastor. They \nall describe Applicant in glowing terms and remark how he matured and devoted himself \nto his wife and family and to his church. His pastor wrote that Applicant has \u201ccompletely \nturn[ed] his life around\u201d and has \u201cgrown emotionally, mentally and spiritually.\u201d The \nchurch\u2019s assistant pastor commented that Applicant takes \u201cfull responsibility for his past\u201d \nand now is one of the pastors \u201cmust trusted and faithful friends.\u201d At work, he is described \nas \u201cdedicated, hardworking, and possess[ing] a can do spirit.\u201d He is praised for his work \nethic, reliability, honesty, integrity, and positive attitude, as well as his professionalism. \n(AE D through J and L.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply to the facts \nof this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s two DUI convictions (SOR 1.c and 1.e), his first NJP for intoxication \n(SOR 1.a) and his past excessive drinking habits (e.g., SOR 1.b) establish the above \npotentially disqualifying conditions and shift the burden of mitigation to Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 23 sets forth the following four mitigating conditions under Guideline G that \nhave possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nAll of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant has been sober since \n2013. He has acknowledged his past abuse of alcohol and has taken control of his \nproblem with the help of NA and his church and family. He continues to participate in a \ntreatment program on a regular basis and he completed a court-ordered 18-month \nprogram. He views his sobriety as a solemn commitment to his family to do better \npersonally and to give them a better life. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his testimony regarding his history of \ndrug use establish both of the above disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to \nApplicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence. \nApplicant has fully established both mitigating conditions. His last use of marijuana \nwas in 2012. He has acknowledged his drug involvement, provided evidence of his \nextensive activities with NA to overcome the problem and has established a ten-year \npattern of abstinence. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nApplicant convincingly testified that the omissions he made in his e-QIP were not \ndeliberate. The questions he made mistakes on are not short, simple questions. They are \nlengthy and have many subparts with different time frames for different sets of questions. \nHe has a high school diploma and attended a technical school after that education. He \nworks with his hands performing hard manual labor. It is readily understandable that the \n40-page questionnaire was somewhat overwhelming. More importantly, Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony and character evidence convincingly shows him as a person of serious integrity \nand honesty who has committed himself to doing the right thing. He had nothing to gain \nby omitting drug use in 2000 or an NJP involving alcohol in 2000. The record evidence \ndoes not establish that he has ever been charged with a felony. Accordingly, he had \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \nnothing to report in response to that important specific question in the e-QIP. His most \nserious mistake was not disclosing his debts. But even with that omission, I believe \nApplicant did not intend to deliberately withhold derogatory information from the \nGovernment. At the time he filled out the e-QIP, he was simply unprepared to provide \nanswers to questions that call for detailed responses about his personal finances that \nwere less than perfect due to past periods of unemployment. \nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s omissions in the e-QIP might be deemed to be \ndeliberate, it is necessary to review the mitigating conditions. The guideline includes two \nconditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s \nalleged falsifications: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGE 2 clearly reflects that Applicant volunteered information about his first DUI in \n2008 before being confronted with information about it. He made a prompt good faith-\neffort to correct the omission of information about a prior DUI in his e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s \ndisclosure of his 2010 DUI in his e-QIP is significant because it was his second DUI and \nhe was still on probation from the first one. His voluntary disclosure of the 2008 DUI in his \ninterview reveals his intent to be forthcoming about potentially serious derogatory \ninformation from his past. AG 17(a) has been established with respect to this arguably \nmaterial omission in his e-QIP. \nThe remaining omissions of Applicant\u2019s 2000 NJP for alcohol intoxication while on \nduty, the 2000 NJP for marijuana use, and the more recent financial debts are all relatively \nminor in the context of a person who has conquered a serious history of alcohol and drug \nabuse and a financial history plagued with job losses and unemployment. His life is on \nthe right track. With his multiple support systems in place, his past is unlikely to recur. His \ne-QIP omissions were innocent mistakes. Applicant is no longer the sort of person he \nonce was. Today, he obeys the rules and takes his responsibilities seriously. He now \nunderstands the seriousness and importance of preparing a security clearance \napplication accurately to the best of his abilities. The omissions in his e-QIP do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG 17(c) applies. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAs of the date of the SOR, Applicant owed approximately $23,000 for eight past-\ndue debts, including one automobile repossession. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit \nreports in the record establish the existence of these debts and the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation renders the above conditions fully applicable. He \nhas resolved or has been paying monthly pursuant to a payment plan to resolve all of the \nSOR with three exceptions (4.c - $878; 4.g - $4,516; and 4.h - $294), which Applicant \ndisputes. The debts arose some time ago during periods of unemployment, and Applicant \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances by entering into a good-faith effort to \nresolve the five debts he does not presently dispute. In light of Applicant\u2019s responsible \nbehavior with the debts he acknowledges, I am confident that he will resolve any of the \ndisputed debts should one or more of them be established as legitimate. Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines \nG, H, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Further comments are warranted. When \nApplicant was growing up, he could never have imagined that he would become a drug-\nfree and alcohol-free, responsible parent and husband earning a good living working in a \nstable job as a contractor for the U.S military. He had the strength of character to realize \nhe needed to change the direction of his life and began voluntarily participating with NA. \nHe stopped using drugs and then he stopped drinking alcohol. He became engaged in \nhis church and found a partner he wanted to marry and help raise her two children. He \nhas responsibly resolved his history of alcohol and drug abuse, and he is paying his \ndelinquent debts that arose due to periods of unemployment. He did not provide certain \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation in his e-QIP, but he did alert the Government about his most recent DUI in \n2010 and his discharge from the Navy under Other Than Honorable conditions after 15 \nmonths of service. He did not intentionally omit other information in his e-QIP that was of \nless security significance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a through 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a through 4.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant admitted this allegation. He reiterated that he accepts responsibility for \nhis tax returns not being filed in a timely manner. He explained that his wife was \nsupposed to be working with a neighbor to prepare their tax returns, but that did not \nhappen. When asked about his wife\u2019s response regarding their tax returns, he stated, \n\u201cWhen the wife shrugs her shoulders, it\u2019s hard for me to respond. So I would say, no, I \nwas not aware.\u201d (Tr. 20-21, 27) \nApplicant submitted IRS transcripts for the respective tax years in question. For \ntax year 2015, the IRS received his tax return on April 10, 2017. For tax year, 2016, the \nIRS received his tax return on September 2, 2018.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe record evidence establishes concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nFurther review is required. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists the following potential mitigating conditions: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

There is more than one delinquent debt and Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not \nisolated. His Federal tax debt remains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). \nPer Applicant, his Federal and state income tax problems were caused by an \nongoing breakdown in communications with his wife. He first became aware that he had \nincome tax problems when he completed his May 26, 2017 SF-86 and made inquiries \nwith his wife about their tax status. For the tax years in question, Applicant\u2019s wife \naccepted responsibility in their family for filing their income tax returns and paying their \ntaxes. That did not happen. However, Applicant realizes that he bears responsibility for \nthe hands-off approach he took vis-\u00e0-vis his taxes. He understands he has a statutory \nresponsibility to timely file his tax returns. \nWith that said, beginning with tax year 2018 and moving forward, Applicant has \ntaken a more proactive role in ensuring that his Federal and state income tax returns \nhave been filed and taxes paid in a timely manner. All of his delinquent Federal and \nstate income tax returns that were alleged in his SOR have been filed. All of his \ndelinquent Federal and state income taxes have been paid except for tax year 2017. \nFor tax year 2017, he owes approximately $12,477 on an original balance of $19,124. \nApplicant set up a payment plan in January 2021 with the IRS to pay $200 a month. The \nevidence he submitted substantiates that his monthly payments more often than not \nexceed that amount. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are fully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant or continue national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

He has security clearance \nexperience going back to his first security clearance received in 2009. He is married and \nhas three children. He is the primary income earner in the household. Apart from the \nSOR allegations that dealt with his tax problems, Applicant has been a responsible \ncitizen and member of his community. Furthermore, he is a valued and trusted \nemployee who is making a contribution to the national defense. \nThis case is somewhat out of the ordinary involving an individual who, for the \nbetter part of his adult life, filed his Federal and state income returns and paid his taxes \nin a timely manner. The dilemma involving his taxes appears to stem from a relatively \nrecent breakdown in communication, and apparent lack of cooperation, that existed \nbetween Applicant and his wife. The difficulties Applicant experienced with his spouse \nover their taxes have been resolved, beginning in 2018 and onward. What remains for \nApplicant is to continue making his monthly payments to the IRS to pay down his \nFederal tax arrearage. Applicant fully understands the fallout that can occur when one \nfails to live up to their responsibility as a citizen to timely file their Federal and state \nincome tax returns and pay any taxes owed. To that end, he has taken a much more \n\u201chands on\u201d approach when it comes to taxes and managing the household budget. This \nexperience has not been lost on Applicant, especially for someone whose continued \nlivelihood is dependent on maintaining a security clearance. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. National security eligibility is granted. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2007 through 2013 (\u00b6 1.a); that she is indebted to the IRS for delinquent taxes for TY 2008, totaling $5,411 (\u00b6 1.b); for TY 2009, totaling $6,284 (\u00b6 1.c); for TY 2011, totaling $4,605 (\u00b6 1.d); for TY 2012, totaling $4,432 (\u00b6 1.e); and that she is indebted to the Federal Government for a tax lien entered against her in August 2016 for about $22,025 (\u00b6 1.f). In her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations without comment, except for SOR \u00b6 1.f, which she admitted and stated that she was working with a tax-relief company to establish a payment plan with the IRS. Her admission is accepted as a finding of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 69 years old. She has been married twice. She married her current husband in 1993, and she has one adult son. Applicant has been working as a truck driver for at least five different companies from 2006 to present. Her employment history indicates no periods of unemployment or underemployment.

(FORM, Item 9) Applicant was informed she could object to \nthe summary of her interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or that she \ncould make corrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make it \naccurate.

Applicant did not respond to the FORM. Without objections, I \nadmitted and considered all of the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax \nyears (TY) 2007 through 2013 (\u00b6 1.a); that she is indebted to the IRS for delinquent \ntaxes for TY 2008, totaling $5,411 (\u00b6 1.b); for TY 2009, totaling $6,284 (\u00b6 1.c); for TY \n2011, totaling $4,605 (\u00b6 1.d); for TY 2012, totaling $4,432 (\u00b6 1.e); and that she is \nindebted to the Federal Government for a tax lien entered against her in August 2016 \nfor about $22,025 (\u00b6 1.f). \nIn her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations without \ncomment, except for SOR \u00b6 1.f, which she admitted and stated that she was working \nwith a tax-relief company to establish a payment plan with the IRS. Her admission is \naccepted as a finding of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 69 years old. She has been married twice. She married her current \nhusband in 1993, and she has one adult son. Applicant has been working as a truck \ndriver for at least five different companies from 2006 to present. Her employment history \nindicates no periods of unemployment or underemployment. Apparently, she has been \nworking for the current employer since 2012. She is being sponsored for eligibility for a \nclearance by a federal contractor.

She also failed to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for TYs 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. She stated that her \nfailure to timely file income tax returns and to pay her taxes when due resulted from her \ninability to get all her tax documents, lack of information or lost documents; and her \ninability to find help to complete the income tax returns. She also disclosed that the IRS \nplaced a $20,000 lien against her home in 2016. She averred she hired a tax-relief \ncompany to help her negotiate with the IRS and establish a payment plan. \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator in December 2018. She told \nthe investigator that she did not file her TY 2007 income tax return until 2013, because \nshe was travelling frequently and had personal problems. She did not file her TY 2008 \nincome tax return until February 2014. As of the day of her interview (December 2018), \nshe had not started to pay her 2008 delinquent taxes, about $4,000. As of May 11, \n2020, she owed the IRS $5,411 for TY 2008. Applicant did not timely file her TY 2009 \nincome tax return. As of December 2018, she had not started to pay her 2009 \ndelinquent taxes, about $6,000. As of May 11, 2020, she owed the IRS $6,284 for TY \n2009. (Item (9) \nApplicant stated she did not file her 2010 income tax return because she did not \nhave the paperwork needed. She indicated she needed to call the IRS to get more \ninformation about her TY 2010 taxes. She filed late her TY 2011, 2012, and 2013 \nincome tax returns. She believed she owed back taxes for 2011, 2012, and 2013, but \nshe was not sure how much she owed. As of May 11, 2020, she owed the IRS $4,605 \nfor TY 2011, and $4,432 for TY 2012. In 2011, Applicant earned $114,604, and received \nan IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) for $1,668. (Item 8) \nApplicant stated she retained the services of a tax-relief company and was \nwaiting for the company to settle with the IRS and establish a payment plan on her \nbehalf so that she could start making tax payments. She averred she timely filed her TY \n2014 through 2017 income tax returns. (Items 8 and 9) She failed to submit \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate her claims about retaining a company to help her \nnegotiate with the IRS, and that she timely filed her TY 2014 through 2017 income tax \nreturns. \nAll of the SOR allegations are established by the documents in evidence, \nincluding Applicant\u2019s SOR admission, her statement to an OPM investigator during her \n2018 interview, and her answers to the DOHA interrogatory. (FORM, Items 2, 8, and 9) \nApplicant failed to submit sufficient documentary evidence about her efforts to \ncontact the IRS, of any payment agreements established, of any payments made to the \nIRS for taxes owed for TYs 2007 to present, or of having retained the services of a tax \nresolution company to assist her with her IRS tax problems.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. As alleged in the \nSOR, she failed to timely file federal income tax returns for TYs 2007 through 2013 (\u00b6 \n1.a); she is indebted to the IRS for delinquent taxes for TY 2008, totaling $5,411 (\u00b6 1.b); \nfor TY 2009, totaling $6,284 (\u00b6 1.c); for TY 2011, totaling $4,605 (\u00b6 1.d); for TY 2012, \ntotaling $4,432 (\u00b6 1.e); and she is indebted to the IRS for a tax lien entered against her \nin August 2016 for about $22,025 (\u00b6 1.f). Applicant presented no documentary evidence \nof any good-faith efforts on her part to pay, settle, or resolve her tax debts. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant explained she did not timely file her TYs 2007 through 2013 income tax \nreturn for several reasons: she was travelling frequently and had personal problems; \nshe did not have the paperwork needed; she needed information from the IRS; and she \nwas waiting for the tax-relief company she retained to settle with the IRS on her behalf \nand establish a payment plan so that she could start making her payments. \nShe failed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate her efforts to contact \nthe IRS, of any payment agreements established, of any payments made to the IRS for \ntaxes owed for TYs 2007 to present, or of having retained the services of a tax \nresolution company to assist her with her IRS tax problems. The SOR allegations are \nunresolved. She presented no evidence to show she has participated in financial \ncounseling. She did not present evidence of her and her spouse\u2019s current financial \nsituation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net \nremainder). Without any documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not \npossible for me to assess whether or not she is financially overextended. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were likely aggravated by her job as a truck driver \nwith limited time at home, and lack of access to her mail and documents.

She failed to submit evidence of her efforts to \ntimely file her income tax returns, of her contacts with the IRS to settle or establish \npayment agreements, or of any tax payments made since the taxes became due. She \nfailed to establish her good-faith efforts to resolve her delinquent tax filings, her \ndelinquent taxes, and that her financial situation is under control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn this instance, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial responsibility, and that her financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the future, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. In this case, Applicant failed to submit sufficient documentary \nevidence of her offers to resolve her tax problems. Additionally, she presented no \nevidence to show she has participated in financial counseling. She also did not present \nevidence of her current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly \nexpenses, and monthly net remainder). The financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 69, is a truck driver being sponsored by a federal contractor for a \nclearance. Her evidence is insufficient to establish that she has been financially \nresponsible by timely filing her income tax returns and timely paying her taxes as \nrequired. She failed to establish she has taken good-faith efforts to resolve her tax \nproblems. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401.

He stated that despite drinking, at the end of the evening \nhe thought that he was able to drive a short distance home. While driving home, he \nmissed his exit and got his car stuck in a grassy area. He claimed that he called the police \nfor assistance, which resulted in his arrest for DUI. He pled guilty, and had a restricted \nlicense for a year, an interlock device placed on his vehicle, 6 months of probation through \nthe state Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and 10 mandatory ASAP classes from \nabout March \u2013 August 2017. He successfully completed the ASAP classes and the terms \nof his sentence. He stated that his decision to drive that night was a mistake, and he is \nremorseful. After his arrest, he made changes to prevent future incidents, by leaving his \ncar at home and only using ride-share services for transportation if any alcohol was \ninvolved in work or personal social events. He also stopped drinking alcohol for about 9 \nmonths after his arrest. (Tr. 29-31, 35-36, 82; GE 3; AE A) \nFor about two years, Applicant had been successfully using ride-share services to \ntravel home after consuming alcohol. In October 2019, he had a scheduled dinner \nmeeting one evening after work. He stated that he had planned to drive home and take a \nride-share service to dinner. However, one of his employees asked to meet with him right \nafter work. He reported that meeting went longer than expected, and he was unable to go \nhome before leaving for his dinner meeting. He stated that the evening ended late, and \nhe had drank that night, but thought that he was safe to drive his car approximately three \nmiles home. He was stopped by police in a speed trap on the way home, and was arrested \nfor DUI.

After his arrest, he abstained \ncompletely from alcohol use from Oct 2019 to Jan 2021. He reported that he learned \ntechniques from Dr. G to handle any social pressure he felt to drink at work or personal \nsocial events. This included having a non-alcoholic drink in his hand at social functions. \nHe was also taught a method called \u201czero, one, two\u201d, which gave him an appropriate \nstrategy to handle any situations involving alcohol. He stated that he was not told that he \ncould never drink again, but rather the counseling focused on how to prevent a future \nrelapse to situations where there was excessive alcohol use. (Tr. 38-51, 59-60, 90-95; \nAE A, L, M) \nApplicant reported that he was ashamed of his DUI convictions, and he was not \nready to explain to colleagues and subordinates at work why he was no longer drinking. \nHe reported that after COVID-19 restrictions waned, he felt significant pressure at work \nand personal social events. He stated that from about spring 2021 to October 2021 he \nused the \u201czero, one, two\u201d method to give the impression that he was drinking, when he \ndid not want to consume alcoholic drinks. He stated that on a few occasions, he would \nhave an alcohol drink in his hand, from which he had a few sips over the course of an \nevening, to stave off questions about why he was not drinking. He left Employer A in May \n2021, which removed the pressure he felt to drink at work social events. Employer B\u2019s \nculture does not promote drinking. (Tr. 96-99, 101, 107-108; AE A) \nHis wife testified that after his second DUI, Applicant was ashamed and was not \nready to discuss his conviction with their social circle. She reported that when COVID \nprecautions loosened they started seeing friends again. To avoid questions about why he \nwas not drinking, on occasion he used the \u201czero, one, two\u201d method to give the impression \nthat he was consuming alcohol, when in reality he would have only a few sips of a drink \nover a long period of time. She stated that eventually pretending to drink was too stressful, \nand he just started telling their family and friends about why he stopped drinking. She \nstated that he found support and understanding, and became vocal with friends about the \ndangers of excessive drinking.

He has over 30 years \nof experience providing substance treatment, including in several military substance \nabuse programs, by serving as a treatment provider, supervisor, and clinical director on \na large military base.

He reported that \nhe expected that Applicant would effectively manage life stressors and social events \ninvolving alcohol use in the future. He had similar findings in reevaluations in December \n2021 and June 2022. He also conducted credibility assessments of Applicant along with \nhis evaluations, and believes that he was being honest. (Tr. 146-147, 184; GE 8; AE C, \nD) \nWhen he started counseling in 2019, Dr. G diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use \ndisorder - moderate, because he had reported a dysfunctional pattern of alcohol use. \nHowever, his current assessment of him is alcohol use disorder \u2013 moderate in sustained \nremission. Dr. G reported that in their counseling sessions, they dug into his patterns of \nbehavior involving alcohol use, and identified changes that he needed to make. While Dr. \nG prefers that his patients did not drink at all, he realizes that they need effective coping \nskills and strategies for life situations where alcohol is present. One of the skills he taught \nhim was the \u201czero, one, two\u201d method. He believes that Applicant\u2019s current work and social \nlife circumstances are healthier for him, as is his decision to stop drinking. He is not \nconcerned that Applicant will drive under the influence again. (Tr. 133-150, 150-185; AE \nG, L, M) \nThere are four character letters in the record from two of Applicant\u2019s friends, a \ncolleague, and his supervisor. Two have known him over 20 years. He is highly regarded \nand he is described as trustworthy, responsible, professional, committed to his family, \nand possessing good judgment. The writers have knowledge of his DUIs and challenges \nwith alcohol, and they have witnessed the positive life changes that he has made.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 details the personal conduct security concern: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for alcohol consumption under AG \n\u00b6 22 and the following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \n \nApplicant has 2016 and 2019 DUI arrests and convictions, and a 2019 assessment \nfor alcohol use disorder.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, \nand matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant has 2016 and 2019 DUI arrests and convictions, and is under \nsupervision from the state ASAP program until his license restriction is completed in about \nthree months.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered the testimony of his wife and Dr. G, his work \nperformance evaluations, and his letters of recommendation highlighting his character, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and \nJ in my whole-person analysis. \nI found Applicant\u2019s testimony to be credible. He was forthcoming with the reasons \nfor his problem with alcohol, and I found that his lifestyle changes were genuine and \nappropriate to address the concerns. The whole-person evidence clearly demonstrates \nthat Applicant is reliable, trustworthy and possesses good judgment. He is remorseful for \nhis past behavior. He has successfully navigated social pressures to consume alcohol, \nand found an appropriate way to inform family, friends, and colleagues about his past \nchallenges and current abstinence. He has a strong support system in place to ensure \nhis future success. He has clearly established that all of the security concerns have been \nmitigated by circumstances that are unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

On September 2, 2022, DOHA \nissued a notice scheduling the hearing for September 26, 2022, by video-teleconference \nthrough an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which I admitted without objection. Applicant provided \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were attached to her answer to the SOR. They \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant also testified. I held the record open until \nOctober 3, 2022, to give Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documents. She \ntimely submitted two documents, which I marked as AE C and AE D and admitted without \nobjection. The record closed on October 3, 2022. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on October 5, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, with brief explanations. Her admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. She has never married. She lives with her mother and \nher 20-year-old daughter. Her daughter had health issues last year so Applicant took time \noff from work to care for her. She was not able to find stable employment with a good \nincome so she could not pay her bills until recently. (Tr. 30-33, 39) \nApplicant disclosed details about her employment history on her SCA and \ndiscussed her employment history during her testimony. (GE 1; Tr. 24-50) After the \nhearing, she provided a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. (AE D) \nApplicant has spent many years as a cleared government contractor working with \na variety of federal agencies. She was a document manager for a contractor for about \nthree years, from 2007-2010. She was then laid off at the end of the contract and was \nunemployed for about a year, until May 2011. (GE 1) She then worked as an \nadministrative assistant, with a security clearance, for a government contractor from May \n2011 to March 2018, when her employer went out of business. She worked for another \ncontractor from March 2018 to July 2018 as a cleared escort into classified areas. She \nleft that job after a personality conflict with a supervisor. She then worked for a cleaning \ncompany, cleaning secured buildings, for about six months in late 2018, earning $25 an \nhour. (Tr. 40-47; GE 1; AE D) \nApplicant worked as an administrative specialist with another government agency \n(AGA) for most of 2019. She earned $22 an hour. She then worked as a contractor on an \nAir Force Base during 2020 and 2021, earning $31 an hour. She was under-employed \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic due to the limited need for on-site security. She worked \nfor the first six months of 2022 with a medical transport company at $15 an hour but was \nlaid off in July 2022. She was then unemployed until two weeks before the hearing, when \nshe began working for a large retailer. A prospective employer in the defense industry \nhas sponsored her for a clearance.

This would \nput her in better position to address her debts, though not all at once. (Tr. 24-30, 35-40) \nThe SOR allegations concern six delinquent debts, totaling about $50,200, and a \n2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The debts are established by credit reports from March 2019 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f) and January 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d), GE 3 and GE 4, respectively. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2011 during a period of \nunemployment after she was laid off at the end of an employment contract. She declared \n$37,000 in liabilities. Her debts were discharged in May 2011. (GE 5)(SOR \u00b6 1.g) \nOn her 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed some of her more recent debts and\nasserted that they were due to lack of work, resulting in financial hardship. (GE 1 at 32-\n34) She also discussed her debts and financial situation in her May 2019 background \ninterview. (GE 6) The debts are detailed as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($19,182) is a charged-off debt relating to an auto. In 2016, Applicant \npurchased a used luxury vehicle for about $30,000. The car was repossessed after about \ntwo years. The charged-off amount is what is owed on the vehicle after it was sold at \nauction. The creditor proposed a settlement amount of $13,000 but Applicant was unable \nto pay it. She has taken no further action. (Tr. 51-54; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4 at 3) The debt \nremains listed as charged off on a current credit report. (GE 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($2,726) is an account placed for collection. This debt concerns unpaid \nrent for an apartment where Applicant lived from May 2015 to July 2018, when she was \nevicted. The creditor initially worked with her to resolve the debt but it remains unpaid. \n(Tr. 54-55; GE 2; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($437) is a past-due medical debt owed to an unidentified creditor. \nApplicant said in her answer that she believes Medicaid should cover the debt. She does \nnot know what it is for. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4; Tr. 55) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($23,489) is a charged-off debt related to an auto repossession. \nApplicant opened the account in August 2014, she made the most recent payment in \nFebruary 2016, and it was reported in March 2021. Applicant has taken no action to \naddress the remaining debt owed. (GE 2; Tr. 56-57) While a recent credit report lists a \nzero balance, there is no indication that this is due to actions by Applicant. (GE 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($4,335) is a charged-off debt relating to lease-to-own home furniture. \nApplicant entered into the agreement in November 2017 and made one payment. She \ndid not return the furniture. She received a $2,000 settlement offer but was not able to \npay it. She has made no efforts to resolve the debt. (GE 4 at 4; Tr. 57-59) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($54) is a debt placed for collection by a power company. (GE 4) \nApplicant asserted that the debt is paid. After the hearing, she provided corroborating \ndocumentation. (Tr. 59-60, 71; AE C) This debt is resolved. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has lived with her mother since mid-2018. She pays $500 in rent to her \nmother (formerly $900 a month). Her mother is a retired federal employee, and she pays \nmost of the household expenses. (GE 1; Tr. 39-40, 70) Applicant said she is current on \nher taxes and has no other delinquent debts. She indicated no exorbitant expenses. She \ndoes not use a budget. (Tr. 66-68) \nApplicant has not participated in recent credit counseling, though she said she \nshould do so. At some point, she retained a debt-consolidation law firm, but they took \nsome of her money without taking action to address her debts. (Tr. 68-70) \nWith her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided two letters of recommendation, \nboth from former co-workers in cleared positions at government contractor jobs. Both \nreferences attest that she is knowledgeable, diligent, and a hard-working employee, as \nwell as honest, trustworthy, and dependable. She is also \u201ca joy to work with\u201d and a \u201cteam \nplayer.\u201d They recommend her for a security clearance. (AE A, AE B) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out, in pertinent part, in AG \n\u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. She filed for bankruptcy in 2011, \nand she is once again in financial difficulty. She has incurred various outstanding debts, \nincluding two recent repossessions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, and there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant has been gainfully employed by a variety of federal contractors in recent \nyears. She was underemployed in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, and she worked \na lower-paying job for the first six months of 2022. She was unemployed from July 2022 \nuntil two weeks before the hearing. This has limited her income, and, accordingly, she \nhas not been able to address her debts in a significant way. Her debts are therefore \nongoing, and continue to cast doubt on her current judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has experienced some employment instability and financial hardship, but \nshe also has a track record of spending beyond her means. She has limited her expenses \nby living with her mother for several years, but she has not addressed her debts in any \nreasonable or significant way. She has not participated in credit counseling and her debts \nare not being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant disputed and resolved the power company debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and provided \na reasonable explanation for the small medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). These debts are \nresolved under AG \u00b6 20(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s prior experience as a cleared employee of several \ngovernment contractors, but this does not outweigh the security concerns relating to her \nfinancial delinquencies, which remain ongoing. Applicant needs to address her debts in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \na responsible way by establishing a track record of steady payments towards her debts \nand a significant period of financial stability before she can again be considered eligible \nfor access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant did not mitigate \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 33, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting company, since June 2020. He completed a security clearance application in May 2020, disclosing three delinquent accounts. The ensuing background investigation revealed additional delinquent accounts. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to four creditors for approximately $28,405. (GE 3, AE A) Applicant\u2019s financial problems began after he graduated from college in May 2017. Initially, Applicant financed his education with student loans. He stopped attending college in 2012. When he returned to college between 2014 and 2017, he attended classes each spring semester, working construction jobs each summer and fall semester to save money for tuition. After graduation, Applicant continued to work construction jobs until January 2018. He was then unemployed for five months. He returned to construction work in June 2018, working laborer or construction foreman positions until he secured his first engineering job in February 2019. He secured his current position, a better paying one, in June 2020. (GE 3, AE A) The accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($13,632) and 1.c ($3,446) are for private student loans originated by the university he attended. He mistakenly thought these two loans were consolidated into his federal loans. Upon learning that they were not, he attempted to set up a payment plan in October 2019 for $100 per month.

Applicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by \nirresponsible or reckless financial behavior, but by underemployment in the two years \nafter he graduated from college. He has demonstrated a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 11, 2021, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017.

The Government submitted its written case on September \n9, 2021. The Government provided Applicant a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) and the Directive. He acknowledged receipt of the documents on \nSeptember 22, 2201, and provided a response. The attachments to the FORM are \nadmitted to the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. The documents \nappended to Applicant\u2019s response are admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through \nC. All documents were admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 10, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 33, has worked for his current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany, since June 2020. He completed a security clearance application in May 2020, \ndisclosing three delinquent accounts. The ensuing background investigation revealed \nadditional delinquent accounts. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to four \ncreditors for approximately $28,405. (GE 3, AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after he graduated from college in May \n2017. Initially, Applicant financed his education with student loans. He stopped \nattending college in 2012. When he returned to college between 2014 and 2017, he \nattended classes each spring semester, working construction jobs each summer and fall \nsemester to save money for tuition. After graduation, Applicant continued to work \nconstruction jobs until January 2018. He was then unemployed for five months. He \nreturned to construction work in June 2018, working laborer or construction foreman \npositions until he secured his first engineering job in February 2019. He secured his \ncurrent position, a better paying one, in June 2020. (GE 3, AE A) \nThe accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($13,632) and 1.c ($3,446) are for private \nstudent loans originated by the university he attended. He mistakenly thought these two \nloans were consolidated into his federal loans. Upon learning that they were not, he \nattempted to set up a payment plan in October 2019 for $100 per month. He could not \nmaintain the plan because he was unemployed. He contacted the university again in \nAugust 2020 to set up a payment plan, and learned that his loans were transferred to a \nlaw firm for collection. He setup a payment plan with the law firm in June 2021, agreeing \nto make a down payment of $1,500 followed by $300 each month. He paid the down \npayment in June 2021 and provided evidence with his September 2021 FORM \nresponse that he made the July and August payments. (GE 2, AE B) \nThe account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,837) is for a credit card that he used for \nemergencies and living expenses. Applicant has made 72 of 96 payments on his \nestablished payment plan, totaling $3,600. The two remaining debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($300) \nand 1.e ($160) were resolved by Applicant in June 2021 and July 2020, respectively. In \naddition to the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant also paid the charged-off $2,822 \ncredit card debt he disclosed on his security clearance application.

The most \nrecent credit report in the record, dated September 2021, shows no new delinquent \naccounts and that he is living within his financial means. (GE 4, AE A) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $28,000 \non five delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports in the record \nestablish the Government\u2019s prima facie case. The following disqualifying conditions \napply: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has provided sufficient information to mitigate the concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by irresponsible \nfinancial behaviors, but two years of underemployment after he graduated from college \nin May 2017. Applicant has taken steps to repay his delinquent accounts. He \nestablished a payment plan for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and has \nresolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. He has also resolved a charged-off \ncredit card not alleged in the SOR. To date, Applicant has paid more than $8,000 \ntoward his delinquent debt. The most recent credit report in the record does not reveal \nany new delinquent accounts or concerns about Applicant\u2019s current finances. The \nfollowing mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has established a track record of debt repayment. \nHe has also shown that since being fully employed in his field, he is able to live within \nhis means and not incur any additional delinquent debt. The AGs do not require an \napplicant to immediately resolve or pay each and every debt alleged in the SOR, to be \ndebt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the SOR. An applicant needs only to \nestablish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement \nthe plan. Applicant has implemented a plan to resolve his financial problems and he has \nmade substantial progress implementing his plan. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of June 11, 2021, Applicant owed two judgment debts of $45,778 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $3,189 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); five collection debts totaling $33,264 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e and 1.g-1.h); and two charged-off debts totaling $5,060 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i). When Applicant answered the SOR, she admitted all the debts without explanation. I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant was indebted on the accounts.

Applicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate who has worked as an administrative aide for a defense contractor since August 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 40.) She initially worked in a secure area but was moved when the SOR was issued. (Tr. 32-33.) She does not need a security clearance in her current position. (Tr. 33.)

The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn June 18, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record without a hearing.

I \naccept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant was indebted on the accounts. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate who has worked as an \nadministrative aide for a defense contractor since August 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 40.) She \ninitially worked in a secure area but was moved when the SOR was issued. (Tr. 32-33.) \nShe does not need a security clearance in her current position. (Tr. 33.) \nApplicant was married to her first husband for less than two years in the mid-1990s. \nShe and her current husband married in September 1997. They have a 21-year-old son \nand a 23-year-old daughter. (GE 1.) \nWhen their children were young, Applicant\u2019s husband had a very successful \ncommercial real estate appraisal company in her hometown in state A, and they were able \nto save money. Around 2006, they moved to state B, and he continued to operate his \nbusiness long distance. Following the real estate crash in state A, they moved back to state \nA, but stayed only nine months because their children disliked it so much. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse closed his business, and they returned to State B. (Tr. 55-56.) They used all of \ntheir retirement assets, $161,000, to purchase and open a coffee house and tea room in \nMay 2010. (Tr. 24, 62.)

(Tr. 24.) Applicant and her spouse paid for business \nsupplies and other bills, except payroll, using Applicant\u2019s personal credit-card accounts. \n(Tr. 51.) In January 2015, they opened a second coffee shop. (Tr. 57.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \ngot a job at $55,000 a year where he could work at their new coffee shop while also \nworking for his new employer. (Tr. 57.) Their primary location never regained its initial \npopularity. Applicant and her spouse adjusted spending by closing the shops during the \nwinter months when customer traffic was low, but they struggled to pay expenses. In the \nsummer of 2016, another competitor opened, which led to a further decline in customers. \nBy the time they closed the business in November 2016, Applicant was seriously in debt on \nseveral credit-card accounts. (GEs 1-6; Tr. 26, 49.) They now realize that they should have \nclosed the business six months earlier than they did. (Tr. 26.) Their vendor bills exceeded \nthe business income. (Tr. 48.) They considered but ruled out a bankruptcy filing because \nthey did not want to jeopardize their children\u2019s ability to obtain federal student loans. (Tr. \n58.) \nApplicant worked in retail from November 2016 until April 2017, when the store \nlocation where she worked closed due to decreased revenues. She then worked at a call \ncenter from May 2017 to August 2020, booking hotel reservations on commission and \nbeing paid a small hourly wage. (GE 6; Tr. 50.) She earned more in commission during the \nsummers, about $6,000 in commissions. (Tr. 50.) Her spouse started over in the banking \nindustry around that time. (Tr. 50.) \nOn May 5, 2020, Applicant completed, and certified as accurate, a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an SF 86 financial record inquiry into \nany delinquency involving enforcement, Applicant seriously underreported that she owed \nonly an estimated $50 on the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.a. She explained that she and \nher spouse took on debt for two coffee shops that they had to close due to market \nconditions and new competition, and that while they had taken out debt \u201cunder the name of \nthe company,\u201d they did not realize that they were personally liable for the debts incurred for \nthe business. She added, \u201cno court is involved. I am not sure I even have a judgment \nagainst me.\u201d She listed two accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) in response to SF 86 inquiries \ninto any delinquency involving routine accounts, but indicated that she owed only $50 on \neach account. She gave as the reason for the financial issue that she and her spouse \ncould not file for bankruptcy as it would affect their children\u2019s chances of obtaining student \nloans for college. Applicant reported no other debts on her SF 86. (GE 1.) \nCourt records reflect that, as of January 2017, Applicant owed $45,777 on the \ncredit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.a. When asked about the discrepancy between the $50 \nbalance reported on her SF 86 and the actual balance, Applicant testified that she thought \nshe owed less. (Tr. 37.) In May 2017, the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a obtained a \ndefault judgment against her for $46,217. The account had been opened in the name of \nher coffee shop with Applicant named as a cardholder. The card was intended to be used \nfor the company\u2019s commercial or business purposes. Under the terms of the agreement, \nApplicant was jointly and severally liable to repay the charges incurred on the account.

(GE 5.)  \nIn late April 2018, the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b filed for a small claims \njudgment against Applicant in the amount of $3,188.

She explained that when she and her spouse \nmade the difficult decision to close their coffee shops, they offered to make payments to \nher creditors, but each wanted $300 monthly payments, which they could not afford so they \nmade no payments. She acknowledged that she had received notice of the two court \njudgments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), and explained that she did not know the account \nbalances when she completed her SF 86. Her credit report was then reviewed. She did not \ndispute the reported delinquencies, which she asserted had been used in operating the \nbusiness. When confronted with the $319 retail credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i), Applicant \nstated that she had an account with the creditor, but she did not realize it was in \ncollections. She indicated that she would look into the debt and pay it. She related that she \ndid not want the debts to adversely affect her security clearance eligibility or her ability to \nobtain employment with the defense contractor, so she would contact her creditors and \nbegin making payments of approximately $50 on each account. (GE 6.) \nSometime in 2020, after her OPM interview, Applicant and her spouse looked into \nrepaying the debts incurred for their failed business through a debt-repayment plan with a \ndebt-relief company, but they could not afford the $1,400 monthly payment required under \nthe plan, so they did not start the process. (Tr. 28, 43-44.) \nApplicant began working for her defense-contractor employer in August 2020. In \nSeptember 2020, she finished paying off a $34,901 car loan obtained in May 2015. She \nhad no delinquent debts on her credit report apart from the SOR accounts. (GE 3.) \nBetween 2017 and 2022, Applicant and her spouse obtained about $185,000 in \nParent Plus student loans for their children\u2019s educations. (Tr. 27, 34, 45.)

(Tr. 45.) In late \nDecember 2020 or early January 2021, Applicant\u2019s spouse purchased the home that they \nhad been renting for seven years. The purchase price for the home and amount of the \ninitial mortgage loan are not in evidence. In January 2022, he refinanced the mortgage, \nwhich is in his name only, taking on a new loan for $420,000. The monthly mortgage \npayment is about $3,597. (Tr. 59-61.) He used the equity in their home to pay off all of the \nParents Plus loans taken out for their daughter\u2019s education; some of their son\u2019s student \nloans; a vehicle lease; and a car loan for an older, 2015 model-year Jeep. (Tr. 29-30, 59-\n61.) As to why they did not use some of the equity to make payments on the SOR debts, \nApplicant responded, \u201cI was just hoping it would just go away.\u201d (Tr. 36.) \nAt her hearing, Applicant exhibited little knowledge of the details of her and her \nspouse\u2019s financial affairs. Her spouse handles their household finances. (Tr. 30, 42.) His \nannual salary is $120,000. (Tr. 62.) Applicant currently earns almost $25 an hour and takes \nhome $688 per week. (Tr. 40.) Since January 2021, they have had about $500 a month in \ndiscretionary household income after paying their expenses. (Tr. 64-65.) Applicant still \nreceives collection notices from some of the SOR creditors, which she and her spouse \nignore. (Tr. 66-67.) As to why they did not use some of their monthly discretionary income \nto pay off her old debts, Applicant\u2019s spouse testified, \u201cI see those very old debts as \nsomething that will eventually go away.\u201d (Tr. 65.) Applicant has $11,000 and her spouse \nhas $25,000 in their respective 401(k) accounts. (Tr. 62.) He has a side business in \ncommercial real estate, and, over the past year, he obtained two economic industry \ndisaster loans for $3,000 to $4,000. He still has most of that money in a bank account. (Tr. \n63.) He was not asked about, and did not volunteer any details about, his income from his \nside business. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant defaulted on more than $87,000 in credit \ndebt. While most of the debt was incurred for the operation of her and her spouse\u2019s failed \ncoffee shop business, the $319 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i was on Applicant\u2019s personal credit-card \naccount with a retailer. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \nAG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d \nwarrants some discussion. After her March 2020 OPM interview, Applicant looked into \nconsolidating her delinquent debts through a debt-repayment plan, but she did not follow \nthrough because she could not afford to make the $1,400 monthly payments that \napparently would have been required at the time. However, AG \u00b6 19(b) applies to her more \nrecent and ongoing disregard of her debt-repayment obligations. She has continued to \nreceive, and ignore, debt-collection notices from her creditors. She admitted at her hearing \nthat she hoped the delinquent debts incurred for her and her spouse\u2019s business \u201cwould just \ngo away.\u201d \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by the delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The \nfollowing may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR accounts were charged off or placed for collection between 2017 and \n2018. While the debts were not incurred recently, an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-\n03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. \nNov. 3, 2017). AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though the business \ncircumstances that led her to incur the debt may not recur. \nThe business downturn Applicant and her spouse experienced in 2015 and 2016, \ncaused in part by unforeseen competition, is a mitigating condition that triggers AG \u00b6 20(b). \nEven so, Applicant exercised questionable financial judgment in some aspects with regard \nto the business. She and her spouse used all of their retirement money to open the \nbusiness. When she opened the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.a, she agreed to be jointly \nand severally liable for all of the charges incurred on the account. She used her personal \ncredit cards to pay vendors. She and her spouse opened a second coffee shop in 2015, \nwhich meant more expenses for their business. They kept the business open for at least \nsix months longer than they should have. \nThese questionable business decisions aside, for full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant is required to have acted responsibly under her circumstances. A component of \nfinancially responsible behavior is whether Applicant took timely steps to work with her \ncreditors toward resolving or settling her financial issues, and evidence in that regard is \nlimited. She looked into a debt-repayment plan that she did not pursue. Her ongoing \ndisregard of the SOR debts is inconsistent with the good judgment that must be expected \nof persons granted security clearance eligibility. \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) has been satisfied. None of the SOR debts have \nbeen resolved. Applicant listed only two past-due accounts when she completed her SF 86. \nShe inexplicably indicated on her SF 86 that she owed $50 on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nwhen a judgment had been awarded for $46,217. She did not dispute the debt balances \nlisted on her credit report when confronted during her OPM interview, and stated that she \nwould contact her creditors and start making $50 payments on each account. Court \nrecords show that she paid about $3,900 toward the judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a before \ndefaulting on her court-ordered payments. The latest credit report in the record shows a \n$41,877 balance on the debt. The account in SOR \u00b6 1.g, which was placed for collection \nfor $1,412, had a balance of $1,377 as of February 2021, so she may well have made a \nfew payments on that debt after it was assigned for collection. However, no progress has \nbeen shown on that debt or on the other SOR accounts since the SOR was issued. \nThe Appeal Board has held that the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to \nhis or her fitness or suitability to handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). The Appeal Board has also held that an \napplicant must demonstrate \u201ca plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitant \nconduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP \nCase No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018). While this can be read as requiring debt repayment for \nmitigation, it is consistent with the Appeal Board position in ISCR Case No. 09-02160 in \nthat a person who ignores legitimate financial obligations without reasonable justification \ndoes not display the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of person\u2019s \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s sensitive information. \nApplicant exhibited some financial naivet\u00e9, such as not realizing that she was \npersonally liable for the debts incurred for her business. Her spouse continues to handle \ntheir household finances. Even so, while it may be common for one spouse to handle all of \nthe bills in a household, Applicant remains largely ignorant of her financial situation at peril \nto her security clearance eligibility. She and her spouse chose to not file for bankruptcy, not \nbecause she wanted to take responsibility for her debts, but because they did not want to \njeopardize their children\u2019s eligibilities for student loans. Her spouse refinanced the \nmortgage on their home in January 2022, taking on a loan for $420,000, but they used the \nequity to pay off student loans and a car instead of making payments on the SOR debts. \nApplicant\u2019s burden in mitigation is not met by financial decisions made in self-interest while \ntwo court judgments and other delinquent debts go unpaid. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant asks that her security clearance not be jeopardized by financial decisions \nmade for a coffee shop and tea room business that was negatively impacted by factors \noutside of her control. She knowingly accepted the risk that her and her spouse\u2019s business \nwould not be profitable. That being said, the salient concern in the security-clearance \ncontext is whether Applicant acted reasonably and exercised sound judgment in fulfilling \nfinancial obligations that she knowingly took on. After carefully considering and weighing \nthe financial considerations security concerns, I find that Applicant has not demonstrated \nthat she can be counted on to timely rectify her financial delinquencies. She has prioritized \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \npaying off financial obligations that were not delinquent while ignoring more than $80,000 \nin delinquent balances in the hope that they will someday no longer adversely affect her \ncredit. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). Based on the \nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. 95 \u2013 97) In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions to the original SOR and to \nSOR 1.w, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old and works for a defense contractor in a position that \nrequires he be eligible for access to classified information. His current employment began \nin July 2022, but his previous employer, for whom he still works in a similar position on a \npart-time basis, sponsored his March 2020 security clearance application. Applicant \nserved as an active duty and reserve member of the U.S. Navy between 2004 and 2007. \nHe first received a security clearance in 2004. After earning bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s \ndegrees in 2014 and 2015, respectively, he began studying for a doctoral degree in 2016, \nbut completed only one semester. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 54, 79) \nApplicant was married from February 2005 until December 2020, when he and his \nex-wife finalized a divorce. They separated in 2016. Applicant has a son, age 15, and a \ndaughter, age 18, with his ex-wife. He has full custody of his son. When they separated, \nApplicant and his ex-wife agreed that Applicant would provide between $600 and $1,000 \neach month to support his daughter. After their daughter turned 18 in December 2021, \nhis child support obligation ended. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 57, 77 \u2013 79) \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he had \nexperienced \u201cfinancial hardships\u201d after separating from his ex-wife in 2016. He also listed \na credit counseling resource with whom he was working to resolve his debts. He did not \nlist any of the debts in his e-QIP; however, credit reports obtained by government \ninvestigators shortly after he submitted his e-QIP reflect the debts alleged in SOR 1.a \u2013 \n1.v. Additionally, Applicant discussed those debts during a personal subject interview \n(PSI) on April 16, 2020. (GX 1 \u2013 5; GX 7) \nThe debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.h, and 1.j \u2013 1.m are for student loans that \nbecame delinquent in April 2017. They total $153,943, or about 85 percent of the total \ndebt alleged in the SOR. Applicant obtained the loans between 2010 and 2016 to pay \ntuition for his undergraduate and graduate studies. They were in forbearance when he \nmatriculated for his doctoral studies; however, those studies only lasted one semester in \n2016. Applicant dis-enrolled because he and his ex-wife had separated and he decided \ncould not continue his studies while meeting his obligations as a single father and still \nwork enough hours to pay child support. After he stopped going to school, his loans were \nno longer eligible for forbearance. After a subsequent grace period, his student loans \ncame due; however, he could not afford to pay them. (Answer; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 50 \u2013 51, \n79) \nIn June 2020, Applicant applied for relief from his student loans through the Public \nService Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

Information about PSLF found on the USDE \nwebpage (https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service), \nand on Applicant\u2019s application, lists the qualification requirements regarding, in relevant \npart, type of employment, type of loan, and history of payment. Applicant did not present \ninformation that shows he meets any of those qualifications. Even though his employer \ncontracts with the federal government, it is a for-profit company, a category specifically \nexcluded from PSLF. Additionally, Applicant did not show that he has made 120 qualifying \npayments on his loans. As to the type of loan eligible for PSLF, it appears Applicant\u2019s \nloans are included in that program. (AX P; Tr. 40 \u2013 41, 48 \u2013 49, 56) \nOn April 28, 2021, Applicant began a student loan rehabilitation program \nrepayment plan. Under that plan, he consolidated all of his delinquent student loans into \none monthly payment. He was required to pay $5.00 each month for at least nine months. \nIf he did so, his loans no longer would be delinquent and would start making higher, \nincome-based payments. Applicant made two or three payments, then stopped because \nof government-directed suspension of payments during the COVID-19 epidemic. His \nloans were then sold to another servicing corporation and he was advised to consolidate \nhis loans before he could resume his rehabilitation program or embark any other \nrepayment plan. On August 2, 2022, 16 days before his hearing, Applicant resubmitted \nhis PSLF application and a request to consolidate his loans. A credit report dated August \n10, 2022, lists his student loans as deferred until November 2022, at which time he \nestimates his monthly payments will be about $700. Based on all of the foregoing, I find \nthat Applicant\u2019s student loans are not currently delinquent. However, he is not eligible for \nPSLF and, after his current deferral ends, he will have to begin repaying all of the student \nloans alleged in the SOR. (Answer; GX 3 \u2013 5; GX 7; AX C; Tr. 51 \u2013 57) \nIn June 2019, Applicant enlisted the services of a financial counseling firm to \nresolve debts that remained from his marriage. He averred that the financial counselor \nwith whom he worked used improper methods to make it seem as if those debts he felt \nwere his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility had been resolved and his credit rating restored. He \nexplained that she froze his credit and claimed to have corresponded with his creditors. \nBecause he thought the financial counseling firm had resolved his financial problems, he \ntook no further action, even after his PSI in April 2020. After he received the SOR, he \ncontacted another financial counseling firm who guided him through the process of \ncorresponding directly with his creditors to negotiate settlement of his debts. He testified \nthat he sent letters to his creditors, but that he has not followed through on any other \nactions recommended by the second financial counseling firm.

As to his ability to start paying his student loans when his deferral \nends, he stated he would be able to because he no longer has to pay child support for his \nolder child.

(Tr. 57, 68 \u2013 76) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the SOR allegations \nthat Applicant accrued significant past-due or delinquent debt, the single largest of which \nconstituted about 94 percent of the debt at issue and was still outstanding as of the \nhearing. This information reasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances \nthat is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, \nmultiple, and in many instances, unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) only partially applies. To his credit, Applicant sought assistance in 2019, \neven though the person he retained possibly was perpetrating a fraud. As a result, he \nthought his financial problems had been meaningfully addressed and he took no further \naction until after he received the SOR. When he learned his debts were still delinquent, \nhe retained another credit assistance resource; however, he did not present any \ninformation that reflects a debt resolution plan, and he admitted that he did not follow up \non that firm\u2019s recommendations. \nAside from the tax lien at SOR 1.v, which was resolved well before the SOR, AG \n\u00b6 20(d) also does not apply. As to his student loans, Applicant relies on his application for \nrelief through the PSLF program. However, he did not establish that he might qualify. He \nalso started a student loan rehabilitation program, but only after receiving the SOR. He \nmade only three $5 payments under that program. As to his other debts, he argues that \nhe did not act sooner to start resolving his debts because he thought his first financial \ncounselor had resolved everything. To overcome that setback, he retained another credit \ncounselor, but he did not follow through on an identifiable plan to negotiate with creditors \nand resolve his debts. In short, despite being aware of having delinquent debts as far \nback as his April 2020 PSI, Applicant did not take any identifiable action to resolve his \ndebts until after he received the SOR. In some cases, he did not act until just before his \nhearing. In the case of his student loans, which comprise most of the debt at issue, he \ndid not establish that he would be able to pay them after deferral. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because he did not support his claims that many of the \ndebts at issue here are his ex-wife\u2019s responsibility. To the contrary, all of the debts at \nissue here are individual accounts according to his credit reports. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply because the only information Applicant provided about \nhis federal and state income taxes between 2018 and 2021 showed that he requested \nfiling extensions in 2018 and 2021. Those extensions have since expired, and Applicant \nhas not filed his past-due returns or arranged with state and federal tax authorities to bring \ncurrent his filing status. \nAs to AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant claims his financial problems are rooted in \ncircumstances beyond his control; namely, the end of his marriage in the 2015 \u2013 2016 \ntimeframe. Such an event falls squarely within the meaning of uncontrollable \ncircumstances; however, to receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), it also was incumbent upon \nApplicant to show that he acted responsibly in the face of those circumstances.

Combined with a lack of information about his current finances that would \ngenerate confidence in his financial judgment, all of the foregoing sustains the doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s judgment regarding his finances that have been raised by the record \nevidence as a whole. On balance, available information is not sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by the Government under this guideline. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and the adverse impact his \ndivorce likely had on his personal finances. However, it fell to Applicant to establish that \nhe acted responsibly in the wake of uncontrolled circumstances and that his financial \nproblems will not recur. The record evidence as a whole does not show that he met his \nburden of persuasion. Available information does not resolve the doubts raised by \nApplicant\u2019s financial history. Because protection of the national interest is the principal \nfocus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against the \nindividual\u2019s request for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1u: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

He graduated from \nhigh school in 2003, received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007, and completed a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2009.

While in that position, he applied for and was \ngranted eligibility for a public trust position in March 2010. After holding the public trust \nposition, he illegally used marijuana at least four times between June 2012 and August \n2013. He stated that he smoked marijuana while visiting a long-time friend in another \nstate. \nDuring a May 13, 2015 interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nquestioned about his illegal use of marijuana. He indicated he was associating less with \nhis marijuana-using friend because he had a girlfriend. He told the investigator that he \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future. (FORM, Item 3) following the background \ninvestigation, Applicant was granted eligibility for a secret clearance in August 2015. \nApplicant worked for federal contractors as a senior program analyst between \nMarch 2015 and December 2019, and as a network data analyst between March 2020 \nand January 2021. He started working for his current employer in January 2021. He \nsubmitted his most recent SCA in August 2020. \nDuring a September 23, 2020 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \nstated that he used marijuana between June 2012 and December 2018.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence Memorandum\nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, made it clear that state laws do\nnot authorize citizens to violate federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act (21\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug.  \n \n \n \nChanges to state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, effective June 8 2017). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant \nin national security determinations. The adjudicative authority must determine if the use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, 50 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3343 (2008), specifically prohibits a federal agency from granting or renewing \na clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict, and under \nfederal law, use of marijuana remains unlawful. (See, SEAD 4, App. B) \nExecutive Order 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace (September 25,1985) \nmandates a drug-free workplace and drug-free federal workforce, and expressly states \nthat use of illegal drugs on or off duty by federal employees in positions with access to \nsensitive information may pose a serious risk to national security and is inconsistent \nwith the trust placed in such employees as servants of the public. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production \nand distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive \nposition are prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.  \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from about 2012 to 2013, after \nhe applied for and was granted eligibility for a position of trust in 2010. He used \nmarijuana with varying frequency, between 2015 and 2018, after he was granted access \nto classified information in 2015. He told a government investigator during a 2015 \ninterview, that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Thus, he acknowledged \nknowing that the use of marijuana was illegal under federal law, and that the \nGovernment has a policy against security clearance holders using illegal drugs. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record established the above disqualifying conditions. An evaluation of \napplicable mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant has a history of illegal marijuana possession and use between 2012 and \n2018. He illegally used marijuana between January 2012 and 2015, after he applied for \nand was granted a public trust position in 2010. He applied for a secret clearance in \n2015. During a subsequent interview, he stated his intent not to use marijuana again in \nthe future, and he was granted a secret clearance in 2015. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant used marijuana again between 2015 and 2018, while \npossessing a secret clearance.

His possession and use of marijuana after stating his intent in 2015 not to use \nmarijuana again, and while holding a secret clearance, cast doubts on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and his ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. His suitability to hold a clearance is questionable, \nespecially because his substance misuse occurred while holding a position of trust and \nwhile possessing a clearance. \nApplicant claimed he has not used marijuana since 2018, and promised not to \nuse marijuana in the future. However, considering his past criminal behavior and his \nempty promises to stop his marijuana use, the passage of time so far is insufficient to \nestablish that his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. He was aware of the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s policy against illegal drug use, and the adverse security consequences \nfor such use. Nevertheless, he was unwilling to stop using marijuana. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been working \nfor federal contractors since 2010. He was granted eligibility for a position of trust in \n2010, and for a secret clearance in 2015. He illegally used marijuana between 2012 and \n2018. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with federal rules \nand regulations continue to raise serious questions about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Considering the \nrecord as a whole, the passage of time since his most recent marijuana use so far is \ninsufficient to establish that his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant has formally \neschewed any future illegal drug abuse. (AppX B.)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant smoked, cultivated and sold marijuana over a two and a half year \nperiod while holding a security clearance. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nAlthough Applicant signed an April 2021, sworn statement of intent as to future \ndrug involvement (AppX K), his involvement, while holding a security clearance, is too \nrecent to mitigate the Government\u2019s concerns. Drug involvement and substance misuse \nis found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well respected in the \nworkplace. (TR at page 13 line 17 to page 23 line 3, and AppXs D, I and Q.) Overall, \nhowever, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and \nsubstance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant responded in a November 15, 2021 Answer to the SOR, \nand requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record \nwithout a hearing. \nOn December 7, 2021, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on December 9, 2021, and received by him on December 14, 2021. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted his Response to the FORM within the time provided, offered \nno objection to the FORM, and included additional material in extenuation and mitigation. \nDepartment Counsel offered no objection to the Response, which I marked as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A. On March 8, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me. I received the case file on March 14, 2022. Items 1 through 6 \nand AE A are admitted into evidence. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR \u00b6 1.a and \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b, with explanations. His admissions and \nexplanations are incorporated into these findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. He earned a high school diploma in May 1992. He is \nmarried, for the second time. He has two adult children who were born in 1992 and 1999, \nseveral years before his first marriage. He has never served in the military or been \nemployed by the government of the United States. He said that the DoD granted him \nsome level of local clearance, which was required for him to work as a bus driver under \nan Army support services contract, from August to September 2019. This clearance was \nrevoked when he was fired for failing a breath alcohol test. He is seeking national security \neligibility in connection with his current employment at the same Army installation, by a \ndifferent defense contractor, as a Fuel Ammunition Specialist. (Item 2; Item 3.) \nApplicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Liquor (DUI) on October \n3, 2001, according to a state criminal history report (Item 5.) The local municipal court \nprosecutor declined to prosecute the case, and it was dismissed (nolle pros.) on \nNovember 19, 2001. Since submitting his November 13, 2019 Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing, Applicant has denied having ever been arrested for DUI. In \nhis Answer he said he does not recall this incident. No evidence regarding his blood \nalcohol content (BAC) after this arrest appears in the FORM. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 5.) \nApplicant began working as a refueler at a U.S. Army airfield in September 2015. \nThis was his first employment by a DoD support-services contractor. He was fired from \nthat job for two reasons related to an aviation fuel spill that he caused. On January 24, \n2019, his employment was \u201cterminated effective immediately due to [his] refusal to take \na drug test after [his] accident on January 22, 2019.\u201d On January 31, 2019, after \ncompleting its investigation of the incident, the company also \u201cterminated [his \nemployment] effective immediately due to negligence and violation of safety protocol and \nprocedure before, during, and after a major fuel spill involving a fuel truck and helicopter.\u201d \nApplicant claimed that his employer had no training program and that he was not properly \ntrained to handle emergency shutdown procedures. He also claimed that the company \ndid not relieve him of duty to go take a drug test, but instead told him to clean up the fuel \nspill and then resume work, after which he went home. He said that after resting for at \nleast ten hours at home, he went to a clinic and \u201cfollowed up with the required drug testing, \nwhich [he] passed.\u201d He offered no corroboration for these explanations, which are \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincongruous with the quoted language of the formal letters of termination issued by his \nemployer two and nine days later. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3; Item 6.) \nA different support services contractor at the same Army installation hired \nApplicant in August 2019 to work as a bus driver. On the morning of September 3, 2019, \nhe was scheduled to drive a bus full of flight school students to a location that is not \nidentified in the FORM. Before the bus departed, another company employee notified the \nproject manager that Applicant smelled of alcohol and he was sent to a medical clinic for \na breath alcohol test. At 12:44 that afternoon his blood alcohol content (BAC) tested at \n.079; followed by a reading of .073 on the confirmation test administered 16 minutes later. \nThe project manager fired Applicant in a letter dated the same day for this direct violation \nof the company\u2019s safety and security policies. Applicant admitted these facts, and \nexplained that he was not aware he smelled of alcohol when he reported to work after \nstaying up late and drinking at home the night before. He said that he does not remember \nhow much or what he was drinking. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3; Item 4; AE A.) \nApplicant said that he is not dependent on alcohol anymore and it no longer \ncontrols his life, although he attended no treatment program and continues to drink. He \nsaid that his awareness of his past mistakes has made him a better man, husband, and \nemployee. He claimed, without providing further detail, that he voluntarily attended some \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) support sessions during 2019. He submitted letters signed \nby two coworkers who had known him for five months, in which they describe his \ndedication, professionalism, integrity, excellent performance, and skills working with \nothers. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since \nhe elected to have his case decided without a hearing. (Item 3; AE A.) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nAppellant was arrested for DUI in October 2001. He was substantially intoxicated \nwhen he reported to work at an Army installation after a long night of drinking in early \nSeptember 2019. He was assigned to drive a busload of flight school students that \nmorning. If a coworker had not promptly reported his inebriation to their project manager, \nhis actions would have severely jeopardized the welfare and safety of those flight \nstudents. He continues to consume alcohol. These facts raise significant security \nconcerns under the disqualifying conditions cited above. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could provide mitigation of the security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     (2)\n \n \n \n     (3)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was fired from his former employment with a DoD contractor less than \nthree years ago for being intoxicated when he reported to his job that involved driving \nbusloads of military personnel. He held that job for less than a month. He was previously \narrested for DUI in 2001, so this incident was not unique and evinces a long term issue. \nApplicant neither participated in nor completed any alcohol treatment program, although \nhe claimed in 2019 to have voluntarily attended several AA meetings. He said that he is \nnot dependent on alcohol anymore and it no longer controls his life, although he continues \nto drink and failed to demonstrate a pattern of responsible consumption. Accordingly, he \nfailed to establish mitigation under any of the foregoing mitigating conditions. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of:   \n any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant was fired from his first job working for an Army support-services \ncontractor in January 2019 for negligence and violation of safety protocol and procedure \nbefore, during, and after a major fuel spill involving a fuel truck and helicopter; and for his \nrefusal to take a required drug test after the incident. He started his second employment \nwith a defense contractor in August 2019, but was fired on September 2, 2019, when he \nreported to work while intoxicated. He provided no evidence of substance abuse \ntreatment or other corroboration for his claim to have gotten his alcohol dependence \nunder control. This evidence establishes substantial security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(d). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 includes two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that would support mitigation under either of \nthe foregoing mitigating conditions, for the same reasons discussed above under \nGuideline G. He was fired by two DoD support-service contractors from jobs as a refueler \nand a bus driver within an eight-month period in 2019 for serious negligence, violation of \nsafety procedures, refusing a required post-incident drug test, and reporting to work while \nincapacitated due to intoxication. He failed to show that such personal conduct is unlikely \nto recur. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person \nwho is accountable for his choices and actions. His irresponsible conduct led to a major \naviation fuel spill, and nearly jeopardized the health and safety of a busload of Army flight \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nschool students.

He has never been married and has no children. (Transcript \n(Tr.) at 30-34; GE 1, 2, 19) \nApplicant has a significant history of criminal offenses, including several alcohol-\nrelated offenses. In about January 2008, he was charged with driving with a suspended \ndriver\u2019s license after being pulled over for speeding. His driver\u2019s license was suspended \nbecause he had let his insurance coverage lapse. In about August 2008, he failed to \nappear for his court date for driving on a suspended license and was charged with \nfailure to appear. In September 2009, he pleaded guilty to driving on a suspended \nlicense, speeding, and failure to appear and was placed on probation before judgment \n(PBJ). He completed about three to six months of probation successfully and paid his \nrequired fines and court fees. (Tr. at 34-36, Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, \n19) \nApplicant was arrested in December 2009 in State A and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI), after driving home from a bar despite knowing he was \nintoxicated. He had a .13 blood alcohol content (BAC) at the time of his arrest. He spent \nthe night in jail. As it was Applicant\u2019s first DUI, these charges against him were dropped. \n(Tr. at 36-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 19) \nAbout two months later, in February 2010, Applicant was arrested in State A and \ncharged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). He had been drinking at a bar and decided \nto drive home despite knowing that he was intoxicated. He had a .19 BAC at the time of \nhis arrest. He spent one or two nights in jail. In October 2010, he pleaded guilty and was \nsentenced to 60 days in jail, all suspended.

As a result of his\nFebruary 2010 DWI, Applicant\u2019s accession to the Navy was declined.1  (Tr. 31, 59; GE 2, \n3, 19)  \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended license. His \nlicense had been administratively suspended as a result of his February 2010 DWI \ncharge. He pleaded guilty and received PBJ as a result of this charge. (Tr. at 41-43; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5, 6, 19) \nIn November 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and Failure to \nStop After Accident Involving Damage to Attended Vehicle/Property. Prior to his arrest, \nApplicant had been drinking alone at home for three to four hours and had consumed \nabout two bottles of wine. He decided to drive despite knowing he was impaired \nbecause he had to go to work. On his way to work, he collided with a pick-up truck, left \nthe scene of the accident, and drove the additional two to three miles to work at a \nrestaurant where he was employed as a bartender. While investigating the hit and run \ninvolving the aforementioned pick-up truck, the police determined that Applicant was \nresponsible and arrested him at work. Applicant had a .21 BAC when he was arrested. \nHe pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to 365 days in jail with all but 45 \ndays suspended, probation for three years, and two months of alcohol classes. He \nclaimed that he completed all the requirements of his sentence. In his January 2018 \nsubject interview (SI), he did not tell his investigator about the hit and run aspect of his \narrest. He only discussed a version of events involving the DWI that did not include \ncolliding with another vehicle. (Tr. at 43-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 7, 8, \n19, 20) \nApplicant attended court-ordered alcohol classes from February 2013 until April \n2013. Prior to attending these court-ordered classes, he voluntarily began attending \nsome Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. He attended AA meetings from January \n2013 until about July 2013. He completed a couple of the AA steps but did not have a \nsponsor. (Tr. 57-58; GE 19) \nIn late June 2017, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with intoxicated \nendangerment. Applicant was walking back to the location where he was staying after \ndrinking at a bar for seven or eight hours. A bouncer at the bar where Applicant had \nbeen drinking alerted the police that Applicant had too much to drink, so police began \nfollowing him. Applicant tried to steal a bike that was locked to a bench and pushed it \nover when he realized he could not take it. Police lost him for a couple of minutes, but \nthen relocated him when they saw him vomiting in a bush. When he noticed police were \nfollowing him, Applicant ran to evade them, but they apprehended him. Applicant spent \nthe night in jail. Applicant pleaded guilty to intoxicated endangerment in August 2017. \n(Tr. 49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 9, 19, 21) \n1 Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s issues with joining the Navy, \ncannot be used for disqualification purposes.

In January \n2018, he pleaded guilty to this charge and prepaid a fine. The vehicle that he was \ndriving was totaled as a result of this accident. (Tr. 49-50, 52; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 10) \nIn March 2018, Applicant was charged with Driver Using Hands to Use Hand-\nHeld Telephone while Motor Vehicle was in Motion. This charge resulted from his \ninvolvement in an accident because he was looking at his mobile phone and rear-ended \nanother vehicle. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine. (Tr. 49-52; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 11) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was cited for speeding when he was caught traveling \n64 mph in a 55 mph zone. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine. (Tr. 52-53; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 12) \nSometime in 2021, Applicant was cited for speeding after a speed camera caught \nhim exceeding the speed limit. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine online. (Tr. 53-54) \nApplicant admitted that his drinking has caused problems with his family, his \nfinances, and his health. Applicant has a paternal history of kidney disease. Beginning \nwhen he was about 25 years old in 2012, Applicant showed symptoms of chronic kidney \ndisease. As early as January 2018, he recognized that his alcohol consumption had \nexacerbated his kidney disease. However, he continued to consume alcohol to excess, \nacknowledging that, at that time, he was consuming four to five drinks once or twice per \nmonth and drinking to the point of intoxication about once every two months. (Tr. 29, 55-\n56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C)  \nAs a result of a referral by the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication \nFacility (DOD CAF), in February 2021, with a follow-up in June 2021, Applicant \nunderwent a psychological evaluation by a licensed clinical psychologist (Psychologist). \nThe Psychologist was contracted by the DOD CAF. In order to make her psychological \nevaluation, the Psychologist reviewed background information submitted by the DOD \nCAF, the results of a clinical interview, testing observations, and the results of the \nPersonality Assessment Inventory. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3) \nBased upon these measuring tools, the Psychologist diagnosed Applicant with \nalcohol use disorder (moderate-severe). She found the risk of future alcohol-related \nincidents to be moderate with a guarded prognosis. She noted her concern that, despite \nall of the adverse effects alcohol has had on him, Applicant continued to consume it \nwithout undergoing any alcohol-related treatment. She also noted that, in about 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s doctor recommended that he abstain from alcohol entirely. (Tr. 59; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant claimed that, in the Fall of 2021, he turned over a new leaf and stopped \ndrinking. This decision was spurred partly by knowing that his kidneys were \u201cbasically all \nthe way gone,\u201d and a May 2021 medical emergency that put him in the hospital after \n\u201cthrowing up 10 pints of blood\u201d and nearly dying.

(Tr. 29, 55-56; GE 2, 3, 19; AE B, C) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 32 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n23,400. Many of these delinquent debts are medical debts resulting from Applicant\u2019s \naforementioned chronic kidney issues. However, Applicant also has other debts, such \nas a delinquent credit-card debt, a delinquent debt to State A, a delinquent student-loan \ndebt, and a delinquent telecommunications debt. Applicant attributed his financial issues \nto his youth, his disorganization, and a lack of income. He also attributed them to his \npast and ongoing health conditions. He has been covered by health insurance through \nhis employer as of March 2018 at the latest. (TR. 63-83, 110-121; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 13-19; AE A-D) \nThe $1,916 judgment entered in 2011 alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.a has not been \nresolved. Applicant claimed that he has paid this debt through garnishments, however, \nhe did not provide any documentation establishing it was paid. He testified that he may \nhave had documentation showing the debt was paid at one time, but he no longer does. \n(Tr. 63-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 13) \nThe $848 medical judgment entered in 2013 alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.b has not been \nresolved.

However, he did not provide any \ndocumentation establishing that it was paid. (Tr. 65-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 14, 19) \nThe $2,461 judgment entered in 2017 in favor of State A alleged in \u00b6 4.c has not \nbeen resolved.

(Tr. 70-71; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 15) \nThe $119 telecommunications debt alleged in \u00b6 4.i has not been resolved. \nApplicant testified that he paid this debt sometime in 2019 but did not provide any \ndocumentation establishing it was paid. The debt appears on Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit \nreport but not on his 2021 credit report.

(Tr. \n76-83; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A, B) \nApplicant and his mother also testified that they believe that most of the medical \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6 4 have been paid. Applicant claimed that he could not match up \nhis payment receipts with the debts listed in the SOR because creditors combined the \ndebts into one statement. He was unable to identify which documents he provided \ncorroborated the payments he alleged he made on the remaining SOR debts. Many of \nApplicant\u2019s documents relate to medical services that were provided to him in March \n2021 and later.

Applicant largely began his efforts to pay these medical debts at the \nbeginning of 2022. Most of the funds that he used to pay these debts were gifts from \nfriends and family, often raised through his mother\u2019s fundraising efforts in February and \nMarch 2022. As Applicant did not provide documentation corroborating his alleged \npayments, the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.f, 4.g, 4.j through 4.aa and 4.cc through 4.gg are \nunresolved. (Tr. 76-83,108-121; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 17-19; AE A-D) \nApplicant testified that, at some time between 2005 and 2008, his aunt gave her \npermission to add her name to his loan application from Bank A for a student loan. He \ntestified that his aunt told him she would be responsible for paying back this debt. He \napplied for this loan in his name and added his aunt as a co-signor. The debt became \ndelinquent by 2017 and Bank A filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his aunt to recover \nthe balance. Applicant\u2019s aunt hired an attorney and defended herself against Bank A\u2019s \nlawsuit, claiming that Applicant had forged her signature to the loan application without \nher permission. Bank A dismissed Applicant\u2019s aunt from the lawsuit with prejudice, but \nobtained a judgment against Applicant as described in SOR \u00b6 4.d. (Tr. 70-76, 99-100; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 15, 17, 22, 23) \nApplicant claimed that his aunt changed her mind about their agreement with \nrespect to this loan years after he applied for it because she needed money.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI or DWI in 2009, 2010, and 2012. The 2012 DWI \ninvolved Applicant being arrested at work while he was intoxicated.

A clinical psychologist diagnosed him with alcohol \nuse disorder. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nAlcohol use has been causing Applicant legal and health problems for most of \nthe last 13 years. Sometime in 2019, his doctor told him to abstain from alcohol entirely. \nDespite this warning, he continued to consume alcohol. In February 2021, a \npsychologist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder (moderate-severe) and was \nconcerned that he was still consuming alcohol without treatment. He continued to \nconsume alcohol after this diagnosis. \nApplicant had a couple of medical emergencies in May and July 2021, yet he \ncontinued to consume alcohol until sometime later that Fall. He has never completed an \nalcohol treatment program and is not in one now. While I believe Applicant was sincere \nat his hearing about his commitment to abstain from alcohol, his decision to keep \ndrinking until relatively recently despite all the warning signs over the years leaves me \nwith doubts about his reliability and judgment. Moreover, while he testified that he has \nnot consumed alcohol since the Fall of 2021, when compared to his lengthy history with \nalcohol, I do not believe that he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nabstinence. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s \nthree \nalcohol-related \ndriving \noffenses \nand \nhis \nintoxicated \nendangerment charge were cross-alleged under criminal conduct. He has also been \ncharged with hit and run and driving on a suspended license. The above disqualifying \ncondition is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant had three DUIs, the last of which involved an accident. He had an \nalcohol-related criminal charge in 2017, and he has continued to violate traffic laws as \nevidenced by his 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021 moving violations. For these reasons and \nthe ongoing concerns I have related to Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption, I do not believe \nthere has been sufficient evidence of rehabilitation or that the criminal behavior is \nunlikely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that includes medical debt, \ncredit-card debt, student-loan debt, and debt to State A. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide \nevidence in mitigation. \nThe evidence is insufficient to raise AG \u00b6 19(d). Applicant credibly testified that \nhis aunt had given him her express permission to sign her name as a co-signor for his \nstudent loans while he was in school, including the loan listed in \u00b6 4.d. I believe that he \nwas sincere in his belief that he had her consent to include her name on the loan \ndocuments. Applicant further testified that his aunt later changed her mind when she \nneeded money. I note that she first made her unwillingness to be a co-signor on this \nloan clear when the creditor filed a lawsuit some ten years after the loan was obtained. \nApplicant\u2019s aunt may have only learned about her responsibility for the loan in \n2017 when Bank A filed a lawsuit against her, but there is no evidence of this possibility. \nThese factors undermine the veracity of her claim of Applicant\u2019s forgery. As Applicant\u2019s \naunt passed away in 2018, I was unable to observe her testimony in order to gauge her \ncredibility. Given these considerations, I find that Applicant reasonably believed that he \nhad his aunt\u2019s consent and therefore did not engage in deceptive or illegal financial \npractices. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his youth and disorganization. \nThese causes were not beyond his control. He also attributed his financial problems to \nhis chronic health conditions. This cause was beyond his control. \nThere is documentary corroboration that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.e, 4.h, \nand 4.p have been paid. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.e, 4.h, and 4.p are concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution \nof the remaining SOR debts. Applicant stated that he intends to pay the remaining SOR \ndebts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Applicant could not identify any documents he \nsubmitted that showed a favorable resolution of the remaining SOR debts. After careful \nscrutiny of his documents, I could find no such evidence, either. It is reasonable to \nexpect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). \nTo the extent that Applicant has made a favorable resolution of any of the \nremaining SOR debts, he did so beginning in 2022. The first amendment to the SOR, \nwhich listed his debts as a security concern, was issued in November 2021. An \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. ISCR \nCase No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nIn February 2021, Applicant engaged the services of a financial advisor. \nHowever, as evidenced by the lack of favorable resolution of many of the SOR debts, \nthere is insufficient indication that his financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. \nOverall, I am unable to find that the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control, that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances, or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his SOR debts. His financial \nissues are ongoing and continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. The financial considerations security concern is not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAs evidenced by his issues with alcohol, his numerous arrests and citations, and \nhis financial delinquencies, Applicant has a lengthy history of failing to abide by rules \nand regulations. These problems also show Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment. AG \u00b6 \n16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and financial \nconsiderations guidelines. Likewise, AG \u00b6 16(d) is not perfectly applicable because \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is covered under the aforementioned guidelines. \nHowever, the \ngeneral concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(c), and 16(d) are established. \nFor the reasons I indicated in my analysis of the financial considerations \nguideline, Applicant\u2019s conduct in signing his aunt\u2019s name to his loan application does not \nestablish a security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 or 16. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant has committed himself to abstaining from alcohol and has done so for \nabout six months. Hopefully, his drinking and his illegal drinking activities are a thing of \nthe past. His intention to remain sober is a positive step. As evidenced by his recent \npayments on some of his medical debt, he has made tentative positive strides there, as \nwell. However, his conduct that has been alleged under Guideline E, such as drinking \nand driving, does not qualify as \u201cminor.\u201d Only about a year has passed since his last \nspeeding ticket and he has established a pattern of getting a moving violation at least \nonce per year. As I discussed in my analysis of the other applicable guidelines, given \nthe relatively short period of time that has elapsed since Applicant \u201cturned over a new \nleaf,\u201d I have lingering doubts that his frequently repeated unreliable or inappropriate \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 17(d) partially, but does \nnot fully apply. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G, J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, financial considerations and \npersonal conduct security concerns. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n                         \n \n \n                                   \n \n \n                      \n \n \n                       \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n                            \n \n \n                                  \n \n \n                              \n \n \n                                   \n \n \n                          \n \n \n                        \n \n \n                               \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.d:     \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.e:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.f-4.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.h:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.i-4.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.p: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.q-4.aa: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.cc-4.gg  \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.hh:     \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

In August 2010, as a first year college student, at the \nage of 21, Applicant lived in student housing, and was employed as a student housing \nadvisor. Applicant knew that the University was a dry campus and alcohol was not \npermitted on campus. Despite this, Applicant purchased alcohol and brought it on \ncampus. Applicant testified that because he had noticed his Senior Housing Advisor, \nwho manages all of the apartments in the building, bring alcoholic beverages onto the \ncampus, he felt that he should also be able to do so. Applicant states that he was \nmerely following his leadership. \n(Tr. p. 18.) A housing check was performed on \nApplicant\u2019s room, the alcohol was discovered, and he was terminated from the job. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn October 2011, Applicant was employed at a clothing store. Applicant was \nassisting a female customer with items for her brother. He spent several hours helping \nthem find suitable items to purchase and they spent several hundred dollars.  At the end \nof the sale, Applicant asked the woman for her phone number. Applicant stated that \nshe gave him her number and did not appear to be offended. On Applicant\u2019s next day \nat work, Applicant was notified by his manager that the customer had made a complaint \nand felt uncomfortable about providing her telephone number to Applicant. Applicant \nwas told by his manager that he was going to be written up as a result of the complaint. \nIn lieu of termination, Applicant decided to leave the company because he thought he \nwas wrongfully disciplined. (Tr. p. 26 and Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn April 2015, while working for employer A, Applicant received his first written \nwarning for making an inappropriate sexual comment to a female employee at work. \nOn this occasion, Applicant states that he was talking with several employees when he \nmade a joke about a female employee who was eating a popsicle, and referenced her \nperforming oral sex on her boyfriend. (Tr. p. 29.)   \nIn June 2016, while still working for employer A, Applicant received his second \nwritten warning, this time for being in personal space and inappropriate touching, when \nhe adjusted the bra strap that was showing on a female colleague.

He \nthought that her top was inappropriate and too revealing. As a friend to her, he lifted \nher bra strap up on her shoulder, and told her that he just wanted to make sure that she \nwas okay. He said, she thanked him. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3.) Applicant \nbelieves his intentions were pure and right. He believes that since then, he has learned \nto be more professional. \nIn January 2017, Applicant was terminated from his employment with employer A \nfor inappropriate comments. \nOn this occasion, Applicant was overheard on the \ntelephone with a contractor. \nAfter giving him instructions on how to download a \ncompany application on the computer, the contractor stated that he was not good with \ntechnology, but that his wife was good with that. \nApplicant testified that he \ncongratulated the contractor on the fact that his wife was the one that handled the \ntechnology, while he did the hard work. Applicant stated, \u201cGod gave us women to do \nthe tech stuff. You do the hard work.\u201d (Tr. p. 34.) Applicant\u2019s conversation was heard \nby a coworker and believed it to be sexist and anti-feminist. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn June 2019, Applicant received a written warning from his employer for \ninappropriate conduct directed toward a female co-worker. Applicant went behind the \nfemale co-worker and hugged her from behind. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t hug me from behind \nbecause you\u2019re hugging my fat rolls.\u201d Applicant then stated, \u201cOkay, instead of touching \nyour fat rolls, I\u2019m going to touch your chest.\u201d (Tr. pp. 38-39.) Applicant testified that, \nafter the fact, he knew it was wrong, and that he had made a bad mistake again. (Tr. p. \n40 and Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn September 2019, Applicant was terminated from his employment for falsifying \nhis time card. Applicant explained that there was a security post that he was supposed \nto cover and he forgot to do it. When he realized that he forgot to cover it, he falsified \nthe time sheet to indicate that he had covered it.  When he was asked if he covered the \npost, he stated that he had. \nUltimately, when it was all sorted out, Applicant \nacknowledged that he had lied, and that he had falsified the time sheet. \nIn January 2020, Applicant began working for his current employer. In March \n2021, he received a written warning for being out of uniform. Applicant explained that \nthe company policy requires him to wear his uniform, and he is allowed to wear a white \nundershirt. \nHe is not allowed to wear long sleeves. \nIt was a cold morning, and \nApplicant\u2019s jacket was not providing enough warmth. Applicant put on a long sleeve \nwhite thermal underneath his uniform with his body armor and his jacket. Applicant took \nhis jacket off, and the client saw it. The client called his boss and reported that the \nApplicant was out of uniform.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several in several adjudication issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole, supports a, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of \n(1) Untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nSince 2010, Applicant has exhibited a pattern and practice of questionable \ndecision making and inappropriate conduct in the work environment. As a result, he \nhas received a number of written warnings from his employers, and has been \nterminated from at least three jobs. Terminations of this sort are highly unusual and \nonly justified if the misconduct is serious and egregious. For eleven years, from 2010 to \n2021, Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects various episodes of serious immaturity and a lack of \ncommon sense. \nIn totality, these episodes show a pattern of poor judgment, \ninappropriate behavior, a lack of candor, and dishonesty, that is unacceptable in a work \nenvironment. Even now, Applicant has not taken full responsibility for his misconduct \nand in most cases still does not seem to fully understand what was wrong with his \nbehavior. To be eligible for access to classified information one\u2019s overall character and \nconduct must consistently show pristine honesty, integrity, good judgment and reliability. \nApplicant\u2019s serious blemish on his employment record raises serious questions about \nhis judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Under the particular circumstances of this \ncase, Applicant is not found to be sufficiently trustworthy to access classified \ninformation. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly, Guideline E \nis found against the Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s long history of inappropriate \nconduct is unacceptable in a work environment. He is currently participating in group \ntherapy to help him with his thought processes and how to properly interact with others \nin a professional environment. He is commended for this, and encouraged to continue \nhis training in this area. \nAt this time, Applicant has not demonstrated that he can be trusted with the \nnational secrets. This is not an individual with whom the Government can be confident \nto know that he will always follow rules and regulations, and do the right thing, even \nwhen no one is looking. He is not qualified for access to classified information, nor is it \nclear that the information will be properly protected. \nApplicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of June 18, 2021, Applicant owed eight debts totaling $49,484 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.e-1.f, and 1.h-1.k); three charged-off debts totaling $41,283 (SOR \u00b6 1.c-1.d and 1.g); and a $535 judgment debt from 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and 1.k, and indicated that he was working on repayment terms for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f; that he has taken action to pay off the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, but that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d has been written off. Applicant denied owing the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g, asserting that they were his spouse\u2019s debts; the student loan delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j, asserting that they had been paid in full; and the judgment debt, asserting that it was for a check forged by his spouse. I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant was legally responsible to repay the delinquencies admitted by him. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact. 2 Applicant is a 62-year-old program manager employed by a defense contractor most recently since July 1997. He previously worked for the company as an engineering assistant from September 1980 to February 1994. (GE 1.) Around July 1979, he was granted a secret-level security clearance for his matriculation at one of the United States military academies. He resigned his commission in October 1979 for medical reasons. ",

On September 27, 2021, the case was assigned to me to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on \nOctober 6, 2021. \nScheduling the hearing was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On February \n22, 2022, I informed Applicant that I was scheduling hearings via Microsoft Teams. After \nsome coordination with the parties, on April 8, 2022, I scheduled a video conference \nhearing to be held on May 6, 2022. On May 2, 2022, I granted Applicant a continuance to \nMay 17, 2022, to give him time to review the Government\u2019s potential exhibits, which he \nindicated he had not received in time for a May 6, 2022 hearing. \nAt the hearing convened on May 17, 2022, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-4 and \n6) and five Applicant exhibits (AE A-E) were admitted into the record. Applicant objected to \nproposed GE 5, a summary report of his personal subject interviews. The document was \nnot accepted into the record as it lacked the authentication required for admissibility under \nE3.1.20 of the Directive. Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) \nreceived by DOHA on May 26, 2022. \nI held the record open for one month after the hearing for additional documentation \nfrom Applicant. On June 16, 2022, Applicant submitted four documents, which were \nadmitted without objection as AE F through AE H.

When \nApplicant answered the SOR, he admitted the alleged debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f and 1.k, and \nindicated that he was working on repayment terms for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, \nand 1.f; that he has taken action to pay off the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, but that the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d has been written off. Applicant denied owing the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.g, asserting that they were his spouse\u2019s debts; the student loan delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h-1.j, asserting that they had been paid in full; and the judgment debt, asserting that it \nwas for a check forged by his spouse. \nI accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant was legally responsible to \nrepay the delinquencies admitted by him.

On her death, he served as the administrator for her trust (Tr. 53), \nwhich included the home that they had shared during their marriage. She owned the home \nfrom her previous marriage, and the deed to the property w\n as in her name only. (Tr. 61-\n62.) Three of her children from a previous marriage (including a son now deceased) \ncontested the estate. (Tr. 147-148.) The trust tied up Applicant\u2019s finances, as he continued \nto make the payments on two mortgages with initial balances of $85,000-$90,000 and \n$50,000-$55,000 on the property. He paid off the mortgages around mid-2018, and, \npursuant to a court order, sold the property in September 2018. The proceeds from the \nsale were held by the trust until his second wife\u2019s estate was settled in January 2022. (Tr. \n62-63.) In the end, Applicant and his second wife\u2019s children settled out of court. (Tr. 148.) \nApplicant incurred more than $43,000 in attorney\u2019s fees in the battle over the trust assets. \n(Tr. 34,146-147.) \nApplicant incurred substantial credit-card debt during his second marriage, in part to \npay medical co-payments for his then-wife\u2019s care. (Tr. 59-60.) He testified that most of her \nmedical debts were written off by her creditors on her death. (Tr. 59.) However, he also \ntestified that, in 2016, he paid off more than $90,000 in credit-card debt on four accounts \n(two accounts not alleged and the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f). His monthly payment \ntotaling $4,000 on those four accounts was unsustainable, so in July 2016, he re-\nmortgaged his home from his first marriage for $103,000 and used some of the funds to \npay off the four credit-card accounts. (GE 2; Tr. 57-60.) Additionally, in October 2016, he \nobtained a debt consolidation loan to pay off some credit-card debt. That loan became \ndelinquent in October 2018 and was charged off for $20,138 (not alleged). \nStill grieving the loss of his second wife and lonely, Applicant met his third wife in \nlate 2015 while out at a club. (Tr. 68, 87.) She was 29 years younger than him, had a \nyoung child (Tr. 69), and portrayed herself as loving with good ethics. (Tr. 30.)

(GE 1.) They \nlived apart throughout their marriage because she wanted to stay near her family, and it \nwas not a reasonable commute for him. (Tr. 70-71.) He thought that they would live \ntogether at some point, but it didn\u2019t happen. (Tr. 60.) Applicant paid for her living expenses, \ndaycare for her child, and gave her additional money when she asked for it. (Tr. 30-31, 69.) \nHe gave her about $2,200 a month starting in February 2016. (Tr. 70.) She held part-time \nemployment in daycare. (Tr. 72.) \nAround September 2016, Applicant\u2019s spouse began running up debt on his credit \ncards. (Tr. 74.) Initially, he saw no issues with her purchases, as they were for items he \nthought she needed, like a television. (Tr. 75.) She initially charged $200 to $300 a month \non his accounts, which did not seem excessive until it \u201csnowballed.\u201d (Tr. 72.) Eventually, \nunbeknownst to Applicant at the time (Tr. 77), she gained access to his credit cards by \ngoing through his wallet and writing down the account numbers. She purchased items over \nthe telephone using his credit and pawned some items for the money. She pawned her \nrings in late 2017 or early 2018. He argued with her over her misuse of his credit, but he \ndid not immediately close the accounts, as she would make \u201call kinds of threats\u201d that he \ncould no longer see her or she no longer wanted to be a couple. (Tr. 31-33, 73-75.) \nAdditionally, in late 2017, she took his ATM card without his knowledge and drained his \nbank account. He discovered it when he went to use the card. (Tr. 74.) Yet he continued to \nsupport her because he took his marriage vows seriously, and she would cry that she \nneeded help. (Tr. 75.) He took no action to freeze his credit because he did not know he \ncould do so. (Tr. 100.) \nIn August 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse was arrested for possession of heroin, \nconfirming Applicant\u2019s suspicions that she had a drug problem. (Tr. 68.) They shared a \nchecking account, and on her arrest, he immediately closed all his accounts so she could \nno longer have access. (Tr. 72.) He testified that he paid for four drug-rehabilitation \nprograms for her (Tr. 33, 76), spending \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d in increments of \u201c$700 here, \n$800 there.\u201d He purchased plane tickets and sent her money for bedding and clothes. (Tr. \n149.) During her fourth rehabilitation program, she purchased a car in early 2019 that was \neventually repossessed in September 2019. He asserts that she managed to obtain the \nloan in SOR \u00b6 1.b for the vehicle in his name without his knowledge. (Tr. 33, 37, 81.) He \nstopped providing financially for his spouse in March 2019. (Tr. 80, 151.) Applicant and his \nspouse tried to live together in March 2019, after she had been discharged from her \nrehabilitation program, but that lasted only one week as he discovered she was again using \ndrugs. (Tr. 82-83, 151.) By the time he and his wife separated in June 2019, Applicant was \nseriously in debt. (GEs 1-4.) He estimates that he provided his spouse a total of $150,000 \nto $200,000 between 2016 and early 2019. (Tr. 82.) He testified that \u201cit took [him] a long \ntime to wake up to the fact that [he was] dealing with a drug addict.\u201d (Tr. 141.) \nApplicant filed for divorce in May 2022. (AE C; Tr. 46, 149.) He paid a $1,000 \nretainer fee upfront. (Tr. 148.) He and his spouse entered into a prenuptial agreement in \n2016 when his annual salary was about $150,000. (Tr. 152.) Under that agreement, he \nwould have lost about $100,000, which was a percentage of his property holding from his \nfirst marriage, if he filed for divorce without cause, so he delayed filing for divorce until he \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDebt alleged in SOR \n \nDelinquency history \nPayment Status \n$186 \nmedical \ndebt \nin\ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n Medical debt first delinquent \nAug. 2018; $186 assigned \nfor collection Feb. 2019.

(AE I.) \nOn January 30, 2020, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to SF 86 inquiries into \ndelinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant reported that student loans he had taken \nout as a parent for his son\u2019s education became delinquent around June 2019 in the \namount of $15,000 and were placed for collection. He reported that the debt collector \nwould not agree to a three-year repayment plan and so began garnishing his pay at $720 \nevery two weeks since September 2019. He also listed two credit-card delinquencies of \napproximately $23,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $26,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a jewelry debt for $8,000 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); delinquent property taxes of $7,500 (not alleged, on his property from his first \nmarriage); two smaller retail charge debts of $2,600 and $700 (not alleged) that he paid off; \nand a car-loan delinquency of $26,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for a repossessed vehicle. He cited as \nthe reason for his financial issues that his \u201csoon to be ex-wife is a drug addict and stole \nmonies [from him] placing [him] in extreme financial duress.\u201d He indicated that those debts \nthat were not paid were on a list to be addressed once his divorce is finalized, and that he \nplanned to resolve the issues \u201cin an order that is reasonable.\u201d (GE 1.) \nThe delinquency and payment histories for the debts in the SOR, as reflected on \none or more of the credit reports in evidence from March 2020 (GE 4), March 2021 (GE 3), \nand April 2022 (GE 2), are reflected in the following table. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$23,051 charged-off account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nCredit-card account opened \nJan. 2004; $21,626 for \ncollection Sep. 2017; asserts \nthat debt was incurred by \nspouse after he paid off the \nbalance in 2016 (Tr. 103); \ncharged off for $23,051 Apr. \n2018; $15,581 past due as \nof Mar. 2021 on $21,626 \nbalance; \nwritten \noff \nby \ncreditor.

He \nasserts nonetheless that the garnishment of his wages was voluntary in that he \u201cchose not \nto fight it.\u201d The U.S. DoED wanted a lump-sum payment of the balances in full and would \nnot agree to accept installment payments, so he \u201caccepted\u201d the garnishment as it operated \nas an installment repayment plan in amount similar to what he planned to offer. (Tr. 134-\n135.) In November 2021, the U.S. DoED notified Applicant that he was owed a refund for \ninvoluntary payments received since collections actions temporarily ceased by operation of \nlaw on March 13, 2020, due to the pandemic. (AE F.) The letter did not specify the amount \nto be refunded. Applicant maintains that the document is proof that he has paid the \nParents Plus student loans. (AE I.)  \nIn June 2021, Applicant bought a used vehicle. He put down about $3,000 and \nobtained an automobile loan for $13,654 with a repayment term of $261 per month. (GE 2; \nTr. 37-38, 47, 93.) As of March 2022, he had made timely payments on the account to \nreduce the loan balance to $11,970. (GE 2.) Applicant testified that he is paid up on the \nloan through July 2022. (Tr. 38.) \nIn February 2022, Applicant received $108,000 in the settlement of his second wife\u2019s \nestate. (Tr. 42, 148.) He asserts that about $40,000 of the money went to his attorney for \nlegal fees associated with the resolution of the estate. He also paid off a $25,000 loan from \na lifelong friend. (Tr. 36, 64.) He explained that he borrowed the funds from his friend \nbecause he had to find a new attorney to handle the dispute over his second wife\u2019s trust. \n(Tr. 66.) It is unclear whether some or all of this loan went to pay attorney fees over and \nabove the $40,000 paid in 2022. \nApplicant currently rents his living quarters at $700 a month, but he has to move out \nby the beginning of August 2022 because his landlord intends to renovate the upstairs.

The home is too \nfar from his work for him to commute to work, so he rented it out for years until 2017. He \ncould not afford needed repairs to the property so it sat vacant (Tr. 54.) He fell behind \nabout $7,500 on the property taxes. He paid some of the back taxes in April or May 2021 \nand the rest in 2022, using some of the money he received from his second wife\u2019s estate. \n(GE 1; Tr. 36, 64.) He took $12,000 to $14,000 of the $108,000 received from her estate to \nfix up the property so he could rent it out. (Tr. 64-65.) A tenant signed a lease on the \nproperty in February 2022. Applicant pays around $575 a month on the mortgage for the \nproperty (Tr. 54-56) and is paid $825 per month in rent. (Tr. 90.)

(Tr. 49, 123.) \nApplicant is currently negotiating with the creditor that had charged-off $20,138 in \nloan debt (not alleged in SOR) that has been unaddressed since 2018. (GE 3.) On March \n3, 2022, the collection entity holding the debt was willing to settle the debt for $10,069. (AE \nH.) Applicant testified that he was alternatively offered a loan that would include the more \nthan $20,000 he owes. (Tr. 141-143.) He has made no payments on that debt. After his \nhearing, he retained the services of a credit-repair firm to correct his credit record and \nbegin the process of repairing his credit. (AE I.) He provided no details about that \narrangement or any no documentation in that regard. \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his defense-contractor employment is $177,000. He \nreceived incremental wage increases over the years. (Tr. 151-152.) Over the past year, he \nhas had about $2,900 in monthly discretionary income after paying his living expenses, \nwhich he testified has gone to paying off some debts and repairing his property so he can \nrent it out. Prior to that time, his wages were being garnished for his parent student loans at \n$1,500 a month. As of May 2022, he had about $3,000 in checking-account deposits and \n$900 in savings. He has almost $300,000 in 401(k) assets. (Tr. 89-92.) He has not had any \ncredit counseling. (Tr. 95.) \nApplicant has no record of violating security requirements. (Tr. 38, 157-158.)

(AE I; Tr. 158.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant asserts that he incurred only the student \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j), the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and the jewelry debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The \ncollection debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g were apparently \nmedical procedures for his estranged third wife, and he does not intend to repay the debts \nunless he is legally required to do so. He asserts that she ran up the credit-card balances \non the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f after he had brought the balances on those \naccounts to zero in 2016. The $146 utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k was for his spouse\u2019s \napartment. As for the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he testified that she somehow managed to \nobtain a loan using his credit without his knowledge. Regarding the judgment debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.l, Applicant explained that she fraudulently forged an old check that was dishonored by \nhis bank. He presented no documentation showing that she forged a check, abused his \ncredit without his knowledge, or that he is not legally liable for the debts in his name. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile the Government bears the burden of production on controverted issues of fact \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the Appeal Board has long held that a credit report is \nnormally sufficient to meet the Government\u2019s burden of producing substantial evidence of \nindebtedness. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). All debts \nbut the judgment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) are listed on one or more of the credit reports in \nevidence. Absent evidence showing that he is not legally liable for any of the debts in the \nSOR, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to the SOR debts, including the $186 medical \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and the $146 utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k), which were no longer on his credit \nreport as of April 2022. \nIn addition to the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant defaulted on a loan that \nhas a delinquent balance of $20,138. Since the loan was not alleged, it cannot be \nconsidered for disqualification purposes. Nonetheless it can be properly considered for \nother purposes. The Appeal Board has held that conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered for limited purposes, such as assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; considering \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or providing evidence for \nthe whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nThe debt is relevant to assessing whether his financial situation has changed significantly \nto where it no longer presents a security risk. \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by the delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The \nfollowing may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant asserts that the circumstances that led to his \nindebtedness will not recur because he is in the process of divorcing his wife, whose \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial irresponsibility and abuse of his credit to obtain money to support her drug habit \ncaused him extreme financial duress. Applicant did not provide an explanation for how his \nwife managed to obtain a car loan in his name without his knowledge. His explanation that \nshe forged an old check of his on a closed account is reasonable. Even so, the evidence \nshows that he continued to allow his wife to access his credit after he began to question \nsome of her purchases. His belief that he was honoring his marriage is insufficient \njustification for allowing her to run up balances on credit cards to the point where he could \nno longer maintain the minimum payments. He testified that he argued with her over her \nspending, but it appears that he gave in to her threats that she would end their relationship \nif he cut off her access to his credit. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) also cannot fully apply because of the recency of the delinquencies. \nWhile the student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j) and the utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k) have been \nsufficiently resolved to where they are no longer a source of financial pressure for him, \nApplicant has not made any payments on the other debt balances, including the small \nclaims court judgment. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course \nof conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, \n2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially mitigating to the extent that Applicant\u2019s finances were \nnegatively impacted by his second wife\u2019s medical expenses, which caused him to take on \nmortgage debt to pay off credit-card balances. He testified that he had to pay for two \nmortgages on the house he had shared with his second wife, even though he was not on \nthe property deed. He incurred some $43,000 in legal expenses in the contest over her \ntrust. The legal fees were outstanding until the estate was settled in early 2022. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso applies in that his third wife incurred debt in his name without his knowledge, including \nby surreptitiously obtaining his credit-card account information. \nYet Applicant\u2019s financial problems cannot fully be attributable to circumstances \noutside of his control. Grief over his second wife\u2019s death explains a somewhat hasty \nmarriage to a woman 29 years younger who took advantage of him, but he chose to \nsupport his third wife\u2019s desire to live apart during their marriage. He paid her living \nexpenses and daycare for her child for at least two years while some of his financial \naccounts became delinquent and were charged off. He did not act expeditiously to cut off \nher access to his credit. He knowingly incurred the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but contends that \nthe creditor acted in bad faith by repossessing his vehicle, asserting that he made a \npayment to catch up on the loan the day before the vehicle was repossessed. However, he \nalso acknowledged, and his credit reports show, that he made either partial or late loan \npayments leading to a history of chronic delinquency on the car loan. His parent student \nloans became seriously delinquent in December 2018 because he gave priority to paying \nfor multiple drug-rehabilitation programs for his third wife. Her drug problem was outside of \nhis control. However, it is difficult to conclude that Applicant acted fully financially \nresponsibly as he lacks a track record of timely efforts to work with his creditors toward \nresolving or settling his financial issues. Despite the passage of three years since he and \nhis third wife separated, he has made little progress toward several of the debts of concern \nto the DOD. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies to the student loan debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j), but the lender had to \nresort to garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages to collect on the loans. Applicant did not contest \nthe garnishment, but it was involuntary in that the creditor had to pursue him for the money. \nThe Appeal Board has held that resolution through garnishment \u201cdiminishes the [mitigating] \nweight to which the evidence is entitled.\u201d See ISCR Case Np. 14-05803 (App. Bd. July 7, \n2016). \nEvidence of good-faith efforts to address his debts under AG \u00b6 20(d) is limited. Only \nvery recently, he retained the services of credit-repair company to correct his credit record \nand begin the process of repairing his credit. To the extent that Applicant has been trying to \nsettle his debts on his own, he presented settlement offers for two accounts: the unalleged \n$20,138 defaulted personal loan and the $25,033 credit-card delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He \nhas no current payment plans in place for more than $100,000 in delinquent debts, \nincluding about $82,373 owed on SOR debts. He has known since he received the SOR in \nJuly 2021 that his delinquent accounts were of concern to the DOD. Of the $108,000 in \nsettlement from his second wife\u2019s estate, $40,000 to $43,000 went to legal fees; $12,000 to \n$14,000 went to repair the home from his first marriage so that he could rent it out; and \n$25,000 went to pay off a personal loan from a longtime friend. While he could not afford \nlump-sum payoffs, it appears that he had some funds to put toward his old debts. \nApplicant\u2019s continued disregard of the court judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.l) is evidence of ongoing \nquestionable judgment. However valid his indignation over his third wife\u2019s behavior may be, \nhe has not disproven his legal liability for the debts incurred in his name. \nThe Appeal Board has held that the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to \nhis fitness or suitability to handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR Case No. \n09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). The Appeal Board has also held that an applicant \nmust demonstrate \u201ca plan for debt payment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, \nconduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, \n2018). While this can be read as requiring debt repayment for mitigation, it is consistent \nwith the Appeal Board position in ISCR Case No. 09-02160 in that a person who ignores \nlegitimate financial obligations without reasonable justification does not display the good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of person\u2019s entrusted with the Nation\u2019s \nsensitive information. It appears that Applicant has delayed taking action to address his \ndebts in the hope that his creditors will accept less in settlement as more time passes. To \nthe extent that he has given priority to his self-interest over his repayment obligations, \nApplicant undermines his case in mitigation of the financial considerations security \nconcerns. More progress is needed toward resolving his debt issues to fully mitigate the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant is a longtime defense-contractor employee whose financial situation \ndeteriorated because of some factors over which he had no control. He was taken \nadvantage of financially and emotionally by his third wife, who had a heroin problem. Slow \nin rectifying the situation, he requests more time to address the issues of security concern. \nAppendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative \njudge\u2019s the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security \nclearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not completely \nmitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See, also, Memorandum, \nDirector for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January 12, 2018, \n(\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position. . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated within Appendix C is granted to \nany adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance \neligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \nAfter carefully considering and weighing the financial considerations security \nconcerns, I find that Applicant has not demonstrated that he can be counted on to timely \nrectify those debts for which he is legally liable but does not feel he should have to repay. \nHe has not made enough voluntary progress toward addressing the issues of security \nconcern to warrant exercise of the discretionary authority under Appendix C at this time. It \nis well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of \nrecord, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2010 to 2013. He remarried in 2018. He has a nine-year-old child from a relationship. He served in the military from 2009 to 2015 and received an honorable discharge. He has been steadily employed since his discharge from the military. He has worked for a federal contractor since February 2019. The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $67,887. Applicant admitted in his answer to the SOR that he owed the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($17,307), 1.d ($11,712) and 1.e ($7,906).

The \ncase was assigned to me on March 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e, and denied 1.b, 1.c, \n1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. His admissions are incorporated in the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He was married from 2010 to 2013. He remarried in \n2018. He has a nine-year-old child from a relationship. He served in the military from 2009 \nto 2015 and received an honorable discharge. He has been steadily employed since his \ndischarge from the military. He has worked for a federal contractor since February 2019. \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $67,887. Applicant \nadmitted in his answer to the SOR that he owed the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($17,307), 1.d \n($11,712) and 1.e ($7,906). He denied owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($13,227), 1.c \n($13,062), 1.f ($3,247), 1.g ($1,187) and 1.h ($239). All the delinquent debts are \ncorroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his security clearance applications (SCA) from \nMay 2015 and March 2020; statements made to government investigators in May 2015, \nJune 2015, and June 2020; credit reports from January 2022, May 2020 and May 2015; \nand his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11; AE \nA) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2013 divorce and a period when \nhe was transitioning from the military to civilian life from 2015 to 2016. In his SOR answer, \nhe stated he was forced to decide between satisfying his financial obligations and paying \nfor necessities, such as food and rent. He further stated that since the period of his \nfinancial difficulty, he has lived within his means, purchased a house, supported his \nfamily, and is paying his financial obligations. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2010. In it he \ndisclosed he had accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed and had been 180 days delinquent on debt(s). He noted that for most \nof the debts he was making payments on, he had reached a settlement, was pending a \nsettlement, or he was disputing.1  (Items 9, 10) \n1 Any derogatory information that was not alleged will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may \nbe considered in the application of mitigating conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a \nwhole-person analysis. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant completed another SCA. In it he did not disclose any \nfinancial delinquencies under section 26. (Item 7) In the final remarks section he stated: \nI [have had] a large amount of debt in the past. I am currently working as \nhard as I can to clean up my financial state and am making significant \nheadway. I am also currently transitioning from Active Duty Military status \nto a civilian life. My debts have piled up once again but I fully anticipate to \nbe fully up to date on my debts and payments by [2015-09-01] due to my \nincreased income and lower financial responsibilities. (Item 7) \nIn July 2015, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He was \nasked about a judgment that he began making payments on in 2009 and indicated he \nwould look into it and resume payments in 2016. He was confronted with the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a (creditor-ABC), and he explained it was a credit card debt. He used the \ncredit card in the past few years to pay for whatever his needs or wants were. He fell \nbehind due to moving and other expenses. He planned to contact the creditor and make \nthe bill current. He was also asked about SOR \u00b6 1.e. He explained it was for a loan he \nobtained in 2014 from ABC. He did not offer any other information about this loan to the \ninvestigator. (Item 11) \nThe government investigator confronted Applicant with four debts to the same \ncreditor (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f and 1.g-creditor XYZ). One was for a loan for a motorcycle, \nanother was a debt consolidation loan, and the two remaining were for credit cards. He \ntold the investigator that he was current on these debts. He said he planned to sell the \nmotorcycle and move to a less expensive apartment. He told the investigator that he \nbelieved his financial situation was due to carelessness and neglect. He had no one to \nblame, but the contributing factors of his divorce, unexpected child support, and reduction \nin rank had an impact. He understood he made some missteps in the last ten years on \nhis way to becoming an adult. He learned from the experiences, and the lessons will \nimprove his future. (Item 11) \nIn March 2020, Applicant completed an SCA. Regarding his finances, he stated \nthat he was disputing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. It was for a repossessed vehicle, \nand he believed the creditor had violated state law by failing to notify him within 48 hours \nto remove his personal effects from the vehicle. He noted that the state statute of \nlimitations applied, and he would be forced to hire legal representation to have the debt \nremoved from his credit report or wait until it was removed due to its age. In his SOR \nanswer, Applicant reiterated his position and also stated that \u201cpayment arrangements to \nbring the account to current and paid status had been made the previous night via phone \ncorrespondence.\u201d Presumably he made these arrangements the night before the vehicle \nwas repossessed. (Item 3) He said that this debt was due to his 2013 divorce and 2015-\n2016 transition from the military to civilian life. He stated: \u201cI was unable to meet my \nfinancial obligations at that time.\u201d (Item 3). In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated \nthe debt is still in dispute. Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence to \ncorroborate that he has disputed the debt and is not responsible for it.

He stated:  \nUpon my transition from active duty service with the [military service], I \nmade poor financial decisions. I lived beyond my means for a time post-\ndivorce while on active duty while continuing this trend in the months that \nfollowed after transitioning. (Item 4) \nHe further stated: \nI currently have negative accounts with both [XYZ] and [ABC]. At this point, \nI am simply waiting for these accounts to fall off of my credit report. I have \nhad no contact from these institutions in several years. (Item 4) \nIn his 2020 SCA, regarding the credit card accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g, \nApplicant stated that the accounts were closed and he had no contact with the creditors \nin several years. He acknowledged the debts were still active, and he was looking for \noptions to settle the debts, including researching a credit repair or counseling service to \nhave a third party negotiate a lower settlement amount. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he admitted owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e \nstating he could not pay these accounts because of his 2013 divorce and 2015 to 2016 \ntransition from the military. He stated he was working on negotiations with the creditor to \nsettle the debts since his financial situation had improved. (Item 3) In his response to the \nFORM, he refers to the debts as \u201csupposed outstanding debts\u201d and states the debts are \nreported by one credit bureau (CB) and not by another CB, so he is going to dispute the \ndebts. Applicant provided no evidence that he has paid, negotiated settlements to pay \nthese debts, or is not responsible for these debts to which he has repeatedly admitted to \nowing. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e are unresolved. (AE B, C) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied the debts owed to XYZ (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c. 1.f \nand 1.g). He stated that the creditor discharged the debts and the amounts were reported \nas income to the IRS in 2018 for which he paid federal and state taxes. In his FORM \nresponse, he stated the debts were removed from his credit report. He provided a copy \nof his 2018 tax transcripts that reflect the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f were reported as \ndischarged debts and included as income on his 2018 tax return. The transcripts did not \nreflect the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b or 1.g were canceled and reported. There is no evidence \nApplicant paid or attempted to pay any of the debts owed to XYZ. (Item 3; AE B, D, E) \nApplicant provided a document to show that in November 2016, he paid the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. It is resolved. (AE A). \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer and response to the FORM, he states that since he \nhad financial problems in 2015-2016, he has purchased a house, has two car payments \non new vehicles that are current, supports his family and ensures his bills are paid timely. \nHe believes the credit reports used for the SOR are outdated, flawed and mistaken.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a long history of not meeting financial obligations beginning in at \nleast 2015. He has numerous delinquent debts totaling over $67,000 that he has been \naware of for many years and repeatedly indicated he was addressing them, but failed to \ndo so, despite his claim that he is in a good financial position. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant has not provided evidence that he has paid any of the alleged delinquent \ndebts, except the small debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. His debts are recent and ongoing. He has \nrepeatedly indicated that he was addressing his delinquent debts, but provided no \nsubstantive evidence to corroborate any action taken. His behavior casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2013 divorce and a period in 2015 \nto 2016, when he was transitioning out of the military. These factors were beyond his \ncontrol. He also attributed it to living beyond his means, carelessness, and neglecting his \nfinances. These factors were within his control. Applicant has been aware of the debts \nalleged in the SOR since 2015. He failed to provide evidence of his actions to pay the \ndebts, but indicated he was waiting for them to drop off his credit report. He indicated that \nsome were resolved because the amounts he defaulted on were reported as canceled \ndebts and reported as income on his tax returns in 2018. None of these things reflect that \nApplicant acted responsibly. To the contrary, waiting for a debt to become unenforceable \nthrough the statute of limitations reflects that Applicant is unreliable. Having a debt \ncanceled and reported as taxable income is not the same as paying the amount due and \nacting responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling or that he \nresolved all of the financial allegations that were raised in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \nApplicant resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to that debt. \nThere is no evidence Applicant initiated or is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors. The fact that debts may have fallen off his credit report after seven \nyears for failing to pay them or having them canceled and included as income on his tax \nreturns is not a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply \nto the remaining delinquent debts. \nApplicant stated he was disputing the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but failed to \nprovide documented proof as to the legitimacy of his dispute or evidence of any actions \nhe may have taken to resolve the issue. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has had many years to resolve the debts alleged. He indicated that he \nis in a good financial position and his past debts do not reflect his current finances. Two \nof his debts were resolved by the creditor when it canceled the debts and reported them \nto the IRS to be included as income. This is not the same as paying the debt. Applicant \npaid one small debt. For the remainder of the debts, he failed to provide evidence that he \npaid, settled, or resolved them. Instead, he is relying on the statute of limitations and \nremoval of them from his credit report to indicate he is no longer responsible for the debts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board provides a summary regarding \u201cnon-collectable\u201d debts: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitations, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in making a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan 19, 2011) \nApplicant\u2019s argument that the credit reports used by the Government to \ncorroborate his delinquent debts are flawed and mistaken because the debts have \ndropped off is disingenuous. Applicant has repeatedly acknowledged owing the debts and \nclaimed he was negotiating settlements to pay them. Applicant failed to meet his burden \nof persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On June 28, \n2022, the case was assigned to me. On July 14, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for September 8, \n2022. (HE 1A) On August 30, 2022, the hearing was delayed to September 9, 2022, to \nenable Applicant\u2019s witness to be available for the hearing. (AE 1B) The first session was \nheld on September 9, 2022. (Transcript 1 (Tr1.) The hearing was continued to September \n12, 2022, to enable a witness to complete his statement. (Transcript 1 (Tr1. 49-52; Tr2.) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the Microsoft \nTeams video teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered \neight exhibits; there were no objections to the Government\u2019s Exhibits and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits A, B, F, G, and H; and those proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr1. \n18-19, 23-25; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, AE B, AE F, AE G, and AE H) Department \nCounsel initially objected to AE C, AE D, and AE E pertaining to serotonin syndrome \nbecause of a lack of a foundation showing relevance. (Tr1. 25) Dr. D, a clinical \npsychologist, reviewed the articles in the context of his evaluation of Applicant. (Tr1. 47) \nDepartment Counsel withdrew his objections to AE C and AE D. (Tr1. 48) At the hearing, \nI initially sustained Department Counsel\u2019s objection to AE E, an article on the Mayo Clinic \nwebsite, because the author of the information was not displayed. (Tr1. 48-49) On further \nconsideration, I overruled the objection and admitted AE E. (Tr2. 49-50) The absence of \nauthor information goes to the weight and not the admissibility of the website information. \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) pages 160-168, 202-208, \n222-226, 233, 655-659, and 672-675, and the Medication Guide for Paxil; there was no \nobjection; and I granted the administrative notice requests regarding DSM-5. (Tr1. 20-22; \nHE 4) The Medication Guide for Paxil was admitted as GE 7 without objection. (Tr1. 22-\n23; GE 7) On September 19, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. \nI excluded some details to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific information \nis available in the cited exhibits. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.c, and 1.d.

SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges and Applicant admitted from May 2016 to January \n2017, he received treatment at a civilian medical care provider. (Tr1. 124; HE 2, HE 3) \nHe said he was unaware that he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social \nanxiety disorder, schizotypal personal disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. (HE 2, \nHE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges and Applicant admitted in December 2020, a licensed \npsychologist evaluated him. (HE 2; HE 3) He said he was unaware of the psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of major depressive disorder, unspecified anxiety disorder, and schizotypal \npersonality disorder. (HE 3) The psychologist concluded his condition may impair his \njudgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. (HE 2) \nApplicant is a 38-year-old software engineer who worked for a DOD contractor \ninitially in 2019 as an intern. (Tr1. 54, 74) He worked full time for the DOD contractor since \nAugust 2020. (Tr1. 86) He has never married, and he does not have children. (Tr1. 138) \nApplicant described his own personality as \u201chighly introverted.\u201d (Tr1. 137) \nWhen Applicant was a teenager, he participated in 4H. He achieved a second-\ndegree black belt in Tae Kwon Do (Korean karate). (Tr1. 56) In 2008, he was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. (Tr1. 56, 79) While he was in college, he \nput cigarettes out on his hand three or four times to show how tough he was. (Tr1. 90-91) \nAfter graduating from college with a 4.0 grade point average, he was unemployed from \nMay of 2008 to September 2010. (Tr1. 79) From 2010 to 2012, a store employed him as \na security guard for about 30 months. (Tr1. 57, 70, 79-80; GE 1) Applicant described two \nphysical altercations he had with a female employee. In the first one, he was injured; \nhowever, he did not report her for shoving him. In the second altercation, she pushed him \nfirst, and he pushed her back. (Tr1. 58) His employer fired him for engaging in a physical \naltercation with her. (Tr1. 57-59) On his February 12, 2019 SCA, he said he was fired for \na \u201cverbal dispute\u201d with a coworker. (GE 1 at 17) The woman in the altercation was taller \nand heavier than Applicant. (Tr1. 59-60) He was unemployed from May 2012 to July 2014. \n(Tr1. 83) \nApplicant has numerous relatives who were veterans of the U.S. military. (Tr1. 61) \nIn 2014, he joined the Army when he was 30 years old. (Tr1. 60-61) In basic training, he \nhad suicidal thoughts, felt depressed, and had panic attacks. (Tr1. 93-94) In basic \ntraining, he was awarded the expert marksman badge, and he was promoted to specialist \n(E-4) because he had a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr1. 62, 92) At his personal appearance, he \ndenied that he cut himself or did anything to hurt himself while he was in basic training. \n(Tr1. 94, 96) However, his medical records reflect that he began cutting himself while he \nwas in basic training. (GE 5 at 114) Applicant said the person who made the comment in \nhis medical records about him cutting himself may have misinterpreted something he \nsaid.

(Tr1. 62) \nOCS was stressful for him, and he had suicidal ideations, panic attacks, and probably \ndepression. (Tr1. 63, 97) He disclosed the suicidal ideations to student leadership; they \ntook him to the duty officer; and then he went to the hospital. (Tr1. 64, 97-98) He was \nunder observation at the hospital for an hour or two, and then he was sent back to OCS. \n(Tr1. 64) The next morning, he was terminated from OCS. (Tr1. 64) He remained in a \nholding company after being discharged from the OCS course. (Tr1. 65) He initially \nrefused antidepressants because he was worried that they would increase his suicidal \nideations. (Tr1. 64) Later he tried several medications to treat anxiety. (Tr1. 98) One \nmedication was changed because he had nightmares. (Tr1. 65) \nApplicant was transferred from his OCS installation to an installation in the United \nStates for advanced individual training (AIT), where he was trained to be a chaplain\u2019s \nassistant. (Tr1. 99) While in AIT, he finished his anxiety medication, and he did not seek \na refill of his anxiety medication. (Tr1. 101) In AIT, he had suicidal ideations, anxiety, and \ndepression. (Tr1. 99) As for his method of committing suicide, he considered using a \nGerber knife to cut his femoral or brachial arteries. (Tr1. 142) \nIn January or February 2015, Applicant went to his first non-training assignment, \nwhich was at an installation in the United States. (Tr1. 102) Early in 2015, he sought \nmental-health treatment for suicidal ideations, anxiety, and depression. (Tr1. 102) He had \ndifficulties with stress caused by being on an Army installation. (Tr1. 102) He felt anxiety \nwhen he was responsible for making arrangements for events such as meetings and \nprayer luncheons. (Tr1. 107) He felt anxiety most days, and sometimes he experienced \nspikes of anxiety throughout the day. (Tr1. 107) The anxiety spikes would last from a few \nminutes to more than an hour, and he felt squeezing in his chest and brain, an increased \nheart rate, jitteriness, and occasionally he bit the inside of his cheek. (Tr1. 108) He was \nprescribed Paxil, Buspar, Abilify, and propranolol. (Tr1. 102-103, 109) He took all of these \nmedications every day. (Tr1. 109) \nIn 2015, Applicant was superficially cutting his chest and his back with his Gerber \nknife, and he had audio and visual hallucinations (AVH). (Tr1. 103-106, 143) In \nSeptember 2015, a noncommissioned officer observed the cuts on his back, and he took \nApplicant to the emergency room. (Tr1. 111, 113) The emergency room examined the \ncuts and released him. (Tr1. 113) He did not receive stiches. (Tr1. 113) He was unsure \nwhy he cut himself; however, he suggested the cuttings could be a side effect from \nmedications or possibly situational. (Tr1. 104-105) It could also have been because \ncutting himself was something he could control, or perhaps he was replacing emotional \npain with physical pain. (Tr1. 105) \nApplicant\u2019s visual hallucinations were of the pony character from a cartoon called \nMy Little Pony, and the pony\u2019s name was Rainbow Dash. (Tr1. 109) He told his providers \nthat the Rainbow Dash image was soothing. (Tr1. 110) Sometimes Rainbow Dash would \ntalk to him. (Tr1. 110) In July 2015, he had a \u201cdistressing\u201d vision of the face of the Joker \nfrom Batman coming at him. (Tr1. 110) Applicant\u2019s medical records indicate on \nSeptember 11, 2015, Applicant forgot to take his Paxil and Buspar, and he had \u201cparanoid \ndelusions about bombs being planted in trailers.\u201d (Tr1. 114-115; GE 5 at 14) At his \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nhearing, Applicant denied having a memory about bombs in a trailer.

(Tr1. 116-117) He took his Buspar, and he was able to calm down and sleep that \nnight despite the AVH. (Tr1. 117) \nOn December 22, 2015, Applicant saw a man with a woman he liked. (Tr1 117) He \nfelt suicidal, and he had a friend take him to the emergency room. (Tr1. 117) In his \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical records, he said, \u201c\u2018I was seeing rainbow \ndash and heard voice at that time, had plan to use a knife to cut wrist or brachial arteries.\u2019\u201d \nThe records note a \u201c[diagnosis including] schizotypal personality disorder and social \nanxiety.\u201d (GE 6 at 23) Applicant was an inpatient for a week in a military mental health \nfacility following his visit to the emergency room. (Tr1. 119) \nOn December 29, 2015, the Army\u2019s primary diagnoses were Anxiety Disorder \nunspecified, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder. (GE 5 at 115) \nThe December 29, 2015 note states: \nSM endorses AVH 2-3 times a week. SM elaborates that he often sees a \ncharacter from a popular children\u2019s animated TV show, and says the \ncharacter is benign and gives him encouragement and positive feedback. \nSM acknowledges this character is not real, and adds that it sometimes \nworries him that he is seeing and hearing it. SM denies command \nencouraging him to self-harm, but recounts an instance when he did not \ntake his medication and experienced AVH which were \u201cscary, and told me \nto do bad stuff\u201d. . . SM endorses self-harm behavior, and elaborates he cuts \nhimself superficially on the chest back about once a week using a Gerber \ntool. SM says his cutting gives him a sense of release and that he began \ncutting during basic training. (GE 5 at 114) \nOn January 26, 2016, Applicant completed a checklist and indicated he had special \npowers. (GE 5 at 69-70) At his hearing, he said he could not remember anything about \nthe special powers. (Tr1. 122-123) In April 2016, he was administratively discharged from \nthe Army. (Tr1. 66, 84) He could not remember the specific reason for the administrative \ndischarge; however, it could have been for a personality disorder. (Tr1. 141) When he left \nthe Army, he was taking Paxil, Buspar, Abilify, and propranolol. (Tr1. 123) He continued \nto take these four medication for several months after being discharged from the Army. \n(Tr1. 124) He did not receive a medical discharge or medical retirement from the Army, \nand he is not receiving VA disability pay.

(GE 6 at 7) A January 31, 2017 VA treatment \nnote indicates, \u201ccoping with symptoms, risk of relapse off medications.\u201d (GE 6 at 4) The \ndiagnosis was \u201cSocial anxiety disorder.\u201d (GE 6 at 6) \nIn June of 2018, Applicant did not get a good grade on an examination while he \nwas in college. He waited for about month, and he slashed two tires on a neighbor\u2019s \nvehicle. Applicant described the incident as follows: \nWell, there was a neighbor across the street, they had an SUV with an \noverly sensitive alarm. Sometimes they go off for no reason. And well, \nduring that class, I had an exam, and it went off three times in one hour the \nnight before the exam, and in that exam, I got a D. The first time I've ever \ngot a grade even close to that low in higher education. So that night, you \nknow, it was going off again, I was upset, drunk, and I made the horribly \nregrettable decision to go across the street and slash two of their tires. (Tr. \n72) \nApplicant said he felt guilty about what he had done, and he paid for the repairs for the \nvehicle plus a couple hundred dollars. (Tr. 73) His neighbor did not report the incident to \nthe police. (Tr1. 128-129) During his June 18, 2019 Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) interview, he said he was still having brief suicidal thoughts. (Tr1. 129)  \nOn January 11, 2021, Dr. B, who is a licensed clinical psychologist, issued a report \nrelating to Applicant\u2019s mental health at the request of the DOD CAF. (GE 3 at 1) Applicant \ntold Dr. B that he was discharged from the Army for \u201crequiring a prescription for a non-\ndeployable medication.\u201d (Id. at 2) He was not currently prescribed mental-health \nmedications. (Id.) He had not had mental-health treatment or counseling since leaving VA \ntreatment, and he did not believe he needed treatment. (Id. at 3) He most recently had \nthoughts of suicide after receiving a B in a course in 2018. (Id.) As for the AVH, Applicant \ntold Dr. B: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring 2015, [Applicant] had some psychotic symptoms. He would see a \nMy Little Pony character, Rainbow Dash, most of the time. He reported that \nhe enjoyed watching My Little Ponies because he found it calming. When \nstressed, he would see this pony out of the corner of his eye, and the pony \nwould tell him calming/reassuring things and then disappear. There were, \nhowever, a couple [of] incidents where he heard voices telling him to hurt \nhimself and once he saw something biting his head. (GE 3 at 3) \nDr. B\u2019s diagnoses were as follows: \u201cMajor depressive disorder, recurrent, severe \nwith psychotic features in full remission; Unspecified anxiety disorder; and Schizotypal \npersonality disorder.\u201d (GE 3 at 5) She explained the schizotypal personality disorder as \nfollows: \nThis included unusual thinking, perceptions, and beliefs; lack of close \nfriends outside of his family of origin; unusual emotional responses; and \nexcessive social discomfort. While some of his personality traits are \nunusual, they would not preclude his ability to maintain security of sensitive \ninformation appropriately. He does appear quite anxious, and could be \npersuaded to share information through manipulation. His depression is in \nremission, and might remain so, given that it occurred only during his \nmilitary experience; however, it is plausible that it would recur during other \ntimes of stress. \n[Applicant\u2019s] prognosis is guarded overall. He is doing well compared to \nprior times of great emotional distress. Still, he does have conditions of \nanxiety and depression that have been quite severe at times and might \nrecur. Therefore, if not in treatment, I would have concerns regarding his \njudgment, stability, and trustworthiness. . . . [Applicant] would benefit from \nregular treatment for his emotional distress and personality disorder. This \nwould mitigate my concerns that his conditions could impede his functioning \nwith regard to possessing protected information. (GE 3 at 5) \nDr. D was a witness on Applicant\u2019s behalf at his hearing. Dr. D is a clinical and \nforensic psychologist who is board certified in clinical psychology. (Tr1. 27-28) He served \non active duty in the Navy for five years, and he has been in private practice since 2008. \n(Tr1. 28) He has done thousands of security-related evaluations for federal entities, \nincluding DOD and the Navy, states, municipalities, and private companies. (Tr1. 29-30) \nHe spent at least three hours interviewing Applicant, and he examined medical records, \nDr. B\u2019s report, and the results of psychological tests. (Tr1. 32-33, Tr2. 27) \nDr. D informed Applicant before the interview that there was no confidentiality, and \nif Applicant said anything negative, he would have to report the information. (Tr2. 27) Dr. \nD noted that Applicant had, \u201cA distinct tendency toward avoiding self disclosure [which] \nis evident in this patient's response style.\u201d (AE A at 7) Nevertheless, Dr. D believed that \nApplicant\u2019s self-report to him of the current absence of hallucinations was accurate \nbecause usually hallucinations are accompanied by body language such as scanning the \nroom with eyes due to paranoia, and Applicant did not show behavior consistent with \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nparanoia. (Tr2. 26) A person with hallucinations usually believes hallucinations are real; \nhowever, when Applicant previously had hallucinations, he was aware they were not real. \n(Tr2. 26) Dr. D did not explain why Applicant would be paranoid if he believed the \nhallucinations about Rainbow Dash were not real and were soothing. \nDr. D said the psychological tests showed Applicant was minimally depressed and\nhe had low anxiety. (Tr1. 34) There was no evidence of alcohol use or abuse of illegal \ndrugs. (Tr1. 34) The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-IV (MCMI-IV) test showed \n\u201csomewhat of a defensive profile;\u201d however, the test was still valid. (Tr1. 35) The MCMI-\nIV test did not indicate a personality disorder. (Tr1. 35) He had some peaks during the \ntest; however, he considered Applicant to be in the normal, healthy range. (Tr1. 36) His \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI) showed a \u201cvery defensive\u201d profile; however, this \nprofile was not significant enough to invalidate the test. (Tr1. 38; Tr2. 10-11, 17) He was \n\u201ctwo standard deviations above the mean for defensiveness.\u201d (Tr2. 17) Dr. D concluded \nApplicant\u2019s high level of compulsiveness enabled Dr. D to validate Applicant\u2019s PAI. (Tr2. \n18) The PAI showed no psychopathology and the results were within normal limits. (Tr1. \n38) However, the defensiveness indicated a reluctance to disclose information, and the \nPAI administered for Dr. B\u2019s evaluation did not report this defensiveness. (Tr2. 14-15, 18) \nHe readily disclosed information to the Army about his dreams and hallucinations that \nmost people would not freely disclose. (Tr2. 15)\n \n \nDr. D reviewed Dr. B\u2019s report, and he disagreed with her findings and conclusions. \n(Tr1. 40) Dr. D believed Dr. B was influenced by \u201cdiagnostic momentum phenomenon\u201d in \nwhich she \u201cbasically rubber stamped\u201d the diagnosis in Applicant\u2019s medical records. (Tr1. \n39-40; AE A at 6-7) Dr. D concluded that there was a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that Applicant \nexperienced \u201cserotonin syndrome,\u201d which was caused by the interaction of three \npsychotropic medications, and serotonin syndrome contributed to or caused Applicant\u2019s \nmood changes and hallucinations. (Tr1. 41, 46; AE A at 7) The other causes could be \ndue to his medications or suicidal thoughts. (Tr1. 46) Serotonin could accentuate the \nnegative effects of other medications such as Paxil and Buspar. (Tr1. 41-42) He believed \nApplicant\u2019s perceptual disturbances started due to taking serotonin. (Tr1. 43) Dr. D did \nnot diagnose Applicant with serotonin syndrome because he is not Applicant\u2019s prescribing \npsychologist or psychiatrist. (Tr2. 7) \nApplicant told Dr. D that \u201csince leaving the Army, he has not seen Rainbow Dash \nagain. Applicant said once he left the Army things rapidly improved for him.\u201d (GE A at 3) \nHowever, the VA medical records indicate Applicant continued to see Rainbow Dash \nthroughout his VA treatment. In a subsequent visit with Dr. D, Applicant said that he had \nthe visual hallucinations for a couple of weeks after he stopped taking the medications; \nhowever, later in the interview, he told Dr. D \u201cthat all hallucinations he had were isolated \nto his military experience.\u201d (GE A at 13) \nAfter Applicant stopped taking serotonin the disturbances decreased, and a month \nor so later, the disturbances ended. (Tr1. 43) His hallucinations were brief and episodic \nand \u201conly occurred while he was on the medication.\u201d (Tr1. 44) Applicant told Dr. D in \nOctober 2021 that he was still having brief suicidal thoughts when he was feeling stress. \n(Tr1. 130, 131) Dr. D said that serotonin continues to affect a person for one or two weeks \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nafter the person stops taking it. (Tr2. 5) Serotonin syndrome can also occur from taking a \ncombination of other medications. (Tr2. 5) \nDr. D did not observe that Applicant\u2019s hallucinations were worse when he forgot to \ntake his medications. (Tr2. 8) Dr. D did not indicate in his report that Applicant slashed \nhis neighbor\u2019s tires. (Tr2. 11) Dr. D decided the tire-slashing incident was an outlier \nbecause there were no other alcohol-related incidents. (Tr2. 12, 19) He does not believe \nApplicant needs mental-health treatment. (Tr2. 24) \nDr. D described Applicant as having \u201ca rigid, compulsive, socially-anxious \npersonality.\u201d (Tr2. 19; GE A at 8) He had a significant adjustment disorder and an \nunspecified anxiety disorder when he was in the Army. (Tr2. 20, 23) Dr. D did not believe \nApplicant had a schizotypal diagnosis because he did not have magical thinking. (Tr2. \n22) Dr. D did not agree with the diagnosis of depression because Applicant did not exhibit \ndepression in a recurring fashion, that is, it did not occur pre-Army service or after his \ndischarge. (Tr2. 22) Dr. D was unable to diagnose Applicant with a mental-health or \npersonality disorder. (Tr2. 5-6, 20-21) He found Applicant to be psychologically fit to have \naccess to classified information. (Tr2. 7) Dr. D concluded: \nMoreover, I found no evidence of him having a major depressive disorder, \na psychotic disorder, or a schizotypal personality disorder, and to in fact \npresent very similarly to those in the computer science field working as \nsoftware engineers. These individuals are often introverted and less \ninterpersonally skilled. To be clear, I found no evidence to suggest any \nconcerns about his reliability, judgment, stability, or trustworthiness. I find \nhim psychologically suitable to handle, manage, and maintain classified \ninformation. (AE A at 15) \nApplicant lives alone. (Tr1. 86) He does not have family living in the state where \nhe lives. (Tr1. 86) He plans to move to the state where his family lives. (Tr1. 87-88) He \ndoes not have a significant other in his life, and he has not had an intimate relationship \nwith a significant other for about 10 years. (Tr1. 137) \nApplicant said in about 2019, the suicidal ideations stopped. (Tr1. 68-69; AE A at \n13) He said he had zero suicidal thoughts in 2022. (Tr1. 130) He has not had serious \nanxiety since May of 2020. (Tr1. 135) He does not experience problems sleeping. (Tr1. \n135) He has not cut himself for several years. (Tr1. 106) He has not had any homicidal \nideations. (Tr1. 120) He has not received mental-health treatment since January 31, \n2017.

(AE \nH) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c). Further details will be \ndiscussed in the mitigation analysis, infra. \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nOn December 22, 2015, Applicant saw someone with a woman he liked. He felt \nsuicidal, and he had a friend take him to the emergency room. He was an inpatient for \nmental-health treatment for about one week. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 29, 2015, the Army primary diagnosis was Anxiety Disorder \nunspecified, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder. (GE 5 at 115) \nA December 29, 2015 Army medical note states: \nSM endorses AVH 2-3 times a week. SM elaborates that he often sees a \ncharacter from a popular children\u2019s animated TV show, and says the \ncharacter is benign and gives him encouragement and positive feedback. \nSM acknowledges this character is not real, and adds that it sometimes \nworries him that he is seeing and hearing it. SM denies command \nencouraging him to self-harm, but recounts an instance when he did not \ntake his medication and experienced AVH which were \u201cscary, and told me \nto do bad stuff\u201d. . . SM endorses self-harm behavior, and elaborates he cuts \nhimself superficially on the chest back about once a week using a Gerber \ntool. SM says his cutting gives him a sense of release and that he began \ncutting during basic training. (GE 5 at 114) \nApplicant\u2019s VA medical records indicate that he said, \u201c\u2018I was seeing rainbow dash \nand heard voice at that time, had plan to use a knife to cut wrist or brachial arteries\u2019 . . . \nHe had [a diagnosis] with schizotypal personality disorder and social anxiety.\u201d (GE 6 at \n23) \nThis case involves conflicting expert opinions from Dr. B and Dr. D about \nApplicant\u2019s mental health diagnosis, need for treatment or therapy, prognosis, and \nApplicant\u2019s qualification for access to classified information. In ISCR Case No. 19-00151 \nat 8 (App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2019) the Appeal Board denied a government appeal and \naddressed the administrative judge\u2019s weighing of conflicting expert psychological \nopinions as follows: \nA Judge is required to weigh conflicting evidence and to resolve such \nconflicts based upon a careful evaluation of factors such as the comparative \nreliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting pieces of \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2007). \nA Judge is neither compelled to accept a DoD-required psychologist\u2019s \ndiagnosis of an applicant nor bound by any expert\u2019s testimony or report. \nRather, the Judge has to consider the record evidence as a whole in \ndeciding what weight to give conflicting expert opinions. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 98-0265 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999) and ISCR Case No. 99-\n0288 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2000). In this case, the Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat the magnitude and recency of Dr. Y\u2019s contacts with Applicant in \ncombination with other corroborating evidence merited more weight than \nthe uncorroborated opinions of Dr. K and Dr. B is sustainable. \nDr. D placed significant weight on the theories that Applicant\u2019s mental health issues \nwere caused by his medications or situational (due to being in the Army) or both. He \ntheorized that Applicant\u2019s medications because of serotonin could cause AVH. However, \none of Applicant\u2019s worst episodes was on September 11, 2015, when he forgot to take \nhis Paxil and Buspar. Moreover, before Applicant was prescribed medication, he cut \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhimself when he was in basic training and AIT, and he had suicidal ideations, panic \nattacks, and probably depression. In January 2017, Applicant had frequent VH more than \ntwo months after he stopped taking his medications. Dr. D conceded the serotonin effect \nwould not occur more than two weeks after he stopped taking his medications. The \nevidence does not establish that his medications caused his symptoms. \nDr. D had only three hours of interviews with Applicant, and he noted that Applicant \nwas defensive and reluctant to describe his symptoms. The Army and VA diagnoses are \nmore reliable than Dr. D\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis as they are based on more contacts \nwith Applicant. A December 29, 2015 Army medical primary diagnosis was Anxiety \nDisorder unspecified, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder. Dr. \nB\u2019s diagnosis was not exactly the same as the previous Army and VA diagnoses, and her \ndiagnosis was not improperly influenced by the previous Army and VA diagnoses. Dr. B \ndiagnosed Applicant with \u201cMajor depressive disorder, recurrent, severe with psychotic \nfeatures in full remission; Unspecified anxiety disorder; and Schizotypal personality \ndisorder.\u201d (GE 3 at 5) It is important to note that Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis indicated the major \ndepressive disorder was in remission. Dr. B and Dr. D observed that Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth improved after he left the Army, and this observation supports a conclusion that \nthere was a situational component, which was probably stress. One of Applicant\u2019s worst \nepisodes occurred after he observed someone he was romantically interested in with \nanother man. This situation or something similar could recur in the future and could result \nin Applicant having a relapse. \nDr. B opined: \n[Applicant\u2019s] prognosis is guarded overall. He is doing well compared to \nprior times of great emotional distress. Still, he does have conditions of \nanxiety and depression that have been quite severe at times and might \nrecur. Therefore, if not in treatment, I would have concerns regarding his \njudgment, stability, and trustworthiness. . . . [Applicant] would benefit from \nregular treatment for his emotional distress and personality disorder. This \nwould mitigate my concerns that his conditions could impede his functioning \nwith regard to possessing protected information. (GE 3 at 5)   \nThere is evidence of six events not alleged in the SOR which are relevant: (1) On \nhis February 12, 2019 SCA, Applicant said he was fired for a \u201cverbal dispute\u201d with a \ncoworker. (GE 1 at 17) This was not true because he was fired for shoving a female \ncoworker during an argument; (2) At his hearing, he denied that he cut himself or did \nanything to hurt himself while he was in basic training. (Tr1. 94, 96) However, his medical \nrecords reflect that he began cutting himself while he was in basic training. (GE 5 at 114); \n(3) At his hearing, he said after he left the Army, the AVH ended. (Tr1. 123) However, his \nVA medical records indicate his VH continued through the end of the VA treatments in \nJanuary 2017; (4) At his hearing, Applicant denied that he ever cut his wrist. (Tr1. 111-\n112) On May 9, 2016, Applicant told a VA psychiatrist that he showed a suicidal ideation \nand cut his wrist in July 2015. (GE 6 at 23) The psychiatrist\u2019s note states \u201cBecause too \nmuch stress from training and loneliness, I cried, was feeling kind of helpless, did a \nsuperficial wrist cut, then received a mental health assessment.\u201d (Tr1. 112; GE 6 at 22); \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(5) In June of 2018, Applicant did not get a good grade on an examination while he was \nin college, and a month later, he slashed the tires on his neighbor\u2019s vehicle because his \ncar alarm woke him up at night; and (6) Applicant told Dr. B that he was discharged from \nthe Army for \u201crequiring a prescription for a non-deployable medication.\u201d (GE 3 at 2) \nHowever, he was discharged from the Army because of a mental-health issue and not \nbecause of his medications. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), \nthe Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may \nbe considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); IS\n \nCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the six purposes listed above. \nApplicant states he has not had symptoms of security concern for at least two \nyears. He said he has no AVH, and denies suicidal ideations. The problem here is a \npersistent concern that Applicant is minimizing his symptoms to obtain a security \nclearance. Without a candid and forthright statement from Applicant describing his \nmental-health history and current mental status, I share Dr. B\u2019s concerns about whether \nApplicant would be able to protect classified information. Under a totality of the \ncircumstances, there is insufficient evidence to support mitigation of psychological \nconditions security concerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the whole-person concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the \ntotality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other variables. \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the determination of whether to grant a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that \nguideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old software engineer who worked for a DOD contractor \ninitially in 2019 as an intern. He has worked full time for the DOD contractor since August \n2020. When he was a teenager, he participated in 4H. He achieved a second-degree \nblack belt in Tae Kwon Do (Korean karate). In 2008, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin business administration, and he had a 4.0 grade point average. He honorably served \nin the Army from 2014 to 2016. In May 2020, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer \nscience with a 3.9 grade point average. \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluation working for his current employer is excellent.\nTwo supervisors, four coworkers, his mother, and his brother provided statements \nsupporting Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. The general sense of their \nstatements is that Applicant is honest, reliable, responsible, diligent, professional, and \ntrustworthy. Their statements support approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified \ninformation.\n \n \nThe DOD encourages employees to seek needed mental-health therapy and \ntreatment. As set forth in AG \u00b6 27, no negative inference is drawn on the basis of mental-\nhealth counseling. In that regard, no one chooses to have a mental illness, and individuals \nare to be encouraged to seek appropriate treatment. Applicant sought and received \ninpatient and outpatient mental-health treatment, and his participation in mental-health \ncounseling and treatments are mitigating. \nThe reasons for denial of his access to classified information are more persuasive \nat this time. As indicated in the psychological conditions section, Applicant has a lengthy \nhistory of mental-health issues beginning in 2014. His suicidal ideation, incidents of self \nharm, and AVH are concerning. Dr. B reasonably recommended ongoing counseling and \ntherapy in the event he has a reaction to a stressful situation or other symptoms resume. \nIn January 2017, he stopped seeking mental-health counseling and treatment. He is \nunlikely to have a stress free life. The lack of regularly scheduled ongoing therapy or \ncounseling sessions to assess his mental status results in lingering security concerns. \nThe record established that Applicant is an intelligent, caring, dedicated, professional, \nand diligent employee who will be an important asset to DOD upon full mitigation of \nsecurity concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nExec.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for her current employer or a predecessor contractor since 2016. She seeks to retain a security clearance, which she has held since about 2017. She is attending college but has not yet earned a degree. She married in 2010 and divorced in 2017. She has two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18-19, 28, 37-39; GE 1, 2) Applicant admitted that she and her ex-husband were reckless with their spending when they were younger. They took out a consolidation loan to pay their credit cards, and then had a difficult time maintaining the payments. They engaged the services of a debt-resolution company in 2016. They paid $1,000 per month into the company\u2019s debt-relief program (DRP) for a period, but Applicant was unable to continue the payments after her divorce, and she had to withdraw from the program. (Tr. at 18\u00ad 19, 26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) Neither Applicant nor her ex-husband used an attorney in their divorce, and Applicant accepted less in the division of assets and liabilities than she might otherwise have received, because she just wanted the marriage to end. She received all of the marital debt, including the debts in the SOR, except for one credit card debt. They maintain joint custody of their children, and neither party has to pay child support. He is supposed to pay half of the children\u2019s healthcare costs, but he rarely does. She maintains the health insurance for the child",

She has worked for \nher current employer or a predecessor contractor since 2016. She seeks to retain a \nsecurity clearance, which she has held since about 2017. She is attending college but \nhas not yet earned a degree. She married in 2010 and divorced in 2017. She has two \nchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18-19, 28, 37-39; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant admitted that she and her ex-husband were reckless with their \nspending when they were younger. They took out a consolidation loan to pay their credit \ncards, and then had a difficult time maintaining the payments. They engaged the \nservices of a debt-resolution company in 2016. They paid $1,000 per month into the \ncompany\u2019s debt-relief program (DRP) for a period, but Applicant was unable to continue \nthe payments after her divorce, and she had to withdraw from the program. (Tr. at 18\u00ad\n19, 26; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nNeither Applicant nor her ex-husband used an attorney in their divorce, and \nApplicant accepted less in the division of assets and liabilities than she might otherwise \nhave received, because she just wanted the marriage to end. She received all of the \nmarital debt, including the debts in the SOR, except for one credit card debt. They \nmaintain joint custody of their children, and neither party has to pay child support. He is \nsupposed to pay half of the children\u2019s healthcare costs, but he rarely does. She \nmaintains the health insurance for the children. (Tr. at 19-21, 28-30; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s finances stabilized for a period after her divorce. She and a partner \nshared a home and expenses, and she was able to start paying her debts again. He \nmoved out in 2019, and left her with a home she could not afford. She eventually was \nable to move into a cheaper home and resumed paying her debts. (Tr. at 19) \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts. However, the $357 debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h \nand 1.j are duplicate accounts. The 12 non-duplicate debts include a $47,242 \nconsolidation loan; 4 medical debts totaling $2,454; and 7 miscellaneous debts totaling \n$36,925. Applicant admitted owing all of the debts at one time, but she stated that she \npaid several debts and was in the process of paying others. \nApplicant settled and paid the $695 and $357 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n1.h in August 2021. (AE D, F) She paid the four medical debts totaling $2,454 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m) between July 2021 and December 2021. (Tr. at 24-25, 32-33; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE D-H) \nApplicant considered filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, but she was \nadvised that her disposable income was too great for a bankruptcy discharge. She \nreengaged the services of the debt-resolution company in December 2021. She \nenrolled four debts totaling $25,537 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.e) in the company\u2019s DRP. She \nagreed to pay the debt-resolution company $293 per month.

It is unclear who if anyone is currently collecting the debt. Applicant \nstated that the debt will be added to the DRP if a creditor is located. (Tr. at 21-26, 31\u00ad\n35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE C) \nApplicant contacted the creditor for the $47,242 defaulted consolidation loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). She agreed to pay $80 per month. She realizes that it will take a long time \nto pay the debt at that rate. She plans to add the debt to the DRP after other debts are \npaid. (TR. at 23-24, 30-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5-7; AE B) \nApplicant receives financial counseling from the debt-resolution company. She \nrealizes that her financial situation is not ideal, but it is improving. She is committed to \npaying her debts. She is responsible for two children, and she knows that financial \nsecurity is a necessary part of providing for them. Her ex-husband finally agreed to help \nwith the children\u2019s medical bills after she threatened to take him to court. (Tr. at 26, 29, \n35-40; AE C) \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to her excellent job performance and strong \nmoral character. She is praised for her dedication, honesty, trustworthiness, work ethic, \nreliability, and integrity. (AE I) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). SOR \u00b6 1.j is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that she and her ex-husband were reckless with their \nspending when they were younger. They attempted to resolve their financial issues \nthrough a DRP, but that proved impossible to maintain when they divorced in 2017. \nApplicant became responsible for almost all of the marital debt, and her ex-husband \nrarely paid his share of their children\u2019s healthcare costs. Applicant\u2019s finances stabilized \nfor a period after her divorce, but her partner moved out, leaving her with a home she \ncould not afford. \nApplicant moved into a cheaper home and resumed paying her debts. She paid \nsix debts; she has a payment plan for one debt; four debts are in the DRP; and the last \ndebt will be added to the DRP if a creditor is located. She credibly stated that she is \ncommitted to paying all of her debts and to eventually attain financial security. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant has a plan to resolve her financial problems, and she took significant \naction to implement that plan. She acted responsibly under the circumstances and \nmade a good-faith effort to pay her debts. It may take time, but I am convinced that she \nwill eventually resolve her financial problems.1 The above mitigating conditions are \nsufficiently applicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n1 See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 4 (App. \nBd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 38 years old. He was married and he has two children--one adult and one minor. He graduated from high school in 2002. He attended college from 2002 to 2003, in 2010, and in 2014, but he did not earn a degree. He obtained a certificate in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in 2020. As of his April 2020 SCA, he worked as a pipefitter for his employer, a DOD contractor, since June 2006. He was granted a security clearance in 2010. (Items 1,3, 4, 5) The SOR alleged that Applicant owed the IRS $15,152 in delinquent federal taxes for tax years (TY) 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that he had a judgment entered against him in 2019 for a $1,150 past-due medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and a university account in collection for $336 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant disclosed and discussed his delinquent federal taxes and delinquent debts on his 2020 security clearance application (SCA), during his June 2020 background interview, and in his April 2021 response to interrogatories.

The case was assigned to \nme on March 17, 2022. The Government\u2019s documents identified as Items 1 through 8 in \nthe FORM are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 38 years old. \nHe was married and he has two children--one adult and one minor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2002. He attended college from 2002 to 2003, in 2010, and in 2014, but \nhe did not earn a degree. He obtained a certificate in heating, ventilation, and air \nconditioning in 2020. As of his April 2020 SCA, he worked as a pipefitter for his \nemployer, a DOD contractor, since June 2006. He was granted a security clearance in \n2010. (Items 1,3, 4, 5) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed the IRS $15,152 in delinquent federal \ntaxes for tax years (TY) 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleged that he had a judgment entered against him in 2019 for a $1,150 past-due \nmedical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and a university account in collection for $336 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In \naddition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant disclosed and discussed his \ndelinquent federal taxes and delinquent debts on his 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA), during his June 2020 background interview, and in his April 2021 \nresponse to interrogatories. Court records also report the liens entered against \nApplicant by the IRS. Court records and the February 2021 credit bureau report also \nreport SOR debt \u00b6 1.c. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent federal taxes to a lack of income, his spouse\u2019s \none-year period of unemployment from 2014 to 2015, and because \u201cI had a lot going on \nwith helping my family.\u201d He stated in his SCA that he hired a tax relief program to assist \nhim with resolving his delinquent federal taxes, but \u201call they did was take over 3,000 \ndollars from me.\u201d He also stated that he was working with another tax company to assist \nhim with resolving his delinquent federal taxes. He stated that this tax company \ncontacted the IRS on his behalf, guided him to change his tax withholdings to zero to \nallow for more taxes to be taken out of his paycheck, and assisted him with setting up a \npayment plan to resolve his delinquent federal taxes. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5). \nCourt records reflect that the IRS entered liens against Applicant in the amounts \nof $29,675, $671, and $9,176, in July 2014, September 2019, and June 2021, \nrespectively. April 2021 IRS tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant owed past-due \nfederal taxes in the amounts of $2,077, $2,597, $1,029, $2,688, $5,702, and $1,056, for \na total of $15,149, for TY 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The transcripts \nreflect that he did not have any outstanding federal taxes for TY 2012, 2015, and 2019. \nThe transcripts reflect that the IRS applied credits of $80, $3,701, and $4,453 in 2014, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2016, and 2020, respectively, to his outstanding taxes for TY 2011, and Applicant had \nnot made any payments toward his outstanding taxes. Applicant contacted the IRS in \nMay and June 2021 to set up a payment arrangement to resolve his outstanding taxes. \nHe stated that he entered into a payment arrangement of $106 monthly beginning in \nJune 2021. As of December 2021, he was still trying to reach a payment arrangement \nwith the IRS to resolve his outstanding taxes. He made four payments to the IRS, from \nJune to September 2021, of $110, $110, $100, and $50. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A) \nApplicant stated that he entered into a payment arrangement of $57 monthly, \nbetween June 2021 and July 2023, to resolve the medical judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.b. As of \nDecember 2021, he stated that he made an initial payment of $228, and he would make \nsubsequent payments of $50, for a total of $836, to resolve this debt. Applicant paid the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Items 3, 5, 7; AE A) \nApplicant described his financial status as \u201cimproving\u201d during his background \ninterview. He traveled to the Bahamas for tourism in 2014 and 2017, and to Mexico in \n2018. A personal financial statement that he completed in April 2021 reflected that he \nhad a monthly net remainder of $147, not accounting for any payments toward the IRS. \n(Items 4, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required\u201d apply. Applicant was unable to pay his debts and he owes \napproximately $15,152 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, \nand 2018. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and, \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nand I find SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant paid only $480 toward his outstanding federal taxes between June \nand September 2021. Although he stated that he was working with a tax company to \nresolve his outstanding federal taxes, he did not provide documentation to corroborate \nhis claim and he was still trying to reach a payment arrangement with the IRS as of \nDecember 2021. In addition, while he stated that he made an initial payment of $228 to \nresolve SOR \u00b6 1.b, he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. There is \nno evidence that he has received financial counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(g) are not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ __ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree. Since December 2018, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 2.) The SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from April 2011 to at least March 2021, and intends to use marijuana in the future; (2) used LSD in March 2019; (3) used cocaine in February 2018; and (4) misused Adderall in October 2017. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 1.) Applicant later qualified those admissions. He understands that his use of marijuana is problematic for his security clearance. He purchases marijuana from an outside, illegal source. He intends to continue using marijuana in his own home, because it reduces stress and improves his sleep and appetite. Applicant is concerned about the side effects of prescription drugs that could provide those same benefits.

The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, effective \nwithin the DOD as of June 8, 2017. \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on June 21, 2021, and June 25, 2021, \nand elected a decision on the written record by an administrative judge of the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On October 28, 2021, Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Item 1 through 3. (Items.)

The case was \nassigned to me on January 25, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Applicant has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. Since December 2018, he has been employed by a defense \ncontractor. (Item 2.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) used marijuana with varying frequency from \nApril 2011 to at least March 2021, and intends to use marijuana in the future; (2) used \nLSD in March 2019; (3) used cocaine in February 2018; and (4) misused Adderall in \nOctober 2017. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. (Item 1.) \nApplicant later qualified those admissions. He understands that his use of \nmarijuana is problematic for his security clearance. He purchases marijuana from an \noutside, illegal source. He intends to continue using marijuana in his own home, \nbecause it reduces stress and improves his sleep and appetite. Applicant is concerned \nabout the side effects of prescription drugs that could provide those same benefits. He \nused cocaine, Adderall, and LSD each only once and has no intention to use those \ndrugs in the future. Applicant used Adderall, which had been prescribed for one of his \nfriends. He used cocaine that was provided by an acquaintance of one of Applicant\u2019s \nfriends. The LSD was provided by an unnamed acquaintance. (Items 2 and 3.) \nDiscussion \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline (AG) H, suitability of an applicant may be questioned \nor put into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about \na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, \nand 26 set forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance; and \n expressed intent to continue drug involvement . . . \n  AG \u00b6 25(g)\nApplicant admitted to illegally procuring and using marijuana from April 2011, to \nMarch 2021.

In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml. \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nLSD and cocaine are Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances, \nrespectively, under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq.

If the \nFederal law is supposed to reflect the will of the majority of the people, 40 \nof the 50 states is an overwhelming majority and the federal law simply has \nnot kept up. \nMy use of medical marijuana does not result in being impaired and does not \nadversely affect my judgment. To the contrary, I believe I have an \nestablished record of doing the right thing and this is reflected in the four \ncharacter reference letters attached to this correspondence. Additionally, \nwhile maintaining a clearance was a requirement for my position . . . , the \nrequirement has been waived for me [by my employer]. I believe this is in \nlarge part because I have been forthcoming and transparent from the very \nbeginning - when I believed my job was on the line \u2013 again keeping with my \ntrack record of doing the right thing. \nIn conclusion, I can see no evidence of my conduct that casts doubt on my \nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgement. Additionally, although my job \nis not in jeopardy as a result of the outcome of this hearing, my not having \na clearance would be a roadblock that would require significant workaround \nand undoubtedly delay the time it will take to [accomplish his employer\u2019s \nobjectives]. With this in mind, it is obvious that allowing me to keep my \nsecurity clearance is clearly consistent with the interest of national security. \n(AE E) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCharacter Evidence \nFour friends and coworkers who have known Applicant for several years praised \nhis good character and contributions to the national defense. (AE A-AE D) The general \nsense of their statements is that he is an exceptionally intelligent, diligent, skilled, \ntalented, driven, trustworthy, and professional employee. He has an important patent; \nhowever, his current employer is not involved in using the patent. (AE F) His character \nevidence provides important support for his access to classified information. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access \nto classified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d; and \u201c(g) express intent to continue \ndrug involvement and substance misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). \nAG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. Applicant held an interim security clearance; however, \nhe did not actually have access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) (comparing holding a security clearance with actual access to \nclassified information in the context of AG \u00b6 25(f)). There is no definition in the Directive \ndefining a sensitive position, and the evidence did not establish Applicant\u2019s position was \nsensitive at the time he was possessing and using marijuana. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th\nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The\nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana possession and \nuse during the security clearance process. He has a state medical marijuana card, and \nhis marijuana possession and use does not violate state law. His character evidence \nclearly supports his access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. Applicant used \nmarijuana on a daily basis after completion of his SCA, OPM personal subject interview, \nand receipt of the SOR. He intends to continue using marijuana. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a \nhistory of marijuana use, had completed an SCA, but did not have an approved security \nclearance. The Appeal Board reversed the grant of a security clearance and said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Guideline \nH security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old senior research scientist and technical lead for a highly \ntechnical facility. A DOD contractor has employed him for about 30 months (since October \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n2019). In 1991, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in mechanical engineering, \nand in 1998, he received a master of science degree. \nFour friends and coworkers praised his good character and contributions to the \nnational defense. The general sense of their statements is that he is an exceptionally \nintelligent, diligent, skilled, talented, driven, trustworthy, and professional employee. He \nhas an important patent. The character evidence provides important support for his \naccess to classified information. \nApplicant disclosed his history of involvement with marijuana on his SCA, during \nhis OPM personal subject interview, in his SOR response, and at his hearing. He did not \ntest positive on a urinalysis test, and he does not have any drug-related arrests. An honest \nand candid self-report of marijuana use is an important indication that, if granted security \nclearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if \nthe disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal \nreputation. \nThe evidence against grant or continuation of a security clearance is more \npersuasive at this time. Applicant used marijuana after he received the SOR on a daily \nbasis up to and including the day of his hearing. He said he intends to continue to use \nmarijuana. He used marijuana to treat a serious medical condition. He has a state medical \nmarijuana card which authorizes his marijuana possession and use under state law. His \nmarijuana possession and use while holding an interim security clearance, but not while \nbeing granted access to classified information, showed poor judgment in the context of \nsecurity rules. His marijuana possession and/or use violated federal law and security \npolicies. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

In the Answer, he admitted all of the \nSOR allegations with additional comment and attached documents. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact, and his attached documents are made part of the record. \nThe SOR allegations are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. (Answer; GE 1-6) \nApplicant claimed his financial issues resulted from a period of marital problems \nand an unforeseen federal tax burden from the 2016 tax year. He claimed that, in 2017, \nwhen he completed the forms for his 2016 federal income tax return, he realized that he \nowed the IRS about $6,600 for that tax year. He could not afford to pay that income tax \nbill, so he \u201cshut down.\u201d He did not timely file or pay his 2016 federal income taxes.1 In \nAugust 2019, he filed his federal 2016 tax return and made payment arrangements with \nthe IRS to satisfy his 2016 federal tax debt. In about 2021, he satisfied his 2016 federal \nincome tax debt through monthly payments and offsets. He has not owed federal \nincome taxes after the 2016 tax year because he and his spouse changed their \nwithholdings in 2017. (Tr. 20, 38-48, 68-69; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant funded his six years of college with federal student loans. In about \nFebruary 2017, the grace period on these student loans expired, requiring him to make \npayments. However, as a result of his marital problems and shutting down from his \nunforeseen income tax debt, he failed to make the required payments. In January 2019, \nhe received a notice of default that informed him that he must make payments of about \n$800 per month on his student loans or his wages would be garnished. He did not \nvoluntarily make the required payments, so his wages were garnished in the amount of \nabout $200-$214 per pay period from January 2019 until March 2020. The wage \ngarnishment ended when President Biden automatically deferred all federal student \nloan payments because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant\u2019s student loans are in \ndeferment until the COVID-19 automatic deferral ends. However, his student loans were \nin default prior to this deferment period. He did not tell his spouse about his student loan \ndefault until August 2019. (Tr. 20-21, 37-38, 44, 49-52, 63-64, 67-69; Answer; GE 1-6) \nApplicant claimed that he contacted his student loan servicer after the COVID-19 \ndeferment period began.

The only documentary evidence he \nprovided of his contact with his loan servicer is a June 2021 letter from his loan servicer \nconfirming the balance on his student loans and to whom he should make payments. \nApplicant claimed that once the COVID-19 deferral ends he will have to make several \nmonthly payments of $1,000, and then his student loans will be rehabilitated. He \nclaimed that once his loans are rehabilitated, his new monthly payment will be about \n$1,000. He provided no documents to corroborate his rehabilitation period or his new \nmonthly payment amount. He intends to make those rehabilitation payments when they \nbecome due and then resume his normal monthly payments.

In 2020, he made about \n$70,000 annually. His spouse shares household income and expenses. She makes \nabout $100,000 annually. However, her income is commission-based, so it fluctuates. \nApplicant claimed that he has $20,000 in a savings account and $1,000 in a checking \naccount. He claimed that he has money in a retirement account, but he does not know \nhow much. He pays $1,300 per month towards his mortgage, but that payment will \nincrease to about $1,700 once he completes a refinance of his mortgage in order to \nrenovate his home. Between late 2019 and early 2021, he purchased two used \nvehicles, paying a total of about $7,000 in down payments and borrowing the rest. He \npays a total of about $850 per month on these two car notes. He has not received any \nfinancial counseling and does not follow a written budget. (Tr. 28-34, 60-63, 70) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has multiple delinquent federal student loans. His federal student loans \nbecame delinquent in about 2017. The only payments he made on these student loans \nwere through an involuntary wage garnishment. Although President Biden extended a \npause on the collection of student loans due to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment \nperiod \non \nstudent-loan \npayments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-\nroom/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-federal-student-loan-payments/), \nthat \naction does not excuse previously delinquent student loans. See ISCR Case No. 20-\n01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant simply ignored his financial responsibility with respect to his student \nloans. He provided no evidence that he was unable to address them. His federal \nstudent loan delinquencies resulted from conditions within his control. \nA security clearance represents an obligation to the federal government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \ngovernment has a direct bearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nWhile these debts are in a deferment status because of the pandemic, Applicant had \nalready defaulted on them prior to the deferment. When student loans are placed in a \ndeferment status after they are in default, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in \nthe context of security clearance eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not contact his student loan servicer to resolve his delinquencies \nuntil after the SOR was issued. His testimony regarding the timing of this contact is \nequivocal and does not establish that this effort occurred any earlier. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or \nher clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and \nregulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). His only payments on these student loans \ncame as a result of an involuntary wage garnishment. Court-ordered or otherwise \ninvoluntary means of debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight \nthan actions initiated and carried through by the debtor. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). The timing and nature of his efforts to address these debts \nundermines his ability to show that he acted in good faith or responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nAs evidenced by the money in his savings account, Applicant\u2019s seems to have \nsufficient funds to pay his student loans when they are no longer deferred. However, as \nhe knowingly has not made any voluntary payments since 2017, he has not established \na track record of voluntarily complying with his payment requirements. Therefore, I \ncannot find that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. I find that the security \nconcerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s financial problems continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and honorable discharge.

He received the FORM on March 20, 2022, and was given 30 days after receipt \nof the FORM to raise objections, to submit evidence in extenuation and mitigation, and \nof his efforts to resolve his financial problems. He did not submit an answer to the \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2022. Without objections, I admitted \nand considered the Government\u2019s proposed evidence and Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR. \nProcedural Issues \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included an \nunauthenticated summary of his June 26, 2020, interview with a government \nbackground investigator. (FORM, Item 3) Applicant was informed he could object to the \nsummary of his interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or that he could \nmake corrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make it accurate. \nApplicant was informed that his failure to respond to the FORM or to raise any \nobjections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence would be \nconsidered. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. Without objections, I admitted and \nconsidered all of the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has four accounts in collection against him (\u00b6 1.a, for \n$617; \u00b6 1.c, for $524; \u00b6 1.d, for $1,040; and \u00b6 1.f, for $7,206), and four charged-off \naccounts (\u00b6 1.b, for $312; \u00b6 1.e, for $546; \u00b6 1.g, for $1,957; and \u00b6 1.h, for $12,443), \ntotaling $24,645. \nIn his answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations without \ncomment. I note; however, that he disputed the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, as \nindicated in the June 2020 credit report, but there is no resolution disclosed. (Item 4) \nAlso, according to the July 2021 credit report (Item 5), he owes only $6,255 for the \naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. His admissions are hereby incorporated into my findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is a 28-year-old high school graduate. He served in the U.S. Navy on \nactive duty between March 2014 and March 2018. He stated he received an honorable \ndischarge after the completion of his service obligation. He attended a technology \ncollege between July 2019 and June 2020, but did not complete the program. He \nmarried in September 2014, and has a three-year-old daughter. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows he was supported by his parents while in \nhigh school. He worked as a delivery driver between May and July 2013, and was \nunemployed between July 2013 and March 2014.

In his responses to questions in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 \nSCA, Applicant disclosed having no financial problems, such as delinquent, in \ncollection, or charged-off financial accounts. The subsequent background investigation \nrevealed the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on June 26, 2020. (Item 3) He \nwas confronted with a number of delinquent financial accounts he failed to disclose in \nhis 2020 SCA. He told the investigator that he did not disclose the accounts because he \nwas not aware he was required to list accounts he had paid, was paying, or was in the \nprocess of settling. He also indicated he was unaware of some of the accounts, or that \nsome accounts were delinquent or charged off. Applicant stated he had retained the \nservices of the Lexington Law Firm to help him resolve some of his delinquent accounts. \nThe investigator asked Applicant to submit documentary evidence to corroborate \nhis contract with the Lexington Law Firm, to document the accounts included in the \ncontract, and about the status of the other delinquent accounts in the credit report. \nFollowing his interview, Applicant failed to submit any documentary evidence to \ncorroborate his claims about retaining a company to help him. He did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence with his response to the SOR, and he failed to respond to the \nFORM. \nAll of the SOR allegations are established by the documents in evidence, \nincluding Applicant\u2019s SOR admission, his statement to an OPM investigator during his \n2020 interview, and the credit reports in evidence. (FORM, Items 1, 3, 4, and 5) \nApplicant failed to submit sufficient documentary evidence about his efforts to \ncontact his creditors, of any payment agreements established, of any payments made to \nthe creditors alleged in the SOR, or of having retained the services of a debt resolution \ncompany to assist him with his financial problems. The accounts alleged in the SOR are \noutstanding and unresolved. He presented no evidence to show he has participated in \nfinancial counseling or has a working budget. He did not present evidence of his and his \nspouse\u2019s current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly \nexpenses, and monthly net remainder). Without any documentary evidence of his \ncurrent financial situation, it is not possible for me to assess whether he is financially \noverextended. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a \ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing \naccess to classified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense consideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. \nA \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. As alleged in the \nSOR, he has three accounts in collection against him (\u00b6 1.a, for $617; \u00b6 1.c, for $524; \nand \u00b6 1.f, for $6,255), and four charged-off accounts (\u00b6 1.b, for $312; \u00b6 1.e, for $546; \u00b6 \n1.g, for $1,957; and \u00b6 1.h, for $12,443), totaling over $23,000. He disputed the account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,040), as indicated in the June 2020 credit report. Although he \npresented no evidence to show the account was resolved in his favor, I gave him credit \nfor attempting to resolve the account. As noted above, Applicant presented no \ndocumentary evidence of any good-faith efforts on his part to pay, settle, or resolve his \ndelinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant was unemployed for about a year before he enlisted in the Navy in \n2014. After his 2018 discharge, he was unemployed between March 2018 and October \n2019. He was hired by a federal contractor in October 2019, and presumably, he has \nbeen consistently employed to present. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems could be attributed to \nhis periods of \nunemployment, his military discharge, the expenses associated with the birth of his \ndaughter, and underemployment conditions for him or his wife. Notwithstanding, he \nfailed to submit documentary evidence to corroborate his efforts to contact his creditors, \nof any payment agreements established, of any payments made, or of having retained \nthe services of a debt resolution company to assist him with his financial problems. He \npresented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling. He did not \npresent evidence of his and his spouse\u2019s current financial situation (gross monthly \nincome, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). Without any \ndocumentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not possible for me to \nassess whether or not he is financially overextended. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to show he has been financially responsible \nunder his circumstances.

They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. \nIn this instance, the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial responsibility, and that his financial problems are being resolved and are under \ncontrol. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the future, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. In this case, Applicant failed to submit sufficient documentary \nevidence of his efforts to resolve his financial problems. Additionally, he presented no \nevidence to show he has participated in financial counseling. He also did not present \nevidence of his current financial situation (gross monthly income, deductions, monthly \nexpenses, and monthly net remainder). The financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 28, has been working for his employer, a federal contractor since June \n2020, whom has sponsored him for a clearance. His evidence is insufficient to establish \nthat he has been financially responsible. He failed to establish he has taken good-faith \nefforts to resolve his financial problems. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Since Applicant did not respond to the FORM, he did not submit any evidence \nafter submitting the answer to the SOR, nor did he offer any objection to Item 3, which is \ntherefore admitted. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, with a brief narrative \nstatement.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 69 years old. He and his second wife have been married since 1994. \nHe has two children from his first marriage, and three stepchildren, all now adults. (Item \n3) Applicant has worked as a subject matter expert for a large defense contractor since \nSeptember 2020. (Item 3 at 13) Previously, from August 2002 to September 2020, he \nwas the president of a computer company that provided consulting services to the U.S. \nNavy and the U.S. Coast Guard. (Item 3 at 14) Applicant lived and worked in State 1 \nfrom 2002 to 2018. Since January 2019, he has lived and worked in State 2. (Item 3 at \n9-10) \nItem 3, Applicant\u2019s 2020 SCA, is the only exhibit in the record. When asked on \nhis SCA if he had ever held a clearance before, Applicant reported that he either had a \nbackground investigation or been granted a security clearance by the Coast Guard. \nWhen asked the level of his access granted, he checked \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d (Item 3 at 41) \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA that he has used medical cannabis daily to \nrelieve severe head pain since September 2018. He indicated that it was legally \nprescribed in State 1, where he used to live. He said \u201cI still need this for pain relief.\u201d \n(Item 3 at 39) Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question asking about illegal drug use \nwhile possessing a security clearance. (Item 3 at 39) It is presumed that Applicant had a \nbackground interview during the security clearance application process, as is \ncustomary, but the summary of that interview, which might provide additional details, is \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot in the record. It therefore does not to appear that Applicant has ever held a \nclearance before, or holds one currently, as the Government would have noted if it were \nso. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b concern Applicant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana and his \nstated intentions to continue using marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted both \nallegations. In his Answer to the SOR, he said his marijuana is prescribed for a severely \npainful and chronic neurological condition. He said there is another prescription \navailable for this condition, but it is contraindicated for him, since he takes another \nprescription for a heart condition. (Item 2) This is undocumented. \nApplicant said \u201ceven on bad days I limit my use [of medical marijuana] to the \nevening to help me sleep. On \u201clight days (only one or two attacks,)\u201d he said that CBD \n(cannabidiol) \u201ccan give me sufficient relief and [I] have started to phase out the use of \nmarijuana when possible.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant provided no further information in his SOR response. He gave no \nupdated information about the frequency of his use of medical marijuana or CBD. He \ndid not document his medical diagnosis, his need for medicinal marijuana or a \nprescription for it, nor did he assert its purported legality, under state law, either in State \n1, where he used to live, or State 2, where he lives now. (Item 2) Applicant did not \nrespond to the Government\u2019s FORM. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and  \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited\ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the\nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state\nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). The current National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, 2017, after 2014 DNI memo was\nissued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (citing Guideline H, alleged in this case, \nand the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines E and J, not alleged \nhere). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not determinative, to \nadjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a \nsensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nApplicant disclosed on his September 2020 SCA that he has used medical \nmarijuana on a daily basis as pain relief due to a chronic condition. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 25(f) is not established, as there is no evidence that Applicant used marijuana \nwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that he has continued to use \nmarijuana and CBD to alleviate the chronic pain from his condition. He also failed \u201cto \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue\u201d his medical marijuana use, so AG \u00b6 \n25(g) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and  \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs the 2021 DNI memo notes, relevant mitigating factors under the AGs include, \nbut are not limited to, \nfrequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate that future \nuse is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or other such \nappropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing federal law \nand policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position \nor holding a security clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise \nprospective national security workforce employees that they should refrain \nfrom any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security \nvetting process, which commences once the individual signs the \ncertification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is frequent, recent and likely ongoing, and he stated \nan intention to continue using marijuana as pain relief for his chronic medical condition. \nIt is not established that Applicant\u2019s use of medical marijuana is legal under his state \nlaw (particularly in State 2, where he now lives, as Department Counsel points out) \n(FORM at 3). Even if so, legality of Applicant\u2019s conduct under state law is not mitigating \nwhere his use of marijuana, a Schedule 1 controlled substance, continues to violate \nFederal law. As such, Applicant\u2019s pattern and use of medical marijuana continues to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to \nhis eligibility for a DOD security clearance. He has also continued to use marijuana after \nsubmitting his SCA, and gave no indication after receiving either the SOR or the FORM \nthat he intends to cease doing so. He has neither established a pattern of abstinence or \nchanged circumstances, nor has he clearly stated an intent to abstain from marijuana \nuse in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) do not apply.  \nAG \u00b6 25(c) also does not apply. It is chiefly geared towards applicants with \nevidence of prescription drug abuse. It is not established that Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana is, in fact, pursuant to a prescription, since that is undocumented. Even if so, \nApplicant also continues to use marijuana, and has given no indication that his use has \nended. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nIn this case, Applicant offered little whole-person evidence to consider. The only \nexhibit is his SCA, and the only statement he offered is in his answer to the SOR. He \ndid not request a hearing nor did he respond to the FORM, opportunities where he \nmight have offered additional evidence, either in mitigation or at least explanation, either \nunder Guideline H or under the whole-person concept. \nApplicant seeks a security clearance with the U.S. Department of Defense, and \nmarijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under Federal law. Even though \nhis marijuana use, for purely medical purposes, may be legal under the law of State 1, \nwhere he used to live, or State 2 where he lives now (neither of which he established) \nhe has a recent history and pattern of disregarding Federal law in using marijuana, even \nfor medical purposes. \nEven though Applicant has a sympathetic case, I therefore cannot find that \nApplicant has met his burden of showing that he has fully mitigated the security \nconcerns set forth by his pattern of recent, frequent, even daily use of marijuana for \nmedical purposes and his intention to continue such use in the future. I conclude \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns about his \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for holding a public trust \nposition is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 28, 2021, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 14, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on May 4, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for June 23, \n2022, and was heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of five exhibits. (GEs 1-5) Applicant relied on six exhibits (AEs A-F) and one \nwitness (herself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 6, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the opening of the hearing, on June 2, 2022, the Government amended \nthe SOR to strike (1) \u201cApplicant for a security clearance and replace it with the caption \n\u201cApplicant for a Public trust Position\u201d; (2) ISCR and replace it with ADP\u201d; and (3) the \nopening paragraph and replace it with \u201cA review of your eligibility to occupy an \nautomated data processing (ADP) position designated ADP-I/II/III to support a \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) contract has been made pursuant to DoD Directive 5220-\n6, dated January 2, 1992, (as amended). Because this office is unable to conclude that \nyou are eligible to occupy such a position, your case will be submitted to an \nAdministrative Judge for a determination as to whether or not to grant, deny, or revoke \nyour eligibility. This determination is based on the following reasons (incorporating \nallegations of the SOR). The government made these amendments after confirmation \nfrom Applicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer (FSO) that Applicant requires a public trust \ndesignation, rather than a secret security clearance. The Government reaffirmed that \nthe designation changes do not alter the substance of the SOR.  \nBefore the close of the hearing, the parties requested the record be kept open to \npermit the Government and Applicant to submit additional documentation. For good \ncause shown, the Government was granted 14 calendar days to supplement the record \nwith a copy of Applicant\u2019s May 2019 bankruptcy petition. Applicant was afforded seven \ndays to respond. Within the time permitted, the Government submitted two additional \nexhibits (a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition filed in May 2019 and a bankruptcy docket \nsummary) that were admitted without objection as GEs 6-7. Additional briefing \nsubmissions were posted by the parties on the issue of the Appeal Board\u2019s past \ntreatment of tax-filings and installment agreements completed after the filing of SORs. \nWithin the time permitted, both parties responded with briefing statements. (HEs 1-3) \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in \nOctober 2019, which was dismissed in March 2021; (b) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nrelief in May 2019, which was discharged in August 2019; and (c) is indebted to the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for delinquent taxes in the estimated amount of $17,695 \nfor at least tax years 2013 through 2018. Allegedly, these tax debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted her bankruptcy filings and \ndispositions with explanations and clarifications. She claimed she filed for Chapter 13 \nrelief in October 2019 to save her home from a foreclosure sale, relying on the advice of \nher father.

She claimed \nthat all of her tax returns for the stated years through 2017 were filed late with the help \nof a tax professional with expertise in expat tax filing. She further claimed her 2018 \nfederal tax returns were timely filed and accepted by the IRS. She claimed, too, to have \nobtained a filing extension for tax year 2019 and timely filed her 2019 federal tax returns \nin August 2021. She claimed she did so with the hope that an installment agreement \nwith the IRS could be established and payments initiated. And, she claimed to have \nalready initiated payments under her June 2021 installment agreement with the IRS. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a DoD contractor who seeks eligibility to \nhold a public trust position.

(Tr. 48)  \nWhile employed abroad (2011-2017), Applicant regularly filed for extensions for \nthose tax years. (Tr. 49-54) Once she returned to the United States in 2017, she \nretained a tax professional with expertise in tax filing for overseas clients. She retained \nthis tax professional specifically to help her with filing her federal tax returns for the \n2013-2017 tax years, which she did in late 2017. (HEs 1-3; Tr. 49-53) For these \ncombined tax years, she accrued estimated tax deficiencies totaling $17,695 for the \ncombined years.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an \nevaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal \nis a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information, or to hold a public trust position. These guidelines include \nconditions that could raise a trust concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying \nconditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could mitigate trust concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not eligibility to access \nclassified information or hold a public trust position should be granted, continued, or \ndenied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable trust risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                    Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her a\n dmitted bankruptcy filings and dispositions, and her accumulation of \nowed federal taxes to the IRS, are fully documented and create judgment issues as well \nover the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. \n24, 2004). Although she qualified her admissions with explanations, her admissions can \nbe weighed along with other evidence developed during the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and privacy information \nis required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance \nor public trust position that entitles the person to access classified or privacy-protected \ninformation. While the principal concern of a security clearance or public trust holder\u2019s \ndemonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment \nand trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax and other debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information, or to holding a public trust position. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. \nAug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited financial difficulties associated with her bankruptcy filings and \naccrued back federal taxes owed are accompanied by considerable extenuating \ncircumstances. Considered together contextually, these circumstances enable her to \ntake advantage of several of the potentially available extenuating and mitigating \nbenefits. Application of mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d fully applies to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. Applicable mitigating conditions include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated \nand is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise debts\u201d and \n20(g), \u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d \nWhile partial credit is warranted for the recent on-line steps Applicant took to \neducate herself on financial, money, and borrowing losses, it is still too early to fully \nevaluate the counseling benefits she gained from these courses. Accordingly, MC \u00b6 \n20(c), \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being received or is under control,\u201d \nhas limited application to Applicant\u2019s situation. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, she entered into installment agreements with the IRS in \n2021 and is current with her obligated monthly payments. Her collective efforts provide \npersuasive proof of her voluntary efforts to resolve these debts.  \nThe Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to \nprovide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, \nwhether the issues relate to back taxes owed, consumer, medical, or other debts and \naccounts (inclusive of mortgages). See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. \n18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, her installment agreements were not consummated until \nafter the issuance of the SOR in May 2021, her agreements were preceded by months \nof communications initiated by Applicant and her tax professional with the IRS following \nher return to the United States in 2017. As such, her 2021 installment agreements \n(while post-dating the SOR) do not reflect poor judgment or disregard of IRS tax filing \nand payment responsibilities in addressing her tax obligations. Compare ISCR Case \nNo. 14-06808 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. \nJune 29, 2016); and ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5-6 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s public trust eligibility requires \nconsideration of whether her finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a public trust position. Applicant is entitled to credit for not only her work in \nsupporting DoD defense efforts for a number of years in a Middle East country (2011-\n2017 and 2021), but also for the trust she has inspired from friends who know and trust \nher, and most importantly, for the proactive initiatives she has mounted to address her \nmortgage and tax debts and restore her finances to stable levels.  \nOverall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this case, it \nis safe to make predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake reasoned, good-faith \nefforts to maintain her finances in stable order within the foreseeable future. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns are mitigated. Eligibility `to hold a public trust position is \ngranted.    \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n                              \n \n \n                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nGuideline F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for holding a \npublic trust position.

Applicant is 44 years old. He married in 2000 and divorced in October 2018. He has two children from the marriage, ages 16 and 12. He was employed from 2001 to 2018. He was unemployed from November 2018 until July 2019. He worked for two different employers until he was hired by his present employer in April 2020. (Item 3) Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2010 and had their debts discharged in 2015. He and his wife had considerable consumer debt and judgments discharged. (Item 2) Since the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has accumulated numerous delinquent debts that are alleged in the SOR. A couple became delinquent in 2018, but most happened in 2020. He disputed three judgments that were alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-$4,991; 1.c-$1,959; and 1.d- $7,145). It appears these are included in his bankruptcy discharge and do not appear on his October 2020 credit report. These allegations are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 7, 2021, and elected to have his case decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government had no objections. All \nevidence was admitted. The case was assigned to me on November 4, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e through 1.l, and 1.p. He \ndenied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d, and 1.m through 1.o. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He married in 2000 and divorced in October 2018. He \nhas two children from the marriage, ages 16 and 12. He was employed from 2001 to \n2018. He was unemployed from November 2018 until July 2019. He worked for two \ndifferent employers until he was hired by his present employer in April 2020. (Item 3) \nApplicant and his wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2010 and had their debts \ndischarged in 2015. He and his wife had considerable consumer debt and judgments \ndischarged. (Item 2) \nSince the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has accumulated numerous delinquent \ndebts that are alleged in the SOR. A couple became delinquent in 2018, but most \nhappened in 2020. He disputed three judgments that were alleged (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-$4,991; \n1.c-$1,959; and 1.d- $7,145). It appears these are included in his bankruptcy discharge \nand do not appear on his October 2020 credit report. These allegations are resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. His bankruptcy was not alleged in the SOR. Any derogatory information \nthat was not alleged will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be \nconsidered, in the application of mitigating conditions, and when making a whole-person \nanalysis. \nApplicant attributed his current financial difficulties to his divorce and period of \nunemployment. In his June 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his \nchild support was in arrears (approximately $10,500) due to his unemployment. He noted \nhe was making timely payments and additional payments each month to apply to the \narrearage. SOR \u00b6 1.e reflects the amount in arrears is $11,137. He did not disclose any \nother financial delinquencies. (Items 2, 3) \nIn his FORM response, Applicant provided a copy of his current child support \npayment record. It reflects he is making regular payments and additional payments to \nreduce the arrearage. As of July 2021 the arrearage balance is $6,803. Applicant is \nresolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e.

For each delinquent debt alleged in the SOR, he explained that he could \nnot recall when the account was opened. He stated the accounts were held jointly with \nhis wife, and she was responsible for paying the debt, but agreed he would pay it and will \nhave it removed from his credit report. He intended to work with his ex-wife to get the \ndebts paid. He anticipated paying the delinquent accounts by November 2025. (Item 4) \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that this debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($26,346), \nwas for an involuntary car repossession and there was likely a delinquent balance owed. \nApplicant\u2019s October 2020 credit report shows that the vehicle was repossessed and a \npossible balance was due. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated his ex-wife was \npaying this loan and he provided the page from his credit report showing that the current \nbalance owed is $15,569 as of June 2021, and that the account was closed in December \n2018. It is likely the creditor agreed to return the vehicle to Applicant\u2019s wife, permit her to \nbring the payments current and allow her to make monthly payments. I find in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor on this allegation. (Item 2 at page 61; Item 5) \nApplicant stated that he is unable at this time to pay the charged-off debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($1,844), 1.i ($1,046), and 1.p ($1,346), but intends to in the future. These \ndebts are unresolved. (Items 2, 5) \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he was making payments of $200 \non the collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and had reduced the balance to $2,700. \nHe did not provide documents to substantiate his statement. The debt is unresolved. \n(Items 2, 5) \nApplicant provided a document to show that in October 2021, he made a payment \nagreement with the creditor for the collection account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,571). He \nwill pay $77 a month until May 2022 to resolve the debt. This debt is being resolved. (AE \nE) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he made a copy of the SOR and scribbled \nnotations next to some of the allegations. His notations do not substantiate that he has \nmade payments to resolve the charged-off store card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j \n($1,045). This debt is not resolved. (AE B) \nApplicant provided a July 2021 payment agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.k \n($1,013) to pay $50 a month.

There is no evidence he has recently attended any type of financial counseling. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in \napproximately 2018 and continued to 2020 when many were charged off because of his \nnonpayment. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to a divorce in 2018 combined with a \nperiod of unemployment. These were conditions beyond his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant provided evidence that he has resolved some debts, made \nsome payments towards others, but also has debts that he cannot pay at this time. \nApplicant and his wife had a substantial amount of delinquent debt discharged in \nbankruptcy in 2015. They again accumulated numerous delinquent debts. It appears he \nwas overextended financially, which was then exacerbated when he went through a \ndivorce and was unemployed. He is again digging himself out of debt, and is paying some \nof his creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling. He did not \nprovide evidence regarding his current finances. Applicant has paid some of his \ndelinquent debts, but at this juncture, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that his \nfinancial issues are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has made payments and resolved some delinquent debts as noted in the \nfindings of fact. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those debts. The fact that the three judgments \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d were resolved through bankruptcy and Applicant is no \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlonger legally responsible for them, does not equate to a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s financial history, insufficient evidence about his current \nfinances, and unreliable past financial record, I am not convinced that future financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. After having his debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2015, \nApplicant again accumulated numerous delinquent debts. I have considered his divorce \nand unemployment, but it is too soon to conclude that Applicant has a firm grasp on \npreventing future financial problems or has established a reliable financial track record. \nHis recurring financial issues cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Despite some mitigation, it is insufficient to \novercome the security concerns raised. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph:  1.o:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph:  1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) \nApplicant cancelled his repayment agreement with DRC in April 2020. He stated \nin May 2020 that he intended to repay his creditors. Based on his May 2021 SOR \nresponse, he admitted each debt but he is now disputing all seven of these accounts. He \ndid not provide an explanation or a legitimate basis for each of the disputes. He did not \nreply or submit documentation in response to the Government\u2019s FORM within the 30-day \ntime period. There is no evidence to show that he paid, is currently in an arrangement to \npay, or that he successfully and legitimately disputed each delinquent credit-card account. \nAs such, all of the SOR debts, cited above, are unresolved. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt totaling $25,090, and the credit \nreports in evidence establish the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) an inability to satisfy debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nApplicant did not adequately explain why he was unable to make the minimum \npayments on his credit-card accounts or if there were any circumstances beyond his \ncontrol that adversely affected his finances. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve all financial issues or make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and good-faith efforts to pay delinquent debts, \nor resolution of such issues, one at a time, is sufficient. An applicant\u2019s mere promises to \npay debts in the future, without further confirmed action, are inadequate. There is \ninsufficient assurance or supporting documentation in the record that his financial \nproblems are under control and will not recur in the future. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. He failed \nto show that he has paid, is currently paying, successfully disputing, or working with his \ncreditors to establish a payment plan. He did not provide supporting documentation to \ndemonstrate his good-faith efforts to remedy his financial problems. There is insufficient \ninformation to determine the current status of his delinquent debts and if he is able to \nmeet future financial obligations. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career as a government contractor and the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not provide an explanation or documentation about why he was \nunable to provide documented efforts resolving any of the delinquent SOR debts. I \nconclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \n6 \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

In her answer to the SOR, \nshe said she accrued most of her financial obligations during her time in the military when \nshe was not financially responsible.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred several financial obligations during her time in the Navy, debts \nthat subsequently became delinquent, including an auto loan account and four phone \naccounts. The debts are all established by the record evidence, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and continue to cast doubt on her judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. Her personal financial statement suggests that she has \nfunds available to address her debts but she has not done so. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant was unemployed for a period of time after she left the Navy and fell \nbehind on her finances during that period. However, she was discharged from the Navy \nfollowing her own misconduct, which undercuts a finding that her resulting unemployment \nwas due to circumstances beyond her control. She also acknowledged that she was \nfinancially irresponsible while in the Navy, including co-signing on an auto loan without \nunderstanding the responsibility it entailed. She also did not establish that she has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances to address her debts, particularly after she became \ngainfully employed. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Similarly, she has not provided sufficient \nevidence to establish that she has made any payments towards any of her SOR debts, \nor that she has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve her debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply. \nApplicant did not show that she has retained any legitimate and reputable credit \ncounselor to help repay her debts and learn how to manage her finances. The credit \nmonitoring service she retained does not meet that definition. She also did not establish \nthat her debts are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nSimilarly, although Applicant disputed her accounts with letters to credit bureau \nagencies, she did not establish with appropriate documentation that any of her disputes \nare valid and that she is not responsible for the debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcern shown by her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He voluntarily left his job of 15 years in 2005. He went on to work for two other employers between 2005 and 2008. In July 2008, he voluntarily left his job before obtaining new employment, because he did not think that his employer\u2019s time-card practices were ethical. He was not able to find full-time employment again until June 2010. He pulled money from his retirement accounts to pay some of his expenses, but fell behind on his bills, including his mortgage, and his home went into foreclosure.

He was \nworking long hours after September 11, 2001, and was exhausted after four years of hard \nwork. He voluntarily left his job of 15 years in 2005. He went on to work for two other \nemployers between 2005 and 2008. In July 2008, he voluntarily left his job before \nobtaining new employment, because he did not think that his employer\u2019s time-card \npractices were ethical. He was not able to find full-time employment again until June 2010. \nHe pulled money from his retirement accounts to pay some of his expenses, but fell \nbehind on his bills, including his mortgage, and his home went into foreclosure. His wife \nwas steadily employed during that period. (Tr. 64-77, 107-110; AE G; GE 1) \nApplicant has been earning about $150,000 or more a year since 2015. His most \nrecent salary was about $175,000 yearly when he became unemployed in May 2022. His \nwife is earning about $110,000 yearly. His budget while employed shows that Applicant \nand his wife had about $24,000 of gross monthly income, and about $6,800 of disposable \nincome a month. The budget also shows about $500,000 in retirement accounts. He \nstated that after losing his paycheck in May, he has been using his inheritance from his \nparents to pay some of his expenses. (Tr. 64-77, 107-110, 123; AE H) \nApplicant testified that money does not mean much to him. He admitted that he \ndid not take his finances seriously, or keep track of his financial assets and accounts. He \nand his wife have been living beyond their means. While he claims that he does not have \nthe means to resolve his debts, he also stated that he could find lucrative employment \nworking for a private corporation, but does not want to work for them. He stated that if \ndoes not get his clearance, he will not resolve his debts or delinquent taxes, and will just \nlive off his social security.

He claims that the lender did not follow the appropriate \nguidelines, or offer him the payment plan or loan modification that he believes he was \ndue. In about 2011, he hired an attorney who filed a lawsuit against the lender that was \ndismissed, and she filed the four bankruptcy cases on their behalf.

The 2013 case was dismissed for failing to provide information to the \ntrustee, failing to file tax returns, failure to set up a payment schedule for delinquent taxes, \nand excessive monthly personal expenses. In the 2014 case, the debtors moved to \ndismiss on their own. The 2015 case was dismissed for failing to provide information to \nthe trustee. In 2016, the bankruptcy trustee stated that Applicant filed their case in bad \nfaith.

He hired an attorney that he pays $300 monthly to resolve \nhis tax issues and file his returns. He stated that he does not know if his 2019-2021 taxes \nhave been filed yet. He claims that since 2016, his attorney has been trying to get the IRS \nto negotiate a settlement plan to resolve his back taxes, but the IRS does not have the \nmanpower to have the meeting. He claims that they had a meeting scheduled in 2022, \nbut the IRS did not show up. He asserts that most of the back taxes are penalties and \ninterest, which he believes were tacked on to scare him into compliance, and he claims it \nwill all go away once they negotiate a settlement. He admitted that he has not made any \ntax payments for at least ten years, and does not send payments with his returns. He \nstated that he does not have any money to send them now, and that if he does not get \nhis clearance, he will not pay his back taxes. At the hearing, Applicant was asked to \nprovide tax account records and other documentation supporting his claims.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative \ncash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial \nindicators; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by the credit reports, tax records, bankruptcy \nrecords, Applicant\u2019s testimony and admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), (e), and (f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that any of the alleged debts became delinquent under such circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur. His failure to pay his delinquent tax debts, student loans, and \nconsumer debts is recent, ongoing, and not isolated. His behavior continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant claims his financial problems \nstarted when he lost his job in 2008. However, he voluntarily left his job in 2008, without \nfirst securing other employment. He has been consistently employed, but for a few \nmonths since 2010, and has earned a substantial salary. The record shows that he has \nbeen living beyond his means, and has not been responsible in managing his finances. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing that his debts occurred largely due \nto circumstances beyond his control or that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant has received financial counseling. However, he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation to show that his financial problems are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. Only one of the SOR debts is resolved, and that was satisfied after he received \nthe SOR. He did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he had adhered to a good \nfaith effort to repay his creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) do not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Although Applicant disputes the amount or validity of \nsome of his debts, he failed to provide sufficient documentation to substantiate the basis \nfor his dispute, and he did not provide sufficient evidence of his actions to resolve the \nissue. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant has significant unresolved state and federal \nincome tax debt as well as unfiled federal income tax returns.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his work contributions to government missions over \nthe years, his community involvement, and his character letters.

He has a high school diploma and has attended some \ncollege courses without earning an undergraduate degree. He has never been married, \nbut is engaged to be. He has a two-year-old child. He has served in the U.S. Navy \nReserve since 2015. (Items 2, 3, 4, FORM Response) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed five delinquent debts totaling about $43,000 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt is largely comprised of credit cards, but \nalso included a telecommunications debt. Applicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.c, with comments. He denied the two remaining debts, claiming, without corroborating \ndocumentation, that he has paid them. The SOR allegations are established through \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions.  \nApplicant acknowledged falling behind on his debts. His financial issues began in \n2019 when his fianc\u00e9e began a difficult pregnancy that resulted in multiple hospital \nstays and caused her to miss work, thereby diminishing her income. Additionally, in May \n2020, when his son was born, his son\u2019s and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s health required Applicant to \ntake six months of unpaid leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) until about \nNovember 2020. As a result of his and his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s lack of income during this time, \nApplicant used his credit cards to pay for their living expenses. Eventually, he reached \nthe credit limit on these credit cards and could not afford to pay the minimum payments, \nso the accounts became delinquent. (Items 1-6; FORM Response) \nThe credit-card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, totaling approximately $40,000, \nhave not been resolved. These debts are listed as having been charged off on the \nJanuary 2021 credit report. Applicant has contacted the creditor in relation to these \ndebts but has yet to make arrangements to resolve them. His plan is to resolve them \nthrough payments in the future. (Items 1, 2, 6; FORM Response) \nThe credit-card debt for $2,107 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d has been resolved. \nApplicant began making payments on this charged-off debt in 2018 through direct \npayments from his paycheck. It is unclear from the record whether these payments \nwere voluntary or involuntary wage garnishments. Applicant first became delinquent on \nthis debt in 2013. He claimed that he has satisfied this debt through payments and that \nhe attached corroborating documents, but no such documents are part of the record. \nThis debt appears on the 2018 and 2021 credit reports, but the 2021 credit report shows \na lower balance than that on the 2018 credit report. (Items 1-6; FORM Response) \nThe telecommunications debt for $581 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has been resolved. \nThis debt is listed in the January 2021 credit report with an activity date of May 2019. \nApplicant claimed that the creditor failed to close the account when he requested, \nresulting in additional charges.

(Items 1, 2, 6; \nResponse to FORM) \nApplicant listed delinquent student loans on the Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) he submitted in March 2018.1  In his SF 86, he also listed as \ndelinquent the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. These delinquencies predate Applicant\u2019s \nfianc\u00e9e\u2019s 2019 pregnancy and the birth of his son that Applicant claimed caused his \nfinancial problems. (Items 2-6; FORM Response)  \nApplicant submitted letters from friends praising him for his reliability, honesty, \nresponsibility, trustworthiness, and dependability. He also submitted positive military \nperformance evaluations. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n1 I will not consider adverse information not listed in the SOR under the disqualifying factors, but I may \nconsider it when applying matters of extenuation and mitigation, and for the whole-person analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that included significant credit-\ncard debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions and \nshifts the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant provided some evidence to show that the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.e have been resolved through payment. While he has not provided corroborating \ndocumentation of these resolutions, the Government\u2019s exhibits corroborate payments \non the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s character references describe his \nhonesty and trustworthiness. Therefore, I find there is sufficient evidence that he has \nsettled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e through payment, and I find in Applicant\u2019s favor \nwith respect to those SOR allegations under AG \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s and his infant son\u2019s \nhealth problems, because his family lost income as a result. These circumstances were \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, he has not shown that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. While he was out of work for about six months, he ostensibly began \nworking again in late 2020. Therefore, it has been more than one-and-a-half years since \nhe resumed working. Given this extended length of time, there is insufficient evidence to \nshow that Applicant has made any meaningful or good-faith progress in resolving the \ngreater than $40,000 in credit-card delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. While he plans to \npay these delinquencies in the future, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant also had financial delinquencies prior to his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s pregnancy in \n2019. These prior delinquencies detract from his ability to establish that his financial \nproblems are infrequent or occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nApplicant has a substantial amount of unresolved outstanding debt remaining with no \nclear indication that he can or will resolve it. His financial issues continue to cast doubt \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have considered Applicant\u2019s ongoing military \nservice, his positive performance evaluations, and his favorable character references. I \nhave incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The Government exhibits included in the \nFORM and AE A are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since February 2020. He is a high school graduate. He is married \nwith five children and a stepchild. (Items 3, 6) \nApplicant has a long criminal record going back to 1995. Applicant was arrested \nand charged 17 times between 1995 and 2016. He also was a regular marijuana user \nuntil he quit in 2017. The majority of Applicant\u2019s arrests (15) were between 1995 and \n1998. Those charges include multiple drug-related charges, but also include felony \ncharges of assault, burglary, armed criminal action, probation violation, unlawful use of \na weapon, assault on law enforcement, and first-degree murder. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant was convicted of possession of up to 35 grams of marijuana in 1998 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i). He was sentenced to confinement for 180 days (suspended) and probation \nfor one year. He was convicted of possession of up to 35 grams of marijuana in 2000 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k). He was sentenced to confinement for 60 days. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant was acquitted of first degree murder, assault on law enforcement, and \narmed criminal action in 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.o). (Items 4-6) \nApplicant was convicted of two counts of felony possession of a controlled \nsubstance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e) and one count of distribution, delivery, or manufacture of a \ncontrolled substance (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in 2001. He was acquitted of first degree assault (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g). He was sentenced to confinement for seven years (suspended) and probation for \nfive years on each of the possession counts, and confinement for thirteen years \n(suspended) and probation for five years on the distribution, delivery, or manufacture of \na controlled substance count. (Items 1-6) \nAll of Applicant\u2019s convictions through 2001 were for offenses that were committed \nbetween 1995 and 1998. The prosecutors chose not to proceed with charges for the \narrests identified in the SOR that did not result in an acquittal or a conviction. (Items 1-\n6) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance, \nunlawful use of a weapon, and possession of drug paraphernalia in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nThe disposition of the charges is unclear from the record, but there is no evidence that \nApplicant was convicted, and he indicated that the charges were dropped. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated/alcohol in \nAugust 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He was found guilty in April 2018 and sentenced to probation \nfor two years. He completed the terms of his probation in April 2020.

He stated that the gun, drugs, and drug \nparaphernalia seized during the 2013 arrest belonged to someone else. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant was in jail for about two and a half years pending trial for murder and \nother charges. He stated that the time spent in jail was the impetus for changes in his \nlife. He continued to use marijuana, but to a much lesser extent. In 2017, he quit using \nmarijuana completely. He had a good job and a family. He wanted a better life for \nhimself and his family. There is no evidence of any criminal conduct since he stopped \nsmoking marijuana. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant provided an extremely honest and candid response to the FORM. He \nacknowledged his past, and that he may not deserve a security clearance or even a job \nwith his defense-contractor employer. He wrote: \nI\u2019m not proud of the life I use[d] to live but I\u2019m grateful to God that I\u2019m alive \nand free to talk about it. I wish there was a way to bury my past for good \nbut I can\u2019t and I try to face it honestly and head on when asked about it. In \nclosing I understand why a denial is being recommended. I honestly never \nexpected an approval. I sincerely apologize for wasting anyone\u2019s time with \nthis request and I humbly thank you for even reviewing my request. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;\nand \n \n \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s multiple arrests, including an arrest for violating his probation, \nestablish the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s arrests (15) were for crimes committed between 1995 \nand 1998. He stated that he was young and dumb and hung out with the wrong crowd. \nApplicant does not deny committing most of the offenses. He denied committing the \noffenses that resulted in acquittals, including murder and assault on law enforcement. \nHe also denied committing the 2013 charges. The charges that resulted in acquittals \nand the 2013 charges are mitigated. \nApplicant asserted that the two and a half years he spent in jail pending trial for \nmurder was the impetus for changes in his life. I believe his statement about being \nchanged. However, he was arrested for DWI in 2016; he continued to use marijuana \nuntil 2017; and he just completed probation in April 2020. \nApplicant provided an extremely honest and candid response to the FORM. He \nacknowledged his past, and that he may not deserve a security clearance or even a job \nwith his defense-contractor employer. I believe that Applicant now understands that \nthere is more to life than drugs and crime, and that his job and family are what is \nimportant. Unfortunately, at this time, I cannot find his criminal conduct mitigated. His \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nThe above mitigating factors, individually or collectively, are insufficient to dispel the \ncriminal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant\u2019s drug-related charges and marijuana use establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c). \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant has not used marijuana since 2017, more than four years ago. I believe \nhe has put that life behind him. I find that Applicant has abstained from illegal drug use \nfor an appropriate period, and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and J in my whole-person analysis. I agree with Applicant\u2019s assessment \nthat he is not ready for a security clearance at this time. If he maintains his current path, \nhe may reach a time where he is ready. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns, but he did not \nmitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nAt hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered 12 \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were offered into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 13-17; GE 4; AE A-AE L) On December 16, 2021, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing.

(AE M-AE O) The record closed on December 24, 2021. (Tr. 63, 131) \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He did not \nexplain why he denied the SOR allegations. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old project engineer, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since January 2019. (Tr. 20, 25, 80; GE 1) In 2008, he graduated from high \nschool. (Tr. 22) In high school, he was in honors academics and participated in track and \ncross country. (Tr. 22) He graduated from a university with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmechanical engineering and a minor in mathematics. (Tr. 23, 81) In 2016, he received a \nmaster\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering with a concentration in design and \nmanufacturing. (Tr. 23) In 2020, he received a master\u2019s degree in business administration \n(MBA). (Tr. 23) In June 2016, he married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 23, 81) \nHe has never served in the military. (Tr. 81) He has held a security clearance since 2010. \n(Tr. 24, 82) There is no evidence of any security violations.   \nSexual Behavior and Personal Conduct \nThe history of Applicant\u2019s sexual development is detailed in his polygraph \ninterview. (AE L) Prior to September 2016, there is no evidence of illegal sexual conduct \nwith minors. (Id.) His polygraph result was no deception indicated for questions pertaining \nto sexual abuse of minors and viewing child pornography, aside from the offense in \nSeptember 2016. (Id.) \nIn 2016, a large defense contractor employed Applicant. In June 2016, Applicant \nand his spouse moved to the East Coast. (Tr. 28-30) Shortly after he married, his \nemployer moved him to the West Coast for three months, and he was unable to visit his \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nspouse, who remained on the East Coast, except for a brief visit in July 2016. (Tr. 29-31,\n83) Applicant was unable to make friends near his work location on the West Coast, and\nhe became lonely and depressed. (Tr. 32-33, 75, 84) He tried to meet others; however,\nhis overtures were repeatedly rejected. (Tr. 35)   \n \n \n \nIn September 2016, Applicant had been married for three months. (Tr. 78) He said \nhe wanted to meet someone he could socialize with, but not to date. (Tr. 87) He went to \nseveral websites on the Internet. (Tr. 87-88) He clicked a category on the Internet called\n\u201cWet and Lonely\u201d or words to that effect. (Tr. 86, 88) An advertisement suggested that a\nfemale wanted to meet someone to watch Netflix with her; however, the advertisement\nincluded the \u201ccontext of wanting to be taken care of sexually.\u201d (Tr. 89) He responded to\nthe advertisement indicating \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to take care of you or something like that.\u201d (Tr.\n89) He communicated with V on the Internet, who seemed lonely and abandoned. (Tr.\n36, 45) He said his intent was for a platonic relationship, and he pursued the contact \nbecause he was lonely and bored. (Tr. 89) He repeatedly denied that he intended to have\nsex with V. (Tr. 1\n 23-125) He acknowledged that a fair interpretation of his response to V\nwas that he offered to satisfy her sexually. (Tr. 90) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nV said her mother was going to be out of town, and she wanted him to stay over \nat her residence. (Tr. 39, 115) V said she was almost 16 years old. (Tr. 38, 90) He\nconvinced himself that V was joking about her age being only 15. (Tr. 90) She asked for\nmarijuana; however, Applicant \u201cshrugged it off.\u201d (Tr. 115) Applicant said he was not aware\nat the time he communicated with V that his conduct was criminal or \u201clegally bad.\u201d (Tr. \n91) He \u201cshrugged off\u201d the possibility that V was a minor, and did not think about how he \nmight be hurting a minor. (Tr. 92) He denied that he intended to have sex with V. (Tr. 92)\nHe said that he might not even meet with her. (Tr. 115) He said he just wanted to go for \na drive. (Tr. 116) He told the detectives who interviewed him after his arrest that a fair \ninterpretation of V would be that he wanted to have sex with her; however, he claimed he\nplanned to sit in his car and think about it, and then \u201che would have changed his mind \nand left but \u2018didn\u2019t get the chance\u2019\u201d to leave without having sex with V. (AE O at 24)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI requested that Applicant provide the police report or court records pertaining to \nthe allegation in light of his statements about his lack of intent to engage in sexual activity \nwith V. After the hearing, he provided the police report. The police report said that \nApplicant wrote in emails or texts several comments to V of a sexual nature, for example, \nhe said that he \u201cwanted V\u2019s wet p____y tightly around [his] throbbing c__;\u201d and he \u201cwanted \nto eat her p____y to make her wet for him;\u201d and in response to her comment about being \n15, he said that he liked \u201cyounger girls.\u201d (AE O at 9, 12, 21, 30, 52, 54-55) He responded \nto V stating she was 15, that her age was not a problem for him. (AE O at 9, 12, 21, 30, \n52) \nV was actually a law enforcement officer who was acting as a 15-year-old girl. She \nsuggested that Applicant engage in oral sex with her. (Tr. 114) Applicant agreed to meet \nV for sex prior to driving to her apartment. He had been drinking four to six beers over \nabout five hours, and he considered himself to be \u201cdefinitely buzzed,\u201d and he had been \ntaking his medication for ADHD. (Tr. 94-97) However, he said he did not drive while \nintoxicated or impaired when he went to see V. (Tr. 97-98) \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant drove about 30 minutes to the location where he was supposed to meet \nV. (Tr. 98) He had a condom in his wallet before he got into the car, and he took the \ncondom out of his wallet. (Tr. 117) He did not bring any condoms, alcohol, or marijuana \nfor his meeting with V. (Tr. 116-117) He parked in a parking lot near V\u2019s building, and the \npolice arrested him for Communication with a Minor for Immoral Purposes via Electronic \nCommunications, a felony. (Tr. 40, 98) His father-in-law provided his bail. (Tr. 47) He \ninformed his boss of his arrest the morning after he was released from jail. (Tr. 47) As a \ncondition of release pending disposition of the charge, Applicant agreed not to use the \nInternet, and his employer placed him on a leave of absence. (Tr. 27) \nIn October 2018, Applicant pleaded guilty to Communication with a Minor for \nImmoral Purposes via Electronic Communications, and he was sentenced to 30 days in\njail, a year of probation, an $800 fine and court costs, and to register as a sexual offender.\n(Tr. 53-55) Applicant denied that his purpose was to engage in sexual activity with V. (Tr.\n41) He was unclear about the \u201cimmoral purpose\u201d involved in his offense. \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that Applicant violated the rules for sex-offender registration \nwhen he resided within 1,000 feet of a school. Violation of this rule is a Class D felony. \nSee state M Rev. Stat. \u00a7 566.1407. \nIn 2017, Applicant and his spouse purchased a house (H). (Tr. 56, 101-102) When \nhe attempted to register as a sex offender in 2018, his registration was rejected because \nthe address he provided for H was within 1,000 feet of a school. (Tr. 57) He attempted to \nlease several apartments; however, the state\u2019s computer rejected his applications to \nregister as a sex offender because of their proximity to schools. (Tr. 57) Eventually, he \nfound an apartment he could lease that met the school-distance criteria, and he was able \nto complete his registration as a sex offender. (Tr. 58-59, 100) His spouse lives at H, and \nApplicant spends about half of his time at H. (Tr. 69, 103) He keeps his valuable items at \nH. (Tr. 103) He uses the mailing address of H. (Tr. 69-70) He keeps his clothing at his \napartment and at H. (Tr. 103) He considered the apartments he leased to be his \nresidences. (Tr. 70-72) He is aware that the legal standard for residence for sex-offender \nregistration in his state is the location where he sleeps. (Tr. 104) He slept in H on the \nfollowing occasions: when his spouse had a medical emergency; when the heat was not \nworking in his apartment; and on a couple of other occasions with the permission of his \nprobation officer. (Tr. 104-107) He contacts his former probation officer if he has \nquestions about what he is permitted to do under the state\u2019s sex-offender registration \nrestrictions. (Tr. 105-106)  \nIn 2017, Applicant attended church-sponsored therapy and counseling. (Tr. 62, \n110) During his post-trial probation, Applicant attended weekly sex-offender treatment \nsessions (Tr. 60-62; AE E and AE F) In April 2019, he successfully completed his \nprobation and paid all fines and court costs. (Tr. 66-67; AE G; AE H) After completion of \none year of probation, he continued to attend therapy and counseling sessions even \nthough he was not legally required to continue with therapy and counseling. (Tr. 65-66; \nAE E) His counselor said, he \u201cis currently at no/low risk to reoffend. It is this writer\u2019s \nopinion that [Applicant] is making the necessary changes to live a good and productive \nlife.\u201d (AE E) On January 18, 2021, his counselor wrote that he \u201csuccessfully completed \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe treatment requirement of his psychotherapy.\u201d (AE F) Applicant\u2019s family, including his \nspouse and in-laws, have been very supportive of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. (Tr. 59-60, \n67-68, 77) His spouse was approved to be his supervisor when he is around minors, for \nexample, when he attended a major league baseball game. (Tr. 68-69) \nApplicant disclosed his conviction and why he left his previous employment to his \ncurrent employer and his facility security officer. (Tr. 73-74) Aside from the offense in \nSeptember 2016, Applicant has not communicated with any minors about sex. (Tr. 50) \nHe did not engage in sexual behavior with minors after September 2016 because it would \nupset his wife; he lacks sexual interest in minors; and it is unlawful. (Tr. 50-51) He has \nnever viewed any child pornography. (Tr. 52) In January 2021, he was diagnosed with, \nand he has been receiving treatment for, depression and anxiety. (Tr. 84-85) He regrets \nhis bad decision that resulted in his conviction. (Tr. 44) His marriage is important to him. \n(Tr. 44) He has learned to communicate better with his spouse. (Tr. 50, 76) He has \nlearned coping mechanisms to address his feelings when he is lonely. (Tr. 75) He is more \nreligious now. (Tr. 44) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant is dedicated to self-improvement, and he loves his employment and \nwants to contribute to his country through his employment. (Tr. 126-127) He participated \nin several volunteer activities in his community. (AE D) He held multiple leadership roles \nrelated to his employment and national defense. (Id.) He received excellent performance \nevaluations, and he made important contributions to his employer. (AE I; AE J) He \nreceived an award from his university for his success during the 10 years after he \ngraduated from the university. (AE K) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) \nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply. In October 2018, Applicant pleaded guilty to \nCommunication with a Minor for Immoral Purposes via Electronic Communications. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) partially applies and 32(d) fully applies. The offenses were committed \nduring September 2016, and are not particularly recent. However, his employer might \ntemporarily reassign him or he might otherwise be separated from his spouse and family, \nand the unusual circumstances involving his loneliness might recur, making him \nvulnerable to poor judgment and decisions. He served his sentence and successfully \ncompleted probation, therapy, and counseling. He has learned from his mistakes, and is \nunlikely to repeat the particular charged offense to which he pleaded guilty. He is well \neducated, diligent, and successful in his employment. He engaged in constructive \ncommunity involvement. He expressed remorse for his criminal offense. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant committed a serious \ncriminal offense. He solicited sexual intercourse and sodomy with a person he believed \nto be 15 years old. His vulgar communications with her showed a clear desire to engage \nin sex with her. She agreed to engage in sexual activities with him, and he drove 30 \nminutes to her location. After he parked near her building, the police arrested him. \nAfter careful consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on criminal \noffenses, and all the facts and circumstances, I have continuing doubts about the risks \nthat Applicant will make poor decisions. While there is no evidence of criminal conduct \nbefore or after September 2016, it is too soon to conclude poor decisions or compromise \nof classified information is unlikely to recur. Not enough time has elapsed without serious \npremeditated misconduct to eliminate doubt about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct concerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe LOR alleges three disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of:  . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3) do not apply. SOR \u00b6 2.a indicates Applicant violated state \nsex-offender rules when he maintained a residence within 1,000 feet of a school. Violation \nof this rule is a criminal offense. Guideline J is the most appropriate guideline for \nApplicant\u2019s alleged violation of the sex-offender registration statute. The previous sections \nindicate sufficient evidence for an adverse determination. AG \u00b6 16(e) does not apply \nbecause his registration as a sex offender is publicly available, and his family, security, \nlaw enforcement, and employer are aware of that he is a registered sex offender. He \ndiscussed his conduct at his hearing. Moreover, Applicant complied in good faith with \nresidence requirements for his state registration as a sex offender. He understands there \nis significant jeopardy if he sleeps overnight in H without permission of his former \nprobation officer or other state officials. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old project engineer, who has worked for defense \ncontractors since 2010. He graduated from a university with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmechanical engineering and a minor in mathematics. In 2016, he received a master\u2019s \ndegree in mechanical engineering with a concentration in design and manufacturing. In \n2020, he received an MBA. In June 2016, he married, and he does not have any children. \nHe has held a security clearance since 2010, and there is no evidence of a security \nviolation.   \nApplicant is dedicated to self-improvement, and he loves his employment and \nwants to continue to contribute to his country through his employment. He participated in \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nseveral volunteer activities in his community. He held multiple leadership roles related to \nhis employment and national defense. He received excellent performance evaluations, \nand he made important contributions to his employer. He received an award from his \nuniversity for his success during the 10 years after he graduated from the university. \nThe factors weighing against continuation of his security clearance are more \nsubstantial than the mitigating circumstances. In October 2018, Applicant pleaded guilty \nto Communication with a Minor for Immoral Purposes via Electronic Communications in \nSeptember 2016, and he was sentenced to 30 days in jail, a year of probation, to pay a \nfine and court costs, and to register as a sexual offender. After making lewd comments \nto someone he believed to be a 15-year-old girl in September 2016 and agreeing to \nengage in sexual activity with her, he drove 30 minutes to be with her after she informed \nhim that her mother was out, and she was willing to engage in intercourse and sodomy \nwith him. He was arrested before he could enter her building. His actions demonstrated \nexceptionally poor judgment and cause lingering concerns that his judgment might be \ncompromised in the context of protection of classified information. I am not confident that \nhe would disclose compromise of classified information in the event that his own career \nwould be jeopardized. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are refuted; however, criminal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n10 \n Paragraph 2, Guideline E:  \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On May 17, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. Processing of Applicant\u2019s case was delayed due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. On April 5, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On June 7, 2022, DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing, setting his hearing for June 21, 2022. His hearing was held \nas scheduled using the Microsoft Teams teleconference system. During the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel made a motion to add an additional SOR allegation (\u00b6 1.p.) under \nGuideline F. Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the new SOR allegation, and alternatively \nargued that if the allegation is added to the SOR, Applicant required additional time for a \nproper response. I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to add the allegation, which \nread: \nSOR \u00b6 1.p Applicant fraudulently filed his 2021 federal income tax return when he \nidentified three children who are neither biological nor adopted as his grandchildren when \nhe claimed he was eligible for the child tax credit. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s Counsel\u2019s request for a continuance to respond to the new \nSOR allegation. The hearing was adjourned and a new hearing was scheduled for August \n10, 2022. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven Government exhibits (GE) \n1-7; Applicant offered four exhibits (AE) A-D; there were no objections; and all proffered \nexhibits were admitted into evidence. Applicant\u2019s Counsel also noted on the record that \nhis client denied the new allegation. (SOR \u00b6 1.p) Applicant, his wife, and a tax expert \ntestified during the hearing. On June 28, 2022, DOHA received a transcript of the initial \nhearing that was continued, and on August 17, 2022, a transcript (Tr.) of the final hearing \nwas delivered. I held the record open until August 31, 2022, in the event either party \nwanted to supplement the record. On August 29, 2022, Applicant\u2019s Counsel provided two \ndocuments, AE E and F, and requested additional time to submit other documentation. I \ngranted an additional two weeks to hold the record open, without objection. On \nSeptember 16, 2022, Applicant\u2019s Counsel again requested additional time to submit \ndocumentation due to Applicant\u2019s extended illness with COVID. I granted a final extension \nto hold the record open until October 11, 2022. Counsel submitted two post-hearing \ndocuments, AE G and AE H.

His monthly net salary is about $9,700. For \napproximately the past eight years, he has worked as a federal contractor with a two-\nmonth break in employment in 2017. In 2006, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree from an \non-line university. He married in 1999, and he does not have any children. His wife is \nmedically disabled and unemployed. He currently possesses a DOD security clearance. \n(GE 1, GE 2; AE F; Tr. 24-25, 30-34, 36-37, 49, 64-66, 93, 107) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant stated during his October 2020 background interview that he is able to \nlive within his means and pay his debts. He admitted that he had multiple medical debts \nthat were currently unpaid. The majority of the medical bills resulted from his wife and \ngrandchild\u2019s medical issues. The authorized DOD investigator showed Applicant his credit \nreport revealing two delinquent student loans, two vet bills, a consumer cash loan, and \nseveral outstanding medical accounts. Applicant was surprised at the total number and \ncombined amount of his delinquent accounts, some of which became delinquent in 2015. \nHe stated that it was his intention to obtain a credit report and contact the creditors to \ndetermine if the balances owed were legitimate. If a balance was legitimate, he intended \nto satisfy the account; if the balance was not substantiated, he intended to dispute the \ndelinquent account. (GE 2) \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife testified that she has been hospitalized three times \nwithin the past two years. She suffered from cancer, aphasia, cellulitis, and she had a \nportion of her lung removed. Numerous medical bills accrued that they are unable to pay. \nShe is not qualified for disability income because the government determined that \nApplicant earns too much money. Applicant also has medical out-of-pocket expenses not \ncovered by insurance that are related to his diabetes and sleep apnea. (Tr. 25-29, 52-55, \n60; AE C) \nApplicant stated that he earns about $128,000 annually. His wife\u2019s cousin and her \nthree children reside with Applicant and his wife. In July 2011, Applicant and his wife were \ngranted legal custody of the older two children, and the mother was ordered to pay child \nsupport to Applicant and his wife. Applicant stated that the youngest child was also legally \nplaced into their care. The children\u2019s mother works as a school employee, and earns \nbetween $1,500 - $2,000 monthly during the school year. She also receives monthly \ndisability payments of about $2,000 from the Veteran\u2019s Administration due to her previous \nservice in the U.S. Army. Applicant accepts financial responsibility for the three children \nin his custody, and he charges his wife\u2019s cousin $900 a month for living in their house. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show whether the children\u2019s mother also \npays child support to Applicant. (Tr. 64, 67-69; AE D) \nApplicant testified that while he was unemployed for approximately two months in \n1987, he received a phone call from his student loan creditor. He explained that he was \ncurrently unemployed and the student loan provider gave him a six-month forbearance \nbefore he was required to start student loan payments. He was initially on an income-\nbased payment plan, but when the plan lapsed, the loan payments increased to almost \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$2,000 a month. He could not afford to make these payments. In about September 2017, \nhe decided he would allow his student loans to go into default, and then he would \nrehabilitate them. When he later attempted to communicate with the student loan provider \nto rehabilitate his defaulted student loans, he was unable to make contact. He tried on \nmultiple occasions to make contact with the student loan provider without success. Over \nthe years, he admitted receiving letters from the student loan creditor, but he denied \nreceiving correspondence within the past two years. Applicant last made a payment on \nhis delinquent student loans in about August 2017. The total amount of his delinquent \nstudent loans alleged in the SOR is $82,787. (Tr. 50-52, 86-92) \nApplicant testified that his short-term plan for resolving his student loans is to begin \nmaking interest-only payments so that his student loan balance does not continue to \nincrease. His long-term plan is to use his inheritance from his father\u2019s estate when his \nfather passes away. In addition, Applicant has an elderly friend who has promised that he \nwould inherit half of his estate. Applicant estimated that the inheritance money should \nfully cover the outstanding student loan balance. (Tr. 60-61) \nIn approximately 2005, Applicant participated in the Dave Ramsey financial \nprogram. At that time, he and his spouse had recently filed for bankruptcy. After their case\nwas discharged, they successfully handled their financial obligations for several years\nuntil Applicant\u2019s wife became ill and the medical bills accumulated. They focused on\npaying off the smallest bills. He estimated that they resolved about $5,000 of their\ndelinquent debt. Applicant testified that he had joined a consumer credit counseling\n(CCC) program on the same day as his hearing. He will begin making payments through\nthis CCC service next month. Other than his outstanding student loans, he now believes\nhe only has five accounts in collection. There was no documentation to show what specific\naccounts were included in the CCC repayment plan. Post-hearing documentation showed\nthat Applicant made his first monthly payment of $203 in September 2022.

It showed that his monthly \nnet income was $9,500 and he received $900 from his wife\u2019s cousin each month.

According to the chart above, groceries for a family of six cost \n$545 each week; pets (four cats and 1 dog) costs averaged about $112 each week; \ntoiletries, school supplies, clothing, and personal care items cost about $380 each week. \nApplicant resubmitted an amended monthly budget post-hearing.

(GE 7, AE \nB, AE D, AE E; Tr. 103-106) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(f) is refuted by documentation submitted by the tax expert. The \nrecord establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

He had a previous \nbankruptcy and discharge, but his finances once again became delinquent. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely affected his finances, including \nunforeseen medical issues and receiving custody of three children. However, \u201c[e]ven if \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \nThere is sufficient evidence that the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.f, totaling about $305, have been paid. I find that Applicant mitigated these SOR medical \naccounts. \nApplicant\u2019s income is six-figures. His most recent budget showed that he had \napproximately $1,100 left over at the end of the month after paying expenses, to include \nhis CCC monthly payment plan. He did not provide sufficient documentation explaining \nwhy he was unable to make greater documented progress resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g through 1.o, especially considering his consistent employment history and income. \nHe did not provide supporting documentary evidence that he maintained contact with \nthese creditors, had evidence of settlements or written offers to settle with the creditor, or \nproof that these delinquent accounts were included in his recent CCC repayment plan. \nAssuming that the debts were included in the CCC repayment plan, post-hearing \ndocumentation shows that Applicant made one monthly payment of $203 in September \n2022. There is insufficient evidence to establish a track record of steady payments, or \ngood-faith mitigation of his unresolved delinquent SOR debt.   \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes $82,787 for two delinquent student loans \nreferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. He last made a payment on \nhis loans in 2017, and allowed them to go into default. A security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. \nAccordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on \nan Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While these debts are in a \ndeferment status because of the pandemic, Applicant had already defaulted on them prior \nto the deferment. When student loans are placed in a deferment status after being in \ndefault, Applicant\u2019s past inactions are not excused in the context of security clearance \neligibility. None of the above mitigating conditions are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through \n1.o. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant has a history of not responsibly meeting financial obligations. He did not provide \ndocumentation explaining why he was unable to make greater progress resolving the debt \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.o, since he was placed on notice in October 2020 of the \ngovernment\u2019s concern about his financial issues. He has done little to address his debts \ndespite his apparent ability to pay, or to take appropriate action to investigate and resolve \ndelinquent debts. His lack of responsible financial action over the last two years raises \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debt, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligation, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. I have carefully applied the law, \nas set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since December 2017. He was granted a DOD security clearance \nin January 2019. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2005. He has never been married and has no children. (Items 4, 5) \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related criminal offenses, alleged under \nGuideline G and cross-alleged under Guideline J. In about April 1998, he was charged \nwith public intoxication in State A and fined. In September 1998, he sought in-patient \nalcohol counseling because he believed that he might be drinking too much. He ceased \nthis counseling after about three days because he decided that he did not have a \nproblem with alcohol after hearing about the other attendees\u2019 issues. Applicant believes \nthat his record with respect to this charge of public intoxication has been expunged from \nhis criminal record. (Items 3-5; AE AA, BB, EE; Enclosure 3) \nApplicant was arrested in 2000 in State A and charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI). He spent the night in jail. As a result of this DUI, he had to complete 40 \nhours of community service, a DUI course, and have an ignition interlock device \ninstalled on his car. He received a two-year deferred sentence. He believes that his \n2000 DUI has been expunged from his record. As a result of this DUI, Applicant \nreduced his drinking to about two beers at a time, once every two months. (Items 3, 5; \nAE EE; Enclosure 3) \nApplicant was arrested again in July 2002 in State A and charged with DUI after \na night out with friends. He again spent the night in jail. Applicant pleaded guilty. He \nreceived a two-year deferred sentence, had an ignition interlock device placed on his \nvehicle, and attended a DUI school for 12 hours. He completed all the requirements of \nhis deferred sentence. After this DUI, Applicant reduced his drinking to no more than \ntwo or three beers on any occasion, only drank twice per year, and never drove a \nvehicle after he consumed alcohol.

He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings in an effort to mitigate his alcohol issues and related legal problems. He \nattended AA meetings from 2011 until 2016.

As part of a plan to improve his health, he abstained from alcohol for over four \nyears. He resumed drinking in the summer of 2016, and consumed one to three beers \nonce per month until the end of 2016. From 2017 until September 2019, he drank about \none to three servings of alcohol about six times per year. (Items 3-5; AE G; Enclosure 3) \nIn October 2019, Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with Aggravated \nDUI after a night out with friends. His blood alcohol content was measured at either .16 \nor .18, after he had been arrested and taken to jail. Applicant pleaded nolo contendere \nto a lesser charge of non-aggravated DUI, for which he received a deferred one-year \nsentence with unsupervised probation, 50 hours of community service, and about \n$1,700 in fines. He was also ordered to install an ignition interlock system on his \nvehicle. Applicant completed all of his post-sentencing requirements and paid all of his \nfines. He completed a 24-hour alcohol and drug abuse course, a victim input panel, and \na six-week substance abuse group through State A. (Items 3, 4, 5, 7; AE EE, DD; \nEnclosure 3) \n \nApplicant resumed attending AA meetings again in October 2019, after his 2019 \nDUI arrest. He had a \u201csmall\u201d glass of champagne on December 31, 2019, New Years\u2019 \nEve. In connection with his resumed AA participation, he has again completed the 12-\nstep program and has received his one, three, six, and nine-month sobriety chips. After \nmoving to Country A for his job, he continued attending AA meetings two to three times \nper week online and obtained a new AA sponsor, who is a citizen and resident of \nCountry A. (Items 3, 5; AE G, H, EE; Enclosure 3) \nIn a written statement attached to his October 2021 SOR response Applicant \ncommitted to never drinking again. He claimed that no one had ever advised him or \nrecommended to him that he should fully and permanently abstain from alcohol. \n(Enclosure 3) \nApplicant submitted a Drug and Alcohol Assessment, dated February 16, 2022, \nfrom an individual who is a licensed social worker and licensed chemical dependency \ncounselor III (Clinical Evaluator). The Clinical Evaluator reviewed the results of \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse screening test, a Michigan alcohol screening test, and a \nproprietary mental health screening. The Clinical Evaluator opined that, despite \nApplicant\u2019s written screenings providing evidence of problem alcohol use, \u201cthe drinking \nhabits\u201d Applicant \u201cacknowledges are insignificant enough for alcohol abuse disorder \u2026.\u201d \n(AE EE, FF) \nApplicant submitted letters from friends, acquaintances, co-workers, and fellow \nAA participants praising him for his reliability, honesty, responsibility, trustworthiness, \ndependability, integrity, and charitable work.

He provided several suggestions \u201cto ensure \nmonitoring and enforcement of the conditions.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s response to FORM) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was cited for public intoxication in 1998 and arrested for DUI in 2000, \n2002, and 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) The above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has an extensive history of poor decisions involving alcohol. He \nincurred four alcohol-related citations and charges over a 21-year period, including \nthree DUI arrests, most recently in 2019. While he asserted that he has been sober \nsince December 31, 2019, it is troubling that he drank alcohol just several months after \nbeing charged with his third DUI and after he resumed attending AA meetings. Applicant \nhas never been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder and claims to not be addicted to \nalcohol. If true, he is voluntarily making poor choices involving alcohol. These poor \nchoices and his past unwillingness to stop drinking and driving despite the glaring \nevidence that he should, leave me with doubts about his current reliability and \njudgment. Additionally, his most recent decision to moderate his alcohol consumption \nappears to be motivated by his desire to obtain a security clearance, rather than an \nacknowledgement that he has a problem with alcohol, which leaves me with doubts that \nhis behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAs to AG \u00b6 23(b), Applicant is credited with addressing his alcohol issues \nthrough resumed participation in AA. However, I have lingering concerns related to \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to violate the law and place others in danger. He has driven a \nvehicle after consuming alcohol to excess at least three times, resulting in three DUI \nconvictions, most recently in October 2019. Given that Applicant has repeatedly \nrelapsed after committing to either reduced consumption of alcohol or abstinence, I also \nhave doubts regarding whether he has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption and compliance with the law. AG \u00b6 23(b) does not fully apply. In \nshort, given Applicant\u2019s track record, more time is needed for Applicant to demonstrate \nthat he has fully mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol issues. \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d At this time, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome ongoing concerns about his \nalcohol use, reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s public intoxication charge and three DUIs establish the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not been charged with a crime since October 2019. He has a \nstrong work record, favorable character evidence, and there is evidence of his \ncommunity involvement. He has complied with the terms of his probation and made \nrestitution for his criminal activity. However, these facts are insufficient to overcome his \nthree-time DUI history, the last of which involved a charge of Aggravated DUI. While AG \n\u00b6 32(d) partially applies, I have unmitigated concerns for the same reasons discussed in \nmy analysis of the the alcohol consumption concerns, above. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character and employment evidence. \nAlthough the adjudicative guidelines provide the authority to grant conditional \neligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue information that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated, with the provision that additional security measures shall be \nrequired to mitigate the issue(s),\u201d the facts do not warrant it in this case. I conclude that \na conditional clearance is not appropriate for the reasons stated above. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

His annual income at the time was about \n$96,000. Her annual income was between $15,000 and $20,000. Since 2001, he has \nbeen continually employed with health insurance for him and his family, and he now earns \nabout $121,000 annually. His wife also could not work for an unspecified time starting in \nearly 2020 because their children had to attend school virtually. The children have \nreturned to in-person learning, but his wife now works only sporadically depending on \nhow she feels physically. (Tr. 48 \u2013 50, 60, 69, 78 \u2013 79, 86 \u2013 87) \nThe documentary information Applicant provided shows he has settled for lesser \namounts the debts alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.e. He also provided information showing \nthat he resolved a credit card debt owed to the creditor listed at SOR 1.d; however, that \naccount is different than the account addressed in SOR 1.d, which remains unresolved. \n(GX 2 \u2013 3; AX A \u2013 D; Tr. 39 \u2013 41, 75 \u2013 78) \nThe debts alleged at SOR 1.b and 1.f are for delinquent credit card accounts owed \nto the same creditor. That creditor filed civil suits to collect the debts, which total more \nthan $25,000. The civil suits were dismissed in June 2021 and January 2022 after \nApplicant hired an attorney to respond to the suits. He paid a retainer for legal services \nbut acknowledged at hearing that he did not pay anything directly to the creditor. Despite \nthe dismissal of the civil suits, I find from all of the available information that these debts \nremain unresolved. (GX 3; AX E; Tr. 71 \u2013 75, 89 \u2013 90) \nApplicant disclosed all of the SOR debts in Section 26 (Financial Record) of his \nFebruary 2020 e-QIP, and he indicated his intention to contact his creditors to \u201ctake care \nof it.\u201d Nonetheless, he did not take any action to resolve any of his debts until after he \nreceived the SOR more than a year later. He has not taken any action regarding the SOR \n1.a account since trying to contact that creditor around the time he received the SOR. A \ncredit report dated August 5, 2022, shows that, since 2020, he has opened additional \ncredit card accounts on which he is current but carries high balances. In April 2022, he \npurchased a new home for $374,600. To obtain that mortgage, he made a down payment \nof about $13,000, which he borrowed from family members and is still repaying. In \nNovember 2022, Applicant financed the purchase of a new car for about $38,000 after \nmaking a $3,000 down payment he borrowed from his brother, a debt he has since repaid. \n(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 65 \u2013 68, 78 \u2013 79, 85) \nApplicant\u2019s wife was not seriously injured as a result of her car accident; however, \nshe has suffered back pain at times. In November 2021, in an effort to alleviate that pain, \nshe underwent cosmetic surgery (commonly referred to as a \u201ctummy tuck\u201d) to reduce the \nsize of her abdomen. In July 2022, she had another surgery due to complications from \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe first procedure. Neither procedure was covered by Applicant\u2019s medical insurance, so \nhis wife opened a credit account to pay between $12,000 and $20,000 for the procedures. \nBecause Applicant is, for all intents and purposes, the sole income earner in the family, \nhe will have to pay that debt. (Tr. 50 \u2013 60) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife had her car accident in 2018, his annual salary was about \n$96,000. By 2021, his salary had increased through annual adjustments to about \n$121,000. His net pay each week is about $1,800, which equates to at least $7,000 in \nmonthly take-home pay. From that, he reports he pays a monthly mortgage of about \n$2,755 (with taxes and insurance) and about $600 for a car payment. He estimates that \nafter all of his monthly expenses (utilities, phones, internet, food, gas, insurance, etc.), he \nhas between $2,000 and $4,000 remaining. Applicant files his state and federal income \ntax returns on time each year; however, at his hearing he disclosed that he was four \nmonths late in paying a 2021 tax year bill of about $900. Other than his responses to \nquestions at his hearing, Applicant has not any information about how he manages his \nmonthly finances. He also did not produce any information about how he plans to resolve \nhis remaining debts. (Tr. 48 \u2013 51, 62 \u2013 65, 80 \u2013 85) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport all of the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past due or \ndelinquent debt that, with one exception, is still outstanding. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAfter a thorough review of this record, I conclude that none of these mitigating \nconditions can be applied. In response to the Government\u2019s prima facie case for \ndisqualification, Applicant did not meet his burden of refuting or mitigating the \nGovernment\u2019s information. He showed that only the debts at SOR 1.c and 1.e have been \naddressed. All of the remaining debts at issue, totaling $44,116, are still unresolved. \nApplicant has not contacted the SOR 1.a creditor since he received the SOR; his \ninformation about the SOR 1.d creditor addressed a different account with that company; \nand the dismissal of the civil suits over the SOR 1.b and 1.f does not mean those debts \nare paid or otherwise resolved. Accordingly, his financial problems are recent, multiple, \nand ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe loss of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income constituted an unexpected circumstance in \n2018 and 2019; however, Applicant already had accrued the debts alleged in the SOR. \nEven though he was still making a good salary that continued to increase over the next \ntwo years, he did not address any of his debts until after he received the SOR in April \n2021. The record does not show that he acted responsibly in response to the loss of his \nwife\u2019s income, either from the car accident or the need to stay home during the Covid-19 \npandemic. The same information undermines any claim that he made good-faith efforts \nto resolve his past-due debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. \nFinally, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has not sought any professional \ncounseling or assistance to resolve his debts or improve his ability to manage his personal \nfinances, and there are no indications his financial problems are under control. To the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \ncontrary, it appears he did not modify his spending and borrowing practices when his wife \nhad her accident or during the pandemic. Rather than address his debts and reduce his \nexpenses, he bought a house and a new car. Normally, these are not indicative of a \nproblem, but Applicant had to borrow cash for his down payments from relatives and still \nwas not addressing his past-due debts. He also now has to pay for elective cosmetic \nsurgery for his wife, and he has continued to open new credit accounts since 2020, when \nhis wife was out of work due to the pandemic. Finally, he has yet to pay his 2021 tax bill \nfour months (as of the hearing) after filing his return, i.e., when they were due. All of the \nforegoing undermines confidence that Applicant will resolve his remaining delinquencies \nin the foreseeable future or that such financial problems will not recur. On balance, the \nsecurity concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information remain unresolved. \nI also have considered the potential application of AG \u00b6 20(e). The record evidence \nas a whole presents significant remaining doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability. He was already accruing excessive personal debt when his wife stopped \nearning income. His unwillingness to address his debts until after he received the SOR, \nalong with the lack of any coherent plan for paying his remaining debts and improving his \nfinancial circumstances, only reinforce doubts about his suitability for continued access \nto classified information. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus \nof these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \n\u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . and \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nabuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or  \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nApplicant admitted using marijuana with varying frequency from about April 2011 \nuntil April 2020, May 2020, or December 2020 (or thereafter). The exact end date is \nunclear and immaterial. In any event, Applicant was a regular user of marijuana for nine \nyears or more. In addition, if Applicant did stop in April 2020, he had difficulty continuing \nhis cessation, resuming use in December 2020. Furthermore, his history of use shows a \nfailure to control the habit, even when confronted with the potential inability to obtain a \nqualification that may be necessary for his continued employment or professional \nadvancement. Facts admitted by an applicant in an Application, an answer to an SOR, or \nin an interview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at \n4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995). Applicant\u2019s years of past use of marijuana trigger disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c). In addition, Applicant suggested he would \u201creconsider\u201d \nstopping using marijuana, if his position \u201cexplicitly forbids it.\u201d Applicant did not \u201cclearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue\u201d marijuana use. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(g) applies. \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant began using marijuana \nmore than 11 years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. Applicant has, \nhowever, continued his regular, and not infrequent, use until April 2020, at the earliest. \nAnd Applicant may continue to use marijuana, unless it is expressly forbidden by the \nposition of trust for which he has applied. His history of use shows an inability or \nunwillingness to comply with federal law and casts doubt on his trustworthiness and \nreliability. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana is not mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(a).  \nWhole-Person Concept \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe record raises doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect sensitive information.

I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.- 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n  Conclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to sensitive information. \nPhilip J.

In 2007, Applicant admitted to masturbating in \nhis ex-wife\u2019s home while he watched his preteen daughter and her friend sunbathing \nthrough a window. Before the second polygraph examination, the polygraph examiner \ngave Applicant a document memorializing the information Applicant revealed during the \nfirst examination. Applicant reviewed and signed that document. During the second \npolygraph examination, Applicant confirmed the information he disclosed during the first \ninterview. In the final report, the polygraph examiner noted that Applicant \u201cin some \nrespects rationalized and minimized his behavior.\u201d (GE 4-5) \nDOD CAF referred Applicant for a psychological evaluation in March 2020. The \npsychological interview consisted of a clinical interview with Applicant and a \nconsultation with Applicant\u2019s current marriage counselor. He completed the Personality \nAssessment Inventory (PAI) and Garos Sexual Behavior Inventory (GSBI) - a test \ndesigned to assess for problems related to sexuality and sexual behavior. Neither test \nrevealed any areas on concern. However, the psychologist noted that Applicant\u2019s \nresponses to the personality assessment indicated an attempt to portray himself in a \nfavorable light. The results indicated that Applicant may be hesitant to admit minor faults \nto himself as well as others. The psychologist noted that although the results did not \nindicate any attempts to intentionally distort the findings of the assessment, his \ntendency toward repressing undesirable characteristics indicated that the results of the \nassessment should be reviewed with caution. The results of the sexual behavior \ninventory indicated that Applicant responded to the items in an inconsistent manner. His \nscore on this test indicated a 96% likelihood of random responding. The psychologist \nnoted that Applicant did not rush through the inventory, but appeared to approach the \nquestions carefully, which may suggest an attempt at impression management. (GE 9) \nThe psychologist noted that Applicant\u2019s explanations about his behavior showed \nflawed and questionable judgment. His behavior, the psychologist opined, raised \nquestions which were unable to be answered with confidence through the assessment. \nThe psychologist found that while Applicant\u2019s defensiveness and denial to himself about \nthe incidents resulted in his flawed justifications for his actions, he did not engage in \nconscious attempts to distort or provide inaccurate information about them. The \npsychologist did not find any current issues with emotional or behavior functions that \nrequired a mental health diagnosis. Ultimately, the psychologist concluded that despite \nclear instances of poor judgment, Applicant did not have any current impairment in \njudgment or decision-making as it pertained to his work responsibilities, and that he did \nnot present any clinically significant issues that contributed to concerns about his \nongoing security worthiness. The evaluating psychologist did not have access to the \nOGA reports that serve as the basis for the SOR allegations. (GE 9) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of his behavior is consistent with the polygraph \nexaminer\u2019s observations and the evaluating psychologist\u2019s assessment. In addition to \nhis testimony at the hearing, the record contains Applicant\u2019s statements to the OGA, the \nDOD CAF, a background investigator, the evaluating psychologist, and DOHA about his \nconduct.

He couched his statements as a desire to clear up \nthe inaccuracies of the record created by OGA. \nHe admitted masturbating while watching minor girls or while being in the vicinity \nof minor girls, but denied that the girls were the object of his sexual interest. He \nconfessed the incidents because they did not feel right to him and that he wanted to be \nhonest. He denied ever intentionally searching for child pornography, but stated that he \nfelt guilty looking at pornography with adult women with child-like appearances. \nAccording to Applicant, he believed the purpose of the polygraph examination was to \ndetermine if he was a potential target for exploitation by a hostile entity. He thought that \nif he disclosed these incidents, they would no longer be a potential source of \nvulnerability. (Tr. 20-28, 35-39, 41, 44-49 GE 2, 3, 6, 8) \nApplicant considers himself to be very security conscious. He reported that he \nhas never mishandled classified information and that he is very careful not to discuss or \ndisclose the details of his employment with others. He also admitted no one else is \naware of his behavior. He only disclosed it to the polygraph examiner in January 2015. \nAlthough he admitted that his behavior bothered him and served as a source of shame, \nhe has not sought any counseling or other professional intervention for his behavior. (Tr. \n33-34, 40, 43, 53) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under sexual behavior guideline. The \nGovernment has established a prima facie for disqualification. \nAn individual\u2019s sexual behavior, which includes conduct occurring in person or \nvia audio, visual, electronic, or written transmission, becomes a concerns when it \ninvolves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment; or may subject the individual to \nundue influence of coercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or \nindividually, may raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. (AG \u00b6 12) Applicant \nadmitted to engaging in maladaptive sexual behaviors involving preteen girls. \nSpecifically, he intentionally sought and viewed child pornography between 2008 and \nDecember 2014. He also admitted to masturbating in inappropriate locations while \nwatching or being in proximity preteen girls on at least three occasions between 1995 \nand 2007. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 13(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and, \nAG \u00b6 13(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. \nNone of the sexual behavior mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s statements \nthat OGA misunderstood his disclosures about his viewing child pornography are not \ncredible. There is a rebuttable presumption of good-faith and regularity amongst \ngovernment employees acting in their official capacity. (See ISCR Case No. 97-0184, \nApp. Bd. June 16, 1988) Applicant did not present any evidence that the report \ncontained any errors; only that the information in the OGA report presented him in an \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunfavorable light. Applicant confessed to multiple sexual acts in which preteen girls \nwere the object of his attention, which also lends credibility to his admissions that he \ndeliberately sought and viewed child pornography depicting girls in the same age group. \nThe conclusion in the 2020 psychological evaluation that Applicant does not have \nany current impairment in his judgment or decision-making as it pertains to his work \nresponsibilities, does not assuage the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. The psychologist did not have a chance to review the OGA interview report, \nwhich contains his admissions in an environment where he did not have the opportunity \nto manipulate the outcome. After the first of the January 2015 polygraph examinations, \nApplicant realized that his admissions had and were going to continue to have a \nnegative impact on his ability to maintain a security clearance. In each of his statements \nsince then, he has denied his previously admitted illegal conduct and minimized the \nserious of his other actions. His attempts to minimize the potential concerns are \nhighlighted in the way he completed the GSBI (the sexual behavior inventory) and the \nPAI, the results of which suggested that he may have attempted to manipulate the \nresults. Applicant\u2019s behavior since the January 2015 polygraph examinations confirms \nboth the observations of the polygraph examiner and the evaluating psychologist that \nApplicant has a need to present himself to others in the best possible light. His need to \ndo so prevents mitigation of the alleged security concerns. \nApplicant admitted maladaptive sexual behavior for which he has not sought any \nprofessional help. He has admitted to pattern of behavior, spanning 23 years that shows \na history poor judgment and recklessness. Applicant engaged in sex acts in other \npeople\u2019s homes and while in the same room as his sleeping family. These concerns are \nnot mitigated by the passage of time. He did not present any evidence to suggest that \nhe is not currently engaged in or that he will not engage in similar behavior in the future. \nWhole Person Concept \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s current \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). When considered together, Applicant\u2019s conduct supports a \nnegative whole-person assessment. In the closed environment of the security clearance \nadjudication process, Applicant admitted illegal conduct and other sexual behavior \nrelated to preteen girls. In doing so, he did not eliminate the conduct as a potential \nsource of vulnerability or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s behavior cannot be considered minor \nor inconsequential. The behavior remains a source of shame for him. He has an \nongoing interest in keeping the behavior a secret because disclosure would negatively \naffect his personal and professional standing. None of the favorable character \ninformation in the record outweighs the existing potential for exploitation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Fin dings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Sexual Behavior \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

She neither admitted nor denied the cross-alleged \nallegations under Guideline J, so I find that she has denied those allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for \nher current employer since September 2017. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June \n2017. She has never been married and has no children. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant has two alcohol-related criminal offenses. In March 2018, despite \nknowing that her employer prohibited alcohol consumption during working hours, she \ndrank two mimosas at a restaurant while on her work lunch hour. She then drove back \nto her place of employment. While driving back to work, she was stopped by a police \nofficer, arrested, and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). She spent the night \nin jail. She hired an attorney to help her fight the charges because she thought she had \nbeen treated unfairly by the police officer because he would not verbally divulge her \nblood alcohol content (BAC) level. After requesting an analysis of her blood at a \nhospital, it was determined that her BAC was over the .08 legal limit. She ultimately \npleaded guilty to the charge of Operating a Vehicle with Alcohol Concentration \nEquivalent to at Least .08 but Less than .15. She was sentenced to 60 days in jail with \n56 suspended, 180 days of probation, random drug and alcohol testing, a 60-day \ndriver\u2019s license suspension, and $605 in fines. She completed all of her sentencing \nrequirements. She had not consumed alcohol during work hours before this incident and \nhas not done so since. (Items 1-5) \nPrior to her guilty plea, she underwent an alcohol and drug evaluation from an \nindividual who is a licensed social worker, licensed chemical dependency counselor, \nand certified substance abuse counselor (Clinical Evaluator). The Clinical Evaluator \nreviewed the results of an in-person interview with Applicant, the results of Applicant\u2019s \nSubstance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory, and the Behavior and Attitude Drinking \nand Driving Scale. Based upon these measurement tools, the Clinical Evaluator opined \nthat there is no probability of an alcohol abuse disorder and a low chance of her drinking \nand driving in the future. The Clinical Evaluator recommended that Applicant attend a \n12-hour substance abuse program, which Applicant completed in July 2018. (Items 3, 4) \nDespite knowing that she should tell her employer about her March 2018 arrest, \nApplicant did not do so. Initially, she did not tell her employer because she thought the \ncharges might be dropped. Once she was convicted of the DUI, she did not tell her \nemployer because she forgot. (Item 4) \nIn May 2019, after drinking for several hours at a friend\u2019s house, Applicant drove \nhome despite feeling intoxicated. On her way home, she hit a curb and side-swiped a \ntree, shattering her passenger side window. She resumed driving home because she \nhad not damaged anyone else\u2019s property and her car was still drivable.

She spent two nights in jail. (Items 1-5) \nIn order to attempt to mitigate any potential criminal penalties, she had another \nalcohol evaluation. This alcohol evaluation was completed verbally and the diagnosis is \nunknown. The evaluator recommended that she attend 36 hours of group therapy, \nwhich she completed in August 2019. On January 13, 2020, she pleaded guilty to felony \nDUI. She was sentenced to 730 days of home detention with 545 days suspended and \ntwo-days credit for time served, along with 540 days of probation. She had her driver\u2019s \nlicense suspended and was ordered to pay fines. She completed her probation period in \nDecember 2021, as well as all other requirements of her sentence. Despite knowing \nthat she should tell her employer about her second DUI arrest, she did not do so \nbecause she forgot. She claimed that she will tell her employer about both DUIs. (Items \n1-5) \nAfter her May 2019 DUI, Applicant decided to stop drinking entirely. There is \nevidence that she has abstained from alcohol until at least June 2021 when she \nsubmitted her interrogatory responses. However, there is no evidence that Applicant \nhas continued to abstain from alcohol after June 2021. Applicant was on probation \nwhen she answered those interrogatories. The group therapy she attended in August \n2019 allowed her to more fully understand the negative impact alcohol was having on \nher life and strengthened her resolve to abstain from alcohol in the future. Applicant \nunderstands that she has a problem with alcohol, but believes it is not related to \naddiction. Instead, her issue is that once she begins drinking alcohol, she has a difficult \ntime stopping her consumption until she is extremely intoxicated. She does not attend \nany alcohol counseling or treatment. (Item 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 2018 and 2019. Prior to her 2018 DUI arrest, \nshe had been drinking on her lunch break and was driving back to work. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant has had two DUI arrests since March 2018. Her May 2019 DUI \nresulted in a felony conviction. It has only been about five months since she ended her \ncourt-ordered probation for her second DUI. She stopped drinking once while on \nprobation only to resume drinking and driving just after her first probation ended. While \nshe claimed that she has abstained from alcohol after her May 2019 DUI, she was still \non probation when she provided that information in her June 2021 interrogatory \nresponses. Given that she drank and drove again after her first probation ended and \nthere is no evidence after June 2021 that she is still not drinking, I have doubts about \nher current reliability and judgment and doubts that her behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAs to AG \u00b6 23(b), Applicant is credited with addressing her alcohol issues \nthrough group therapy. However, I have lingering concerns related to Applicant\u2019s \nwillingness to violate the law and place others in danger. She has driven a vehicle after \nconsuming alcohol to excess at least two times, resulting in two DUI convictions. Most \nrecently, in May 2019, she sideswiped a tree, shattering her passenger window, yet \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontinued driving. Applicant\u2019s aforementioned resumption of drinking and driving after \nher first probation, leaves me with doubts regarding whether she has demonstrated a \nclear and established pattern of modified consumption and compliance with the law. AG \n\u00b6 23(b) does not fully apply. In short, given Applicant\u2019s track record, more time is \nneeded for Applicant to demonstrate that she has fully mitigated the security concerns \narising from her alcohol issues. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s two DUIs establish the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not been charged with a crime since May 2019. She has complied \nwith the terms of her probation and made restitution for her criminal activity. However, \nthese facts are insufficient to overcome her two-time DUI history, the last of which \ninvolved a conviction for felony DUI. While AG \u00b6 32(d) partially applies, I have \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunmitigated concerns for the same reasons discussed in my analysis of the alcohol \nconsumption concerns, above. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s failure to inform her employer about her DUIs despite knowing that she \nshould. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

On August 30, 2021, the Government \nindicated it was ready to proceed to a hearing. On September 27, 2021, the case was \nassigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case \nassignment and file on October 6, 2021. \nOn February 22, 2022, I informed Applicant that I was scheduling video conference \nhearings by Microsoft Teams. After some coordination of schedules with the parties, on \nMarch 3, 2022, I scheduled his hearing for April 12, 2022, via Microsoft Teams. \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1-3) and one Applicant exhibit (AE A) \nwere admitted in evidence.

He rented a room in a \nhouse while his spouse and children stayed behind in their home. (GE 1.) \nIn September 2016, Applicant and his spouse purchased a condominium in state X, \nto save on rent while he was working there. (Tr. 40.) Applicant\u2019s spouse stayed behind to \ncare for his elderly aunt, who had some major medical issues. (Tr. 25-26.) In November \n2016, Applicant and his spouse moved his aunt from her state of residence because she \nwas not receiving the care she needed in her state. (Tr. 33-34, 61.) Applicant\u2019s spouse \ncared for his aunt in their home for about one week before moving his aunt into an assisted \nliving facility near her. In early 2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse moved his aunt into another facility \nwhere she was provided more appropriate care. The burden of maintaining, clearing out, \nand then selling his aunt\u2019s house in another state fell on Applicant and his spouse. (Tr. 34.) \nIn January 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse had a medical issue for which she was hospitalized \nfor a few days. (Tr. 26, 38.) Applicant traveled back home from state X to help her. (Tr. 26.) \nIn April 2018, his aunt\u2019s house sold. (Tr. 34.) In June 2018, his aunt was hospitalized for \nover a week, and Applicant\u2019s spouse had to deal with palliative care and hospice care \nproviders for his aunt. Applicant\u2019s spouse spent on average two to three hours per day with \nhis aunt from 2017 until July 2019, when she died. (Tr. 35-36.) \nApplicant handled their taxes in that he gathered the information needed to file their \ntax returns for their certified public accountant (CPA), who had been preparing their tax \nreturns since around 2012. Some documents needed to file their tax returns went to \nApplicant in state X and other documents went to their marital residence. (Tr. 30-31.) It \nbecame an issue getting the documentation to their CPA in a timely fashion. (Tr. 31.) \nApplicant came home approximately one weekend per month. On some of the trips, when \nhe had time available, he would look through some of his paperwork, but it was \u201ca real \nchallenge.\u201d (Tr. 37, 69.) He filed their tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 late. He \nrecalls it was in either 2018 or 2019. (Tr. 70.) He indicated on a June 19, 2020 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he filed his income tax returns \nand paid his taxes late for tax years 2015 and 2016, but the issues were resolved in \nNovember 2018.

(Tr. 39.) \nInitially, Applicant worked full time in state X, but after several budget cuts, his hours \nwere reduced to four days a week. After a significant reduction in program funding in 2019, \nhe was laid off in April 2019. He received a severance package and collected \nunemployment compensation. The tax deadline for filing his and his spouse\u2019s joint tax \nreturns for 2018 passed without their federal and state X income tax returns being filed. \n(Tr. 39.) In June 2019, Applicant moved back home. He began working for his current \nemployer on a U.S. military installation in state Y in July 2019. (GE 1.) His first priority was \nhis job (Tr. 71), and he did not file a tax return with the IRS or with states X and Y for tax \nyear 2019 by the tax deadlines for those returns. (Tr. 32.) A trip planned for March 2020 to \nsell their condominium in state X was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. \n40.) At the start of the pandemic, they apologized to their CPA for not getting tax \ndocuments to her that they needed to file their tax returns, although the CPA largely left it \nto them to contact her. (Tr. 43-44.) Applicant did not think of submitting the documentation \nhe had at the time to the CPA as he wanted to have all the information needed for his \nreturns before contacting the CPA. (Tr. 73.) \nOn his June 2020 SF 86, Applicant stated that he and his spouse were \u201clate\u201d in \nsubmitting their federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018 because \nof him commuting between his home and state X on a monthly basis to see his spouse and \nhelp her care for his ailing aunt in an assisted living facility. Also, he had not kept his \npaperwork and computer files organized nor allocated the time. He added that he was \nworking with a tax preparer to get his taxes filed for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019, but \nthat taxes were withheld from his income. He disclosed that he had filed his returns and \npaid his taxes late for tax years 2015 and 2016, and he received refunds of $4,176 in \nfederal income taxes and $3,784 from state X for tax year 2015. For 2016, he paid $4,339 \nto the IRS \u201cshortly after 19 Nov. 2019,\u201d and he received a $4,648 refund from state X. He \ndid not know what he owed, if anything, to the IRS or state X for tax years 2017 and 2018. \n(GE 1.) \nApplicant was interviewed by telephone by an authorized investigator for the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) on August 5, 2020. Applicant admitted that he had not \nyet filed his federal or state X income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018. He added \nthat he would contact the IRS within the next few days to resolve the matters and pay any \ntaxes owed. He explained that he had not filed his returns or paid his taxes on time due to \na family member\u2019s ill heath and having caregiver duties for this person. He also stated that \nhe was not able to attend to these financial matters while living in state X away from his \nwife. (GE 2.) \nAt the request of the DCSA CAF, Applicant on February 8, 2021, provided IRS \naccount transcripts for 2017 and 2018 and state X wage and withholding information for tax \nyears 2015 through 2019.

The account transcript for 2018 likewise showed \nno return had been filed by January 5, 2021.

Reported wage income was $125,542, \nand retirement income was $10,788. He also received a gross distribution of $9,000 from \nretirement accounts. State X wages and withholding details showed he had income taxes \nwithheld each year from his income, but not whether his and his spouse\u2019s joint returns had \nbeen filed. (GE 2.) Recently prepared and filed state X tax return for 2017 shows that they \nwere refunded $4,648 in state X taxes for 2016. (AE C.) \nIn a detailed response of February 8, 2021, to DCSA CAF interrogatories, Applicant \nexpressed deep regret for not filing his tax returns on time and for failing to request \nextensions of the tax-filing deadlines. He cited primarily three circumstances since 2012 or \n2013, which \u201cdepleted the time [he and his spouse] could have spent keeping [their] lives, \n[their] files of paperwork and [their] house much less cluttered and better organized.\u201d  \nChiefly, he blamed \u201call the time, worry, and effort\u201d involved in caring for his ailing aunt, his \nacceptance of a position in state X, and the consequent \u201cdegradation\u201d in their ability to \nkeep their paperwork and home organized. He and his spouse had to interview potential \ncaretakers for 24-hour care for his aunt in her home, arrange for her financial affairs, and \nmeet with her attorneys. When her health deteriorated to where she could no longer be \ncared for safely in her home, they moved his aunt into an assisted living facility in state Y in \n2016. However, after only a short time there, they had to move her to another facility that \ncould better care for her. He added that much of the responsibility for his aunt\u2019s medical \n(finding doctors, arranging for transportation to medical visits and procuring prescriptions) \nand legal needs (updating his aunt\u2019s will, revising her trust, handling her finances) fell to his \nspouse, until his spouse was hospitalized. After his aunt died in early July 2019, Applicant \nserved as executor of her will and trust. (GE 3.) \nConcerning his job search\u2019s impact, Applicant explained that he had no success \nfrom mid-2014 to mid-2015 because of a tight job market. He accepted a position in state X \naround July 2015 because the work was challenging and he respected his co-workers from \nprior interactions with them, knowing that it would strain his and his spouse\u2019s ability to \nremain organized. He cited his commute back home every three or four weeks, and the \ntime-consuming purchase of a condominium after one year of paying rent. He was able to \nget caught up on his returns and tax payments for 2015 and 2016 but then had to look for \nanother position when funding decreased for the program he was working on. Only a few \nmonths after his layoff in April 2019, he was able to secure his present employment, but he \nhad to ship his belongings back home. He stated that with the assistance of a professional \ntax preparer, he would file his 2017 and 2018 tax returns and then complete the filing of his \n2019 and 2020 tax returns by the end of 2021. (GE 3.) \nIn August 2021, Applicant and his spouse traveled to state X to clean out their \ncondominium and list it for sale. (Tr. 40.) The condominium sold in October 2021.

They rented a storage shed near their home to store boxes of \ndocuments after they had sorted through them. It gave them space to get their taxes and \nother important paperwork organized. (Tr. 63.) \nStarting in January 2022, Applicant began a concerted effort, in piecemeal fashion, \nto compile and give their CPA the documents needed to file his and his spouse\u2019s \ndelinquent federal, state X, and state Y tax returns. (Tr. 43.) On March 2, 2022, the CPA \nfinished preparing, and Applicant submitted his and his spouse\u2019s joint federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2017 through 2020 and their state X income tax returns for tax years \n2017 through 2019. (AEs C-F.) On March 24, 2022, the CPA finished preparing Applicant\u2019s \nand his spouse\u2019s joint state Y income tax return for tax year 2019. On March 25, 2022, the \nCPA finished their state Y income tax return for tax year 2020, and Applicant mailed the tax \nreturns for 2019 and 2020 to state Y. (AEs E-F.) Applicant paid the taxes owed when they \nsubmitted their tax returns. He filed for an extension of the tax-filing deadline for tax year \n2021.

(Tr. 12.) He also learned over the last year that the IRS had a lot of their tax \ninformation that he could have accessed to get their delinquent tax returns filed. (Tr. 62, \n68.) He was aware from completing security clearance applications in the past that not \nfiling tax returns could be of concern to the DOD. (Tr. 66.)

And it wasn\u2019t at the bottom of the list, but it fell below \nwhat it, what I felt I was able to do without overstressing myself or my wife. \n(Tr. 67.) \nApplicant and his spouse always intended to pay the taxes owed. He made sure that \ntheir bills were paid, including on the condominium in state X, but the burden of gathering \nthe information needed to file their tax returns was \u201canother level of difficulty up from that.\u201d \n(Tr. 67-68.) \nAs of July 2020, Applicant\u2019s gross salary was $137,508 annually. (GE 2.) He works \non a contract that provides engineering support to the United States Air Force. He highly \nvalues the technical work that he does for the U.S. government and does not want to lose \nthe opportunity to \u201cdo more good for the U.S. government.\u201d (AE A.) He is remorseful and \nembarrassed about his failure to file his tax returns on time. (Tr. 73-74.) \nThe chief engineer to whom Applicant reported from about July 2019 until February \n2021 indicated that Applicant\u2019s performance in 2019 \u201cdemonstrably led\u201d to the project team \nreceiving a prestigious small team of the year award.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant admits that he and his spouse did not file their federal and state income \ntax returns when they were due for tax years 2015 through 2020. Section 6012 of Title 26 \nof the United States Code requires the filing of an income tax return by spouses filing jointly \nif their gross incomes together exceed twice the sum of the exemption amount plus the \nbasis standard deduction applicable to a joint return. If their income met the threshold for \nfiling, Applicant and his spouse were required to file tax returns by the deadlines, whether \nor not they expected tax refunds. Applicant\u2019s income exceeded the filing threshold for each \nof the tax years alleged. There was no intent to evade paying taxes, although the recently \nfiled tax returns show that they underpaid their federal income taxes for tax years 2017 \nthrough 2020. Guideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not \ncomply with his or her tax-filing obligations, whether or not any taxes are owed. AG \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his noncompliance with such an \nimportant obligation as filing his tax returns on time. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, given Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with his \nincome tax filing obligations for several consecutive years. While he rectified his tax issues \nfor 2015 and 2016 by November 2019, well before the SOR was issued, his failure to file \nhis federal and state income tax returns on time for tax years 2017 through 2020 \nundermines his case in reform. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant and his spouse had significant obligations caring \nfor his elderly aunt between 2012 and July 2019, which provide some mitigation in this \ncase. Applicant and his spouse had to interview caregivers for his aunt when she lived in \nher own home in another state. Applicant arranged for his aunt\u2019s financial affairs. When his \naunt\u2019s health deteriorated to where she could no longer be safely cared for in her house, \nApplicant and his spouse moved her into an assisted living facility near them in November \n2016. With Applicant working in state X, the burden of clearing out his aunt\u2019s home largely \nfell to his spouse. The primary responsibility for his aunt\u2019s medical needs (finding doctors, \narranging for transportation to medical visits and procuring prescriptions) was also borne by \nhis spouse, who had medical issues of her own in January 2018. Applicant had always \nbeen responsible for compiling their tax information for his CPA, so other than the possible \nimpact of having some tax papers at home and some in state X, it is difficult to see where \nhis duties for his aunt precluded him from compiling his tax paperwork for his and his \nspouse\u2019s CPA. After his aunt died in July 2019, Applicant served as executor of her will and \ntrust, but he did not explain how that caused years of inattention to his tax issues. The \nCOVID pandemic led Applicant and his spouse to cancel a March 2020 trip to their \ncondominium in state X, where Applicant had left some of his tax paperwork, but he did not \nprovide any details as to which tax years. \nThe considerable delay in Applicant addressing his delinquent tax filings was not \nentirely due to circumstances outside of his control. Applicant was disorganized in his \npaperwork and did not make filing his delinquent returns a priority. After his aunt died, and \nhe began working for his current employer, he focused on his work. A year into his new job, \nhe completed his SF 86. He candidly disclosed that he had not filed his income tax returns \nfor tax years 2017 and 2018. During his August 2020 interview with an OPM investigator, \nApplicant stated that he would contact the IRS within the next few days to resolve his tax \nfilings and pay any taxes owed. Despite receiving inquiries from the IRS in December 2018 \nabout his unfiled tax return for tax year 2017 and in March 2020 for tax year 2018; \ninterrogatories about his unfiled returns from the DCSA CAF in early 2021; and the SOR in \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJune 2021, he had not filed his delinquent income tax returns for tax years 2017 through \n2020 by the end of 2021. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant\u2019s very belated filing of his delinquent federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2017 through 2020, and his payment of federal income taxes owed, \nimplicates AG \u00b6 20(c) and AG \u00b6 20(g). Yet, the Appeal Board has reaffirmed that the timing \nof corrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax \nissues by DOHA judges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who \nonly begin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that \ntheir clearance may be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when \ntheir immediate interests are not imperiled. \nApplicant is remorseful and embarrassed by his failure to comply with his known \nlegal obligation to file his income tax returns by the filing deadlines. He has taken some \nsteps, such as obtaining a storage shed, which he asserts will help him become more \norganized with his paperwork so that he can file his tax returns on time in the future. A \npromise of future compliance is not a substitute for a track record of filing returns on time. \nHis lack of urgency in addressing his tax issues is incompatible with the judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness expected of him, based on his education and experience \nwith the clearance process. The financial considerations security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s repeated and recent failure to comply with his tax-filing obligations are not fully \nmitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant\u2019s contributions to the Air Force are unassailable and merit considerable \nrespect. Nonetheless, the Appeal Board has made clear that voluntary compliance with \nsuch rules and systems as those pertaining to filing returns and paying taxes is essential \nfor protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMar. 25, 2016). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based \non the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nto grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant did not file the tax returns for the earlier years \nbecause he was told to only go back six years. Information from the tax professional \nindicates that Applicant would have been due refunds for 2015 ($306-IRS and $1,326-\nstate); 2016 ($1,366-IRS and $1,635-state); 2018 ($1,135-IRS and $1,726-state); and \n2020 ($2,649-IRS and $1,877-state).

(Tr. at 16-19, 24, 27-30; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, B) \nApplicant submitted documentation that he paid the IRS $1,227 (tax year 2017) \nand $390 (2019) in October 2021. That same month, he received refunds of $831 and \n$2,649 from the IRS; and 1,573, $1,726, and $1,877 from the state. He paid the IRS \n$2,590 and $2,983 in June 2022.

His finances are otherwise in good shape, with \nmore than $800,000 in investments and retirement accounts and no delinquent debts. \n(Tr. at 26-27; GE 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file his 2006 through 2019 federal and state income tax returns \nwhen they were due. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant was named his father\u2019s executor after he passed away in late 2006. He \nworked long hours and put off filing the returns. He also admitted that he did not file the \nreturns because of laziness and procrastination. \nApplicant knew that his unfiled returns were an issue when he submitted his SF \n86 in March 2019; when he was interviewed in May 2019 and stated that the returns \nwould be filed by December 31, 2019; and when he responded to interrogatories in \nJanuary 2021. He did not file the returns until after he received the SOR. I believe \nApplicant likely lost more money in forfeited refunds than he owed. But we will never \nknow for certain because the returns from 2006 through 2014 have never been filed. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed income tax returns, but that does not end the \ndiscussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed. \nThe timing of ameliorative action is a factor that should be brought to bear in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file income tax returns for more than a \ndecade continues to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability and willingness to follow \nrules and regulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns is insufficient to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \novercome the many years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to this country to file \nhis tax returns. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on September 2, 2021, \nand he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a manager with his current employer since January 2011. He previously worked for \nanother employer as a lead mechanic (May 2004 \u2013 January 2011).

He was married in 2001. He has two children, \nborn in 2002 and 2006. \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant self-reported a number of federal income tax issues on his SF 86. He \nacknowledged that he had failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2011, \n2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. In addition, he had failed to pay federal income taxes \nfor those years which he estimated to total $10,000.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2011, \n2012, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018, and he failed to pay his federal income taxes \nfor 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2019. In some cases, the federal income tax returns \nwere not filed until several years later, well after the required filing dates. He admitted that \nhe did not file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns until May 31, 2021, after the \nSOR was issued. A tax lien was filed against his assets in 2015 for the delinquent 2011 \nincome tax. His adjusted gross income in 2019 was $146,326, but he submitted few \nverified efforts other than the initiation of periodic installment agreements that were later \ncancelled to resolve his federal income tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b619(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) \nhave been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) minimally apply. A debt that became delinquent several \nyears ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The \nnature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s delayed failure to voluntarily and timely \nresolve his delinquent federal income tax issues for several years, despite repeated \npromises to do so, make it rather easy to conclude that they were not infrequent. This \ncase involves two separate issues: the failure to timely file federal income tax returns, \nand the failure to pay federal income taxes. Furthermore, considering his continued \nfailures and delayed actions in addressing both issues despite earning a rather healthy \nwage, his federal income tax issues are likely to remain unchanged in the future. Applicant \nattributed his financial issues essentially to a combination of procrastination and moving \naround a lot which caused him to misplace the majority of his paperwork. He indicated \nthat his wife handles all the family finances, and she had never mentioned any issues \nregarding their accounts. However, he obviously learned about some of the tax issues \nbefore he completed his SF 86. Nevertheless, additional issues arose after he submitted \nthe SF 86. Applicant\u2019s failure to more timely address his federal income tax issues leads \nto a conclusion that his actions or inaction were irresponsible. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The \nSOR was issued in May 2021; and the FORM was issued in September 2021. Each step \nof the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the \nfinancial issues confronting him. With respect to his unfiled federal income tax returns, he \nfiled the 2011 income tax return in 2013; and the 2012, 2013, and 2014 income tax returns \nin 2016, before the security eligibility process commenced. However, the 2016, 2017, and \n2018 income tax returns were not filed until 2019 and 2020 \u2013 well after the process began. \nIt is difficult to understand how he could fail to focus on his 2018 income tax return when \nhe was already in the security eligibility process. By failing to be aware of the status of his \nfederal income tax return filings and non-payments over such a lengthy multi-year period, \nApplicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required \nof those granted access to classified information. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

Aug. 18, 2015). \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.

An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, there are some promises, but \nno actual resolution efforts. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. It remains difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nmanager with his current employer since January 2011. He previously worked for another \nemployer as a lead mechanic (May 2004 \u2013 January 2011). He is a 1994 high school \ngraduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in November 1994, and served on active duty until \nApril 1998. He has held a secret clearance since 1994. Applicant candidly acknowledged \nin his SF 86 that he had some continuing federal income tax issues. He eventually filed \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nall of his delinquent his federal income tax returns and has made payments for some of \nhis delinquent taxes. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns and make income \ntax payments for multiple tax years. Although he was eventually aware of the non-filings \nand non-payments in 2018, some of those issues were not resolved and subsequent \nidentical issues arose. His 2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns were not filed until \nDecember 2019; and his 2018 federal income tax return was not filed until 2020. For \nunexplained reasons, while he still owes the IRS unpaid income taxes for several years, \nthe accounts were \u201ccurrently considered collectable\u201d was zero. Applicant was \nadministratively discharged from active duty with a general discharge. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \namended, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Item 4) He indicated he started using \nmarijuana in high school in 2015, because of peer pressure. He clarified that he resumed \nhis marijuana use during his sophomore year in college in 2018. He purchased marijuana \nwhen he turned 21 in June 2019. He claimed that his most recent uses of marijuana were \nin September and December 2020. \nApplicant acknowledged knowing that marijuana is illegal under both his state and \nfederal law.

When asked about his current and future use of \nmarijuana, he stated that he did not believe he is addicted to marijuana, but intended to \nkeep on using his tincture until it runs out. \nApplicant has been tested for drug use by his employer at least twice since he was \nhired in July 2020. He stated he is not concerned about testing positive because his use \nis infrequent, only once every few months. Initially, he claimed not to know whether his \nemployer has a policy against the use of illegal drugs, but believes that if he tested \npositive there would be a problem. \nWhen asked whether he would continue his illegal marijuana use knowing it is \nillegal under both state and federal law, and knowing his employer has a policy against it, \nApplicant stated he would not use marijuana in the future and that he would probably \nthrow his tincture away. He does not want to risk losing his clearance eligibility over his \nuse of marijuana. He noted that his friends and some coworkers know about his marijuana \nuse. He is not concerned about being blackmailed because his use is infrequent. \nIn his April 2021 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that he \ndecided to stop using marijuana in December 2020 because he wanted to get a \nclearance. He stated twice that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. The last \ntime he purchased marijuana was roughly one year and nine months prior to his answer \nto the interrogatories. He claimed that he no longer hangs out with anyone that does drugs \noften. He presented no documentary evidence to show that he sought or received any \nmedical or psychological treatment or counseling for substance abuse. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own.

Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence Memorandum \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, made it clear that state laws do \nnot authorize citizens to violate federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug.  \nChanges to state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. An individual's disregard \nof federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises questions about the \nindividual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, \nrules, and regulations, including federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, 50 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 3343 (2008), specifically prohibits a federal agency from granting or renewing a \nclearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict, and under federal \nlaw, use of marijuana remains unlawful.

It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s behavior \nraises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, from about 2015 to December \n2020. He used marijuana after he started working for his employer as an intern in June \n2019, after he was hired as a permanent employee in July 2020, and after he was tested \nat least twice for the use of illegal drugs. He used marijuana one-month before he \nsubmitted his October 2020 SCA, and he used marijuana in December 2020 after he \nsubmitted his October 2020 SCA. \nApplicant told a government investigator during a 2021 interview, that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. He acknowledged knowing that the use of marijuana \nwas illegal under federal and state law, and that his employer has a policy against \nemployees using illegal drugs. At the time of the interview, he was still in possession of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfour or five doses of marijuana tincture.

An evaluation of \napplicable mitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant has a history of illegal marijuana possession and use between 2015 and \nDecember 2020. He knew that the use of marijuana is illegal under both his state and \nfederal law, and that his employer has a policy against employees using illegal drugs. He \nillegally used marijuana between June 2019 and December 2020, after he was tested for \ndrug use by his employer, and after he was hired and applied for a clearance in October \n2020. Applicant\u2019s evidence is inconclusive as to whether he has disassociated from his \nmarijuana-using friends and coworkers. \nApplicant claimed he had not used marijuana after December 2020, and promised \nnot to use marijuana in the future. However, considering his past criminal behavior, the \npassage of time so far is insufficient to establish that his use of marijuana is unlikely to \nrecur. He was aware of his state and the Federal laws, and his employer\u2019s policy against \nillegal drug use, and the adverse security consequences for such use. Nevertheless, he \nwas unwilling to stop using marijuana after he submitted his October 2020 SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of marijuana casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. His suitability to hold a clearance is questionable, especially because his \nsubstance misuse occurred after applying for a clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H \nin my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has been working \nfor his employer since July 2020. He illegally used marijuana between 2015 and \nDecember 2020. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with federal \nrules and regulations continue to raise serious questions about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Considering the \nrecord as a whole, the passage of time since his most recent marijuana use so far is \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \ninsufficient to establish that his use of marijuana is unlikely to recur. The drug involvement \nand substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.
