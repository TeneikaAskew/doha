Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on June 15,\n2006. On October 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 24, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on October 26, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 13, 2007. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on November 28, 2007, and I received the case\nassignment on December 13, 2007, after it was transferred from another administrative\njudge because of caseload. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 17, 2007,\nFebruary 12, 2008\n\n2\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 8, 2008.  The government offered\nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf and offered no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non January 25, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 26, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c to1.e of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e of the SOR. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant is 28 years old, divorced, with one child from his present relationship.\nHe works for a defense contractor as an engineering technician.  He has an associate\u2019s\ndegree, obtained in May 2003.  He started work at his current job in May 2005.\nPreviously, he had employment with several local companies. He is the sole support of\nhis family. (Tr. 13, 16, 27; Exhibit 1)\nApplicant has six delinquent debts, totaling about $30,000.  He is currently\npaying $18,000 in federal insured student loans, which he revived from default status in\n2007.  Applicant made a down payment using part of his last year\u2019s income tax refund.\nHe made payments for one year at $150 monthly.  The lender then considered the\nloans rehabilitated, and lowered the payments to $125 monthly.  Applicant continues to\nmake those payments intending to repay the loans in full. (Tr. 8, 22, 23, 30; Exhibits 1-\n4)\nApplicant owes $318 on a medical bill for treatment of a work-related injury in\n2000 (SOR Subparagraph 1.a).  He did not have medical insurance and eventually\nrealized he had to pay for the emergency room treatment.  Applicant intends to repay\nthis debt in 2008 from his 2007 income tax refund. (Tr. 19, 20, 33, 38; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant owes $360 on a lease for a former apartment (SOR Subparagraph\n1.b).  He lived there two years, never had a written lease, and moved with giving only\ntwo weeks notice.  The landlord retained his deposit and seeks the balance of the last\nmonth\u2019s rent of $360.  Applicant disputes owing the debt because he does not think he\nhad to give 30 days notice without a written lease being in effect.  Applicant intends to\npay this debt from his income tax refund. This debt occurred in October 2006. (Tr. 20,\n33; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant owes $215 for a medical bill (SOR Subparagraph 1.c).  This debt dates\nfrom 2000.  Applicant is not certain the basis for this debt.  However, he intends to\nrepay it from his income refund received this year. (Tr. 21, 33; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant has two student loans on which he is not currently paying because he\ndoes not have sufficient income to do so.  They are private student loans (SOR\n\n3\nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e), totaling about $17,000.  Applicant had insufficient income\nbefore obtaining his current job to repay all the student loans, both the federal and\nprivate student loans.  Now, he intends to use a substantial portion of his income tax\nrefund to make a down payment on these private loans, and enter a repayment\ninstallment plan.  He intends to repay all his debts as quickly as he is financially able to\ndo so. He contacted the lender last year about arranging repayment plan, but the lender\nwould not negotiate a plan with him.  Applicant intends to keep trying to negotiate a\nrepayment plan. (Tr. 22-25, 29, 33, 38, 39, 46; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant\u2019s last delinquent debt is $13,036 for a car repossessed in 2000.\nApplicant bought the car after graduating from high school.  He could pay the $300\nmonthly loan payments, but the additional insurance monthly payments of $225 were\nmore than he could afford at his previous income level.  After a year of making\npayments, he surrendered the car, which was later sold., Applicant asked for, but never\nreceived an accounting of the amount for which the car sold.  Applicant disputes the\namount sought by the creditor because he has not been given the sale amount.  He\nwould like to establish a reasonable amount for repayment on this debt, and then enter\nan installment payment plan with that creditor. (Tr. 14-19, 40; Exhibits 2-4)\nApplicant has two credit cards, with balances of $170 and $200.  He pays those\ncredit card debts regularly.  He also pays his monthly expenses on time. (Tr. 28, 37)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay\nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence\nshows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n\n5\nresolve debts.@ Applicant rehabilitated on his own initiative the federal-insured student\nloans.  He has faithfully paid that debt for over one year.  He has a plan to repay the\nprivately issued student loans, though his income will necessitate a long repayment time\nperiod.  Applicant is the sole support of his family, and pays his monthly bills on time.\nThe listed debts date from four to seven years ago, with only one debt dating from 2006.\nApplicant has not incurred additional delinquent debt during this time period.  He also\nintends to repay the first three debts listed in the SOR from his tax refund this year.  His\ntestimony appeared sincere.  I conclude he is credible in his explanations of his financial\nhistory and his plans to repay the debts.  Additionally, AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) applies because Applicant intends to\nrepay the two debts he denied and disputed. The credit reports show he disputed the\nauto repossession debt, and he denied the lease debt in his SOR answer.  Based on\nthe totality of the evidence, I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a young man. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He accumulated debt due to a desire\nto obtain an education and to better himself.  He accomplished that goal, but the debt\nremains. (See AG & 2(a)(2).)  Most significantly, he has taken affirmative action to pay\nor resolve the larger of the two student debts raising security concerns. (See AG &\n2(a)(6).  He took the initiative in 2006 to start that process. Thus, this debt cannot be a\nsource of improper pressure or duress. \nApplicant intends to pay his other debts.  His sincerity and credibility, coupled\nwith his performance on the student debt, persuade me that he will accomplish that goal\nalso. He has legitimate reasons to dispute the amount of money demanded by the\ncreditor for his repossessed car. He attempted to contact that creditor, along with the\nprivate student loan creditor, to arrange reasonable installment repayment plans. To\n\n6\ndate, he has not received favorable responses. But he stated he would continue the\neffort.  His tax refund this year will enable him to repay the first three debts listed in the\nSOR, showing again his good-faith efforts within his financial abilities to repay his debts.\nIt is also significant that he does not have a succession of delinquent debts incurred\nafter the completion of his education.  He is managing his money and monthly expenses\nresponsibly.   \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid B it is whether\nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.\nWhile some debts remain unpaid, they are part of Applicant\u2019s plan to repay them, and\nso do not raise security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).  Applicant is credible, informed\nabout his debts, and acting responsibly.  He presented his case in a diligent and\norganized manner, demonstrating his commitment to repaying his debts.  He testified\nforthrightly, and did not attempt to obfuscate or mislead.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nPHILIP S. HOWE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After working his entire life,\nhe retired in 2005. As a result of helping two family members by co-signing auto loans, he petitioned\nfor a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April and a Chapter 13 in October 1997. He paid his creditors and\nresolved the debt. In May 2007, Applicant entered into a Chapter 13 plan in May 2007. Applicant\nis paying his creditors under that plan. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations\nconcern at this time.  Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated November 22, 2006).\n2\nId.\n3\nGE 2 and 3 (Bankruptcy Petitions).\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On October 10, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on\nOctober 27, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on November 16, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for December 11, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 11, 2007, to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-9) were admitted. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on December 19, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegations under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.h set forth in the\nSOR pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F. Those admissions are incorporated\nas findings of fact.  He denied allegations 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j.  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional finding of fact:\nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He has been with his current\nemployer working as a janitor since 2006. He completed a security clearance application on\nNovember 22, 2006.2\nApplicant married in 1969 and was divorced shortly thereafter in December 1969. He has no\nchildren.

Prior to 1997, Applicant had no financial difficulties and paid his accounts\nand bills.  \n4\n\nId.\n5\nTr. 29.\n6\nGE 5 (Bankruptcy Petition).\n7\nGE 6 (Response to interrogatories, dated 2007).\n8\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n9\nId. at 527.\n10\n3\nAlthough divorced for many years, Applicant and his ex-wife remained friends. In October\nof 1997, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy because his ex-wife had an automobile accident\nand the car loan was co-signed by Applicant. He paid under that plan until June 1999. He requested\na dismissal from the court so that he could pay all the creditors. He then refinanced his house that\nyear and used the proceeds to pay those debts.5\nIn 2000, Applicant had a short period of unemployment. He was working as a welder for a\nlong while. However, the company needed his services as a utility worker. He continued to work\nuntil 2005 when he retired.\nIn 2006, Applicant moved from his hometown to a warmer climate. However, he could not\nsell his house at the time. He left the state and defaulted on his mortgage.  The home mortgage\n6\nbalance was $85,200. The company initiated foreclosure proceedings for that amount. He also owned\ntwo vehicles. He left one vehicle behind in his home state. He did not like driving that one any more\nbecause he had difficulty getting out of the vehicle. The debt from the auto repossession is $11,000.\nApplicant denied the other debts, including cable ($411), and direct tv ($348) because he\nnever signed up for direct tv. He also disputed the telephone bill ($3,384). When he filed for chapter\n13 bankruptcy, he included those debts in the 2007 plan.7\nApplicant now works as a janitor for a defense contractor. He does not believe he needs a\nsecurity clearance for his work.  He earns approximately $2,021 net a month and has expenses of\n$1,682. He has a net remainder of $339 at the end of the month. Under his 2007 Chapter 13\nbankruptcy plan, his monthly payment is $325 a month. Since July 2007, Applicant has been paying\nunder the plan. He is current on his rent and daily expenses. He received some financial counseling\nas part of his bankruptcy proceedings.8\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n9\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n10\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\n\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n11\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n12\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n13\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n14\nAG 18.\n15\n4\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n11\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n12\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n13\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n14\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n15\nApplicant admitted filing for bankruptcy twice in 1997 and again in 2007. His credit report\nconfirmed his debts. Thus, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply.\n\n5\nApplicant admitted that he co-signed two auto loans for different family members, and that\nas a result he had financial difficulties.  He exercised poor judgment by co-signing loans for the\nbenefit of others to his financial detriment. FC DC 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means,\nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ration, and/or other financial analysis) applies.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20 (a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s 2007 bankruptcy casts doubt on his financial judgment.  I find that FC\nMC 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s home foreclosure due to his inability to sell his house in 2006, and his 1997\nbankruptcy due to helping family members, merits partial mitigation under FC MC 20(b). However,\nthere is no evidence that he contacted his creditor or sought credit counseling before he left his home\nin 2006 to establish the type of evidence necessary for the second prong of mitigation under 20(b).\nApplicant received counseling as part of his 2007 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He no\nlonger has any delinquent debts due to the counseling and his 2007 payment plan.  FC MC 20(c)\napplies in this case. \nFC MC 20(d) is applicable because Applicant used  bankruptcy to resolve his debts.  This\nwas a legal and good faith effort on his part to pay the debts alleged in the SOR.\nApplicant denied or disputed several debts listed in the SOR, but he included those debts in\nhis payment plan. He did not provide documentation to substantiate the basis of his dispute. FC MC\n20(e) does not apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant is an earnest, mature gentleman who has worked his entire life. Prior to 1997, he\nhad no financial difficulties. He helped family members by co-signing auto loans which led him to\n\n6\nfinancial difficulties that resulted in bankruptcy in 1997. He admits poor judgment in this issue.\nHowever, in 2006, he decided to move to a warmer climate. He left his home and one vehicle behind\nand as a result defaulted on his home mortgage and his car was repossessed. This was not a\nresponsible way to handle the situation, and again demonstrated poor judgment. Although, he used\na legal means to resolve his debt in 2007, it is not sufficient to establish a sound track record of\nfinancial responsibility given his previous history. It is not clearly consistent with the national\nsecurity to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nbased on his financial issues. He is not eligible for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:\n            \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance\nis denied.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 15, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nF. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 4, 2008, and requested an administrative\ndetermination. On March 25, 2008, the government prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterials (FORM), and provided it to Applicant for a reply if he so wished. Applicant did\nnot reply. The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the\nFORM, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nJuly 31, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is a 45-year-old married man\nwith two children, ages 17 and 14. He earned a bachelor of science degree in 1984, and\nworks for a contractor as a flight test engineer.\nApplicant has six delinquent debts (SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f) totalling\napproximately $13,000. SOR subparagraph 1.a is a utility bill, SOR subparagraph 1.c is\na credit card account, and SOR subparagraph 1.f is a mortgage on a home purchased\nin 2000 (Item 11 at 5). There is no record evidence identifying the nature of the\nremaining SOR delinquencies.\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to poor financial management, and his\nwife\u2019s loss of income resulting from back surgery (Item 6 at 2). Also, he overextended\nhis finances on the 2000 home purchase, and he cannot balance its mortgage\npayments with his other living expenses (Id.). \nApplicant has paid some of his debts sporadically over the past two years (Item 6\nat 7 through 14). In January 2008, he was charged for overdrawing his bank account\nmore than 15 times (Item 7 at 26). Some time that month, he retained a financial advisor\n(Id. at 36). With the assistance of the counselor, he prepared a budget that lists all of his\ndebts and his expenses (Id. at 36 through 40) It does not include a debt payment plan.\nSince February 2008, Applicant has been attempting to sell his home (Item 8).\nCurrently, he is \u201centertaining a contract on the property in the amount of $130,000\n(Answer; Settlement Statement, as listed in Item 7 at 17.). He anticipates that the sale\nof the property will generate income to satisfy his remaining debts. He owes\napproximately $167,000 on the mortgage (Item 6 at 4). \nApplicant has $41,000 in his 401k plan. He has borrowed against this account to\nsatisfy debts in the past. He is precluded from borrowing any further from the account\n(Item 6 at 4). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\n\n3\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Here, Applicant\u2019s financial struggles\ntrigger the application of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG\n& 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent\nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant contends his finances were strained by his wife\u2019s income loss resulting\nfrom a major surgery, but he did not provide any specific details such as when the\nsurgery occurred, and the length of time it disabled his wife. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\ndoes not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s consultation with a financial counselor in January 2008 triggers the\napplication of AG \u00b6 20(c ), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem . . .\u201d Its applicability, however, has limited probative value because he provided\nno evidence of its nature and extent or whether he actually followed the counselor\u2019s\nadvice.\nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies, but has limited probative value.\nAnticipating that the sale of his home will generate income to alleviate his financial\nburden, Applicant has diligently been marketing his home, and a buyer has contracted\nto purchase it. Settlement has not occurred, however. Until the real estate deal is\nfinalized, any profit Applicant may earn is merely speculative. Moreover, a promise to\nsatisfy a debt in the future is not indicative of the reform and rehabilitation required to\n\n4\nmitigate a financial considerations security concern (ISCR Case No. 01-08410 (May 8,\n2002). \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have considered the whole person\nconcept factors in the financial considerations section above, and that analysis does not\nsupport a favorable decision. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His explanation is plausible because the arrest does not show up in his \ncriminal records. (Gov 5; Gov 5.)   \n \nOn July 28, 1987, he was arrested and charged with Telephone \nHarrassment/Threat. (Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 11; Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn June 25, 1988, he was arrested and charged with Assault and Criminal \nTrespass. On December 15, 1988, he was found not guilty.  (Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; \nGov 5 at 2; Gov 10; Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn January 9, 1991, he was arrested and charged with Assault/Family Violence. \n(Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 9; Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn July 20, 1991, he was arrested and charged with Assault/Family Violence, \nand Violation of a Protection Order. The charges were dismissed on September 19, \n1991. (Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; gov 5 at 3; Gov 8; Answer to SOR.)  \n \nOn August 4, 1993, he was arrested and charged with Assault/Family Violence. \n(Gov 3 at 2; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 5; Gov 7; Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn July 12, 1999, he was arrested and charged with Assault/Causing Bodily \nInjury to a Family Member. On January 25, 2000, the charge was dismissed. (Gov 2 at \n7; Gov 4 at 3; Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn May 12, 2003, he was arrested and charged with Aggravated Assault with a \nDeadly Weapon.  Earlier in the evening, Applicant and his family members were \ncelebrating Mother\u2019s Day.  Applicant\u2019s 20-year-old stepson had too much too drink. He \ngot into a fight with Applicant\u2019s son and ran away.  Later in the evening, he returned \nhome and hit Applicant on the head with a nightstick. Applicant hit him back with a \nnightstick to subdue him.  His stepson filed charges. The prosecutor\u2019s office dropped \nthe charges after they interviewed witnesses and learned that Applicant\u2019s stepson had \nattacked him first. (Tr at 24-28; Gov 1; Gov 2 at 3-5; Gov 4 at 4: Answer to SOR.)  \n \nApplicant completed a personnel security questionnaire on November 18, 1994.  \nIn response to question \u201c18(a) Have you ever been arrested, charged, cited, held, or \ndetained by Federal, State, or other law enforcement or juvenile authorities regardless \nof whether the charge was dropped or dismissed or you were found not guilty?\u201d he \nlisted a 1974 charge for possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.n); a 1976 DUI charge (SOR \n\n \n4 \n \n \n\u00b6 1.o); a 1993 family violence charge (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a 1993 public intoxication charge (not \nalleged in the SOR); an 1992 family violence charge (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a 1991 family \nviolence charge (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a 1987 assault charge (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and a 1988 assault by \nthreat charge (SOR \u00b6 1.g). (Gov 6 at 2-3, 5.)  \n \nOn the same questionnaire, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d in response to question \n20(a), which asked \u201cHave you ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include \nheroin or cocaine) depressant (to include Quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen (to \ninclude LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or hashish), or any mind-\naltering substance (to include glue or paint), even one-time or on an experimental basis, \nexcept as prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d  He was subsequently interviewed and \nprovided a signed, sworn statement dated January 30, 1996. In the statement, Applicant \nadmitted that he did not list his past marijuana use which occurred from 1973-1974 on \nhis personnel security questionnaire, dated November 18, 1994. (Gov 3; Gov 6.) He \nstated,  \n \nI did not list the use because it was so long ago and because like anyone I \n \ndid not want to admit that I had done this. I understand that I was omitting \n \npertinent information from my PSQ and that I certified my PSQ, certifying it \n \nwas true, complete and correct. I also realize that having done this I \n \ncause doubt about the information I am now presenting. I assert however \n \nthat I am being forthcoming about my use now and that there is nothing I \n \nneed to add. (Gov 3 at 3.) \n \nApplicant also discussed the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, \n1.i, 1.j, and 1.m in the January 30, 1996, signed, sworn, statement. (Gov 3.) After this \ninterview and the investigation, Applicant was granted a security clearance. (Tr at 36, \n44-45.) \n \nOn January 5, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing. In response to \u201cSection 23(f): Your Police Record. In the last \n7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not \nlisted in response to a, b, c, d, of e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 \nunless the violation was alcohol or drug related.),\u201d he answered, \u201cYes\u201d and listed a May \n2002 arrest for assault. (This is the arrest that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a which actually \noccurred in 2003.) He did not list his July 12, 1999 arrest for assault/causing bodily \ninjury to a family member. Applicant testified that he did not list the July 1999 arrest \nbecause he thought it was more than seven years old. (Tr at 32; Gov 1; Gov 2 at 7; Gov \n4 at 3; Answer to SOR.) Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d in response to question \u201c23d. Have \nyou ever been charged or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d He \nlisted his 1977 arrest for DUI. (Gov 1, section 23.)  \n \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator pursuant to his background \ninvestigation on March 21, 2007.  The purpose of the interview was to discuss his May \n12, 2003 arrest for Aggravated Assault.  No signed, sworn, statement was taken during \nthe interview.  Applicant verified the unsworn summary of the interview as being \n\n \n5 \n \n \naccurate in response to a DOHA interrogatory. (Gov 2) It is alleged that Applicant \nfalsified material facts during this interview by stating that he had no other arrests other \nthan the 2003 arrest for Aggravated Assault. The specific statement in the summary of \nthe interview reads as follows: \n \nThe District Attorney dropped the charge as listed, of aggravated \n \nassault with a deadly weapon, as a result, the subject was never \n \nrequired to appear in court and was assessed no fine or fees. He had \n \nno other problems with his step-son thereafter. He has had no other \n \narrests. (Gov 2 at 4-5.) \n \nApplicant does not recall what the investigator specifically asked him pertaining \nto other arrests.  He believed that he had to discuss arrests within the past seven years.  \nNone of his previous arrests occurred within seven years at the time of the interview. (Tr \nat 29-33.) The investigator did not testify. One could interpret the statement to mean \nthat Applicant had no arrests since the 2003 incident which would be an accurate \nstatement.  \n \nOn April 10, 2007, Applicant was interviewed again. During this interview, he \ndiscussed the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.m, and 1.n.  The summary of the \ninterview states at the end, \u201cThe Subject had no other arrests in his background.\u201d (Gov \n2 at 6-10.) It is alleged Applicant falsified material facts by stating he had no other \narrests in his background. At hearing, Applicant testified that to the best of his \nknowledge, during the interview, he had no other arrests.  He remarked that he should \nhave gotten a copy of his arrest record so that he could have been more precise. He \nwas answering the question based on memory. (Tr at 32-36.)     \n \nAn FBI Identification Record dated October 27, 2005, states that Applicant has \nseveral aliases. (Gov 4.) One of the aliases listed was Applicant\u2019s nickname in college. \nAnother alias was his mother\u2019s maiden name. He has never used his mother\u2019s maiden \nname or his nickname when signing legal documents. He has never used an alias in \nfurtherance of an illegal activity. (Tr at 41-43.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance reports for 2005, 2006, and 2007, rate him as either \nmeeting or exceeding his performance requirements. (AE C.) His 2007 performance \nreport comments that he makes it a point to leave the customer completely satisfied \nwhen he leaves a job site, and he strives to be a good example. (AE C at 4.) His 2006 \nperformance report comments that \u201c[he] has been a great addition to the [military base] \nteam. His willingness to learn and dedication have earned him the respect of the \ncustomer, fellow employees, and supervisors. His resourcefulness and initiative while \ndeployed to a war zone are nothing short of outstanding. [He] is a self motivated and \nenthusiastic leader that will have a great future in our organization.\u201d (AE C at 11.) \n \n  Applicant has worked with units overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has \nserved 90-day deployments in Iraq three times in the summers of 2004, 2005, and \n2006. Applicant testified that he deployed to Afghanistan for a 90-day period in either \n\n \n6 \n \n \nJanuary 2005 or January 2006. His 2007 performance report indicates he deployed to \nAfghanistan in 2007. The January 2007 date is the more accurate date. (Tr at 57-58; AE \nC.) \n \nHe is the commander of his American Legion Post. He was previously a service \nofficer and on the executive committee at the post. (Tr at 55-56.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply.  From 1974 to \nMay 2003, Applicant was arrested or charged with offenses on 14 occasions. Ten of \nthose charges involved or related to domestic disputes. In the 1970s, Applicant was \narrested and charged with Driving While Under the Influence; Possession of Marijuana; \nContempt of Court/Driving With A Suspended License and Failure to Pay fine and \nContempt of Court/Driving With a Suspended License. The Possession of Marijuana \ncharge was dismissed. He was convicted of the other three offenses.  \n \nThe criminal conduct concern can be mitigated. I find that Criminal Conduct \nMitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) applies.  Applicant has not been arrested or charged with an offense since \nMay 2003. The last arrest involved an argument with his intoxicated, underage stepson. \nApplicant\u2019s actions were out of self-defense as opposed to intentional aggression. The \nDistrict Attorney dismissed the charges after interviewing witnesses. He has become \nmore responsible over the five year period since his last offense.  Since 1983, the \nmajority of the offenses were related to family arguments or involved child support \nissues.  Applicant\u2019s children are grown and the child support situation is resolved. His \ndomestic situation with his current wife appears to be stable.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) applies \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6 1.f.  The case went to trial and Applicant was found not guilty. \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies.  Close to five years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last \narrest. During that time, Applicant made a positive contribution to his employer as \nevidenced by his favorable performance reviews. He has deployed to Iraq on three \noccasions and to Afghanistan on one occasion. He is the commander of his American \nLegion Post. Although Applicant has an extensive arrest record, the majority of the \narrests involved domestic disputes with Applicant\u2019s former wives. While I do not \ncondone Applicant\u2019s past history of domestic disputes, his current domestic situation is \nstable.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omission of his July 1999 arrest for Assault/Causing Bodily Injury on \nhis January 5, 2006, security clearance questionnaire raises the potential application of \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). Applicant explained that \nhe did not list the July 1999 arrest on his security clearance application because he \nthought it was more than seven years old. I find his explanation credible. He listed his \nmost recent arrest for Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon.  He listed a 1977 DUI \narrest in response to question 23(d). The July 1999 arrest occurred near the seven year \nmark. It is reasonable to conclude that Applicant thought it was over seven years old.  I \nfind for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a.   \n \n \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies to Applicant\u2019s \nadmission in January 1996, that he did not list his use of marijuana between 1973 to \n1974 on a personal security questionnaire dated November 15, 1994.   \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nPC DC \u00b6  16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other government representative) is potentially raised pertaining to the alleged \nmisstatement by Applicant during an interview with an investigator on March 21, 2007, \nand on April 10, 2007 that he had no other arrests.  When he was interviewed on March \n21, 2007, Applicant thought that he only had to disclose arrests that were within the past \n7 years. The record is ambiguous as to what Applicant was specifically asked during the \ninterview. The investigator did not testify during the hearing. The basis for the \nfalsification allegation comes from an unsigned, unsworn statement which summarizes \nthe applicant\u2019s interview. The statement which is the basis for the allegation is \nsomewhat vague. The reliability of the statement itself is questionable. It is not clear \nhow soon after the interview the statement was prepared. The government has not \nestablished a prima facie case with respect to this allegation. I find for Applicant with \nrespect to SOR \u00b6 2.b.  \n \n \nDuring his follow-up interview on April 10, 2007, Applicant discussed the arrests \nwhich are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, 1.m, and 1.n. The unsigned, unsworn report of the \ninterview indicates that Applicant said that he had no other arrests. Applicant testified \nthat he did not recall all of his arrests during the interview. He did not have a complete \ncopy of his arrest report with him during the interview. Applicant\u2019s explanation that he \nhad a faulty memory is credible based upon my observations of him during the hearing. \nHe has an arrest history going back 33 years.  \n \n \nApplicant provided information about his previous arrests in past security \nclearance background investigations. He listed the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.n on his most recent security clearance application dated January 5, 2006. In a \nsigned, sworn statement dated January 30, 1996, he listed the arrests alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h and 1.j. On his November 15, 1994, security clearance \napplication, he listed the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.n, and 1.o. \nThe government was on notice about his past criminal history.  Applicant\u2019s frank \ndisclosures in past security clearance applications pertaining to his criminal history, \nsupports the conclusion that Applicant had no deliberate intent to withhold information \nabout his criminal arrest history during his March 21, 2007 and April 10, 2007 \ninterviews. I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c.   \n   \n \n \nIt is alleged Applicant used numerous aliases. Applicant\u2019s explanation that \nGumby was his nickname and the other name was his mother\u2019s maiden name is \nreasonable.  SOR \u00b6 1.e is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern may be mitigated.  PC MC \u00b6 17(c ) (the offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his past marijuana use on personnel security \nquestionnaire completed in the mid 1990s. (SOR \u00b6 2.d.) Applicant listed a 1974 arrest \nfor possession of marijuana on the same security clearance questionnaire. This \n\n \n10 \n \n \nprovided the government sufficient notice that Applicant was involved with marijuana. \nAlthough Applicant admitted that he did not disclose his past marijuana use, the use \noccurred 20 years prior to completing the security application. He would not be required \nto list it under the current format of the security clearance application.  It is also noted \nthat the government granted Applicant access to classified information despite his \nadmission in the 1996 signed, sworn statement. The admission is less significant today \nconsidering the passage of time.  \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns raised under personal conduct.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork history and his clean criminal record for close to five years.  While Applicant has \nan extensive arrest record, most of the arrests involved family arguments. He has not \nbeen arrested since 2003. Since that time, he is making a positive contribution in the \nworkplace. He has deployed to Iraq three times and to Afghanistan once. His \nexplanation for not listing and/or remembering several of his past arrests are credible. \nHe disclosed most of the arrests in past security investigations.     \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under criminal conduct, and personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR\n1\nalleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E\n(personal conduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by\nDOHA on April 8, 2008, admitted all allegations and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued on\nAugust 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing for September 26, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified but did not offer any other evidence. The record was held open to\nprovide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentary evidence in support of\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nNovember 10, 2008\n\n Department Counsel provided copies of the documents to Applicant along with App. Ex. I. However,\n2\nhe had not requested permission at the hearing to submit any post-hearing documentation nor did he notify\nApplicant of her right to object to inclusion of the documents in the record. Because one of the documents (GE\n6) is also included in AE 3, and the other document (GE 5) is beneficial to Applicant\u2019s case and consists of\nGE 4 with a second page added, I admitted them into the record and will consider them in arriving at a\ndecision.    \n2\nher case. Three documents were timely received, marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-3\nand admitted into the record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding\nmemorandum of AE 1-3 was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and is included as\npart of the record. Department Counsel submitted two other documents with App. Ex. I that\nwere marked as GE 5 & 6 and admitted into the record without objection.  The transcript\n2\nwas received on October 10, 2008. \nProcedural Matters\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation contained in SOR\nsubparagraph 2.a. At the hearing, I clarified the allegation for Applicant. Without objection,\nshe was thereupon given permission to withdraw her admission and deny the allegation.\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR Guideline F allegations are incorporated herein.\nIn addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old single woman who has been working for a government\ncontractor as a help desk analyst since May 2006. Her prior employment history consists\nof a variety of jobs interspersed with short periods of unemployment. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1984, and attended college from 1991 to 1996. She was awarded a bachelor\nof arts degree in music in May 1996. While attending college, she worked part-time at a\nbank. She additionally financed her education through student loans. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits she has nine collection accounts, totaling\n$16,015, and five charge off accounts, totaling $10,162. These accounts include numerous\ncredit card debts that have been delinquent for many years. Applicant completely ignored\nthe debts for years and did not make any payments on them. In addition to the listed debts,\nApplicant owes $92,824 on student loans that date back to when she attended college in\nthe 1990s. She has either never made a payment on the loans or not made a payment on\nthem for many years. Payment on the student loans was deferred through at least May\n2008. (GE 2) \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in June 2008. She listed\ncreditors holding secured claims in the amount of $14,000, and creditors holding\n\n  Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n3\n  Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.\n4\n Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated\n5\nNovember 19, 2004.\n  Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n6\n3\nunsecured nonpriority unsecured claims in the amount of $126,255 (this amount includes\nthe $92,824 owed on the student loans). Lawsuits were filed against Applicant in 2006 and\n2007 by two of the creditors listed in the SOR. (AE 3) \nA 10% repayment plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on August 18, 2008,\nrequiring Applicant to pay $178 every two weeks for 60 months. Payments under the plan\nare deducted directly from Applicant\u2019s salary. If she completes the plan, she should obtain\na discharge in or about August 2013.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary is $1,961.34. Her recurring monthly expenses are\n$1,929. She has approximately $300 in savings. (AE 1) She testified she decided to file for\nbankruptcy protection about four years ago but it took her until June 2008 to accumulate\nthe approximately $1,200-$1,300 required by the attorney to file a petition. (Tr. pp. 50-51)\n \nApplicant failed to disclose the delinquent accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs\n1.d through 1.n in the Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) she submitted on\nMay 9, 2006, as required. (GE 1) When asked at the hearing why she answered \u201cno\u201d to the\napplicable question, Applicant testified: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember answering that\nquestion.\u201d (Tr. p. 49) When asked about the false answer in an interrogatory, Applicant\nwrote: \u201cI was in the process and still am of filling [sic] Bankrupcy [sic] so I thought since I\nam doing that I could answer no to that question.\u201d (GE 2)  \nPOLICIES\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  \n3\nThe standard to be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available\ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the\nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.4\nTrustworthiness adjudications apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security\nService and Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor\n5\npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any\nfinal unfavorable access determination is made.6\nAn Administrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the Adjudicative Guidelines when evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust\n\n  Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865. \n7\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n4\nposition. The Administrative Judge must also consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nand any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to sensitive information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security. Decisions are made in terms of the national\ninterest and are not determinations as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.7\nThe Government is required to present evidence to establish controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR.  The Applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other\n8\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel.  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining\n9\na favorable trustworthiness decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect [sensitive] information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant has numerous delinquent accounts, totalling $26,177 just counting those\nalleged in the SOR, that have either been charged off or submitted for collection. Two of\nthe accounts led to lawsuits being filed against Applicant. Additionally, she has over\n$90,000 in student loans on which payment has been deferred since the 1990s because\nof her poor financial status. Applicant ignored the delinquent accounts for years and failed\nto make any effort to resolve them until she finally filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nprotection after receipt of the SOR. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\n Since graduating from college, Applicant has worked at a variety of jobs\ninterspersed with relatively brief periods of unemployment. She failed to make any payment\non the accounts when she was employed, including her student loans, and instead acted\n\n5\nirresponsibly by allowing them to languish and continue to accrue interest. Accordingly,\nMitigating Condition MC 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances is inapplicable. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in June 2008, and had a plan\nconfirmed in August 2008, that requires her to pay $178 every two weeks for 60 months.\nThe payments under the plan are deducted directly from her wages and will result in her\nobtaining a discharge in or about August 2013, if she continues to make the required\npayments. MC 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts applies. \nApplicant has little discretionary income ($32.34) left each month after paying her\nrecurring monthly expenses. She has only $300 in savings. Applicant lacks the ability to\nmake payments on her student loans when and if payment is no longer deferred. I have\nconsidered the remaining Guideline F mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. \nApplicant demonstrated long-term irresponsibility, unreliability and poor judgment\nby accumulating debt she could not service, including substantial credit card debt, and\nthereafter doing nothing to resolve it for years. She finally sought bankruptcy protection in\nJune 2008, but then only after the SOR was issued. It will be almost five years until she\nobtains a discharge in bankruptcy if she maintains the payments required under the\napproved plan. Her past conduct does not warrant findings that she has now assumed a\nfinancially responsible lifestyle, will continue to make the payments required under the\nplan, and/or will not accumulate additional excessive debt in the future. Thus, and despite\nthe Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan she is currently making payments under, Guideline F is\ndecided against Applicant. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant failed to disclose her numerous delinquent accounts in the SF 85P she\nsubmitted in May 2006. She could not provide any reason for the omissions at the hearing.\nHer explanation in response to an interrogatory to the effect that she didn\u2019t think she had\nto disclose them because she intended to file for bankruptcy sometime in the future is not\ncredible. DC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\n\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\napplies. I have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E and find none apply.\nGuideline E is decided against Applicant.  \n   \nThe objective of a trustworthiness determination is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to sensitive information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Applicant has failed\nto overcome the case against her or satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not\nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant access to sensitive\ninformation. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-n:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion  \n             \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Lead Man and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment.

The Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. The Applicant has a long history of abusing alcohol. He first began drinking when he went into the Armed Forces at 17 hears old in 1977. His alcohol use has gone up and down over the years.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 21, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 23,\n2006 (Government Exhibit 1).  On October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline G concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 26, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on January 7, 2008.  I received the case assignment on January 9,\n2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 25, 2008.  The Government offered Government\n\n2\nExhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, without objection.  The\nApplicant requested that the record remain open and, on March 10, 2008, he submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit H, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nMarch 5, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Lead Man and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted all of the\nfactual allegations in the SOR, subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.  Those admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe Applicant has a long history of abusing alcohol.  He first began drinking\nwhen he went into the Armed Forces at 17 hears old in 1977.  His alcohol use has gone\nup and down over the years.  As of the date of the hearing, the Applicant had not\nconsumed any alcohol since receiving the SOR in November 2007, a period of five\nmonths.  That is the longest time that he has gone without consuming any alcohol since\nhe began drinking.  He expresses a credible intent not to drink in the future.  (Transcript\nat 52, 58-59.)\nThe excessive drinking by the Applicant has resulted in numerous alcohol related\nincidents.  The first incident was administration of Non-Judicial Punishment in 1978.\nThis was for being Drunk and Disorderly in Quarters.  (Transcript at 27-28.)\nThe Applicant was arrested and convicted five times between 1979 and 1987 for\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  These incidents occurred in 1979, 1982, 1984,\n1985 and 1987.  The Applicant was required to attend Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous meetings\nor get counseling as part of his sentences for these offenses.  He did not feel that these\nmeetings were helpful to him at the time.  The Applicant admitted that there were other\noccasions when he would drive after drinking to excess.  (Transcript at 39-47,\nGovernment Exhibit 4 at 1-3.)\nThe Applicant is currently married, but has been separated for many years.  He\nwas charged with a domestic violence offense involving his wife in 1990.  According to\nthe Applicant, his wife tried to attack him and in defending himself he hit her in the eye.\nThey were both intoxicated at the time.  He was ordered to attend anger management\nclasses and the charges were dismissed after he completed the course.  (Transcript at\n50-52, Government Exhibit 5.)\n\n3\nThe Applicant and his fianc\u00e9 have been together for 12 years.  An incident of\ndomestic violence happened involving the two of them in January 2006.  They got into a\nheated argument and the Applicant assaulted her.  He plead No Contest to Inflicting\nCorporal Injury on a Spouse and was sentenced to three years probation, one year of\ndomestic violence classes and a fine.  He completed the domestic violence program\nand his probation was terminated in March 2007.  He was intoxicated at the time of this\noffense.  (Transcript at 53-54, Government Exhibit 2 at 3-4.)\nThe Applicant testified that the domestic violence classes he attended after the\nlast incident were very helpful to him.  He now understands the impact that alcohol has\nhad on his life.  His relationship with his fianc\u00e9 is much better now.  (Transcript at 65-\n69.)\nRecords were submitted by the Applicant showing that, after the hearing, he has\nbegun a program of alcohol treatment through his health care provider.  As of the time\nthe record closed the Applicant had two sessions and a Blood Alcohol Level test taken\non each date read \u201c0.0.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H at 5-8.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  Several friends and work associates submitted letters\non his behalf.  The Applicant is described as someone who is \u201ctrustworthy,\u201d\n\u201cconscientious,\u201d and has \u201cintegrity.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  He has received several\ncertificates of recognition and spot awards during his current employment.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit H at 9-35.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThe Applicant was involved in a series of alcohol related incidents from 1979 until\nJanuary 2006.  He has used alcohol habitually, and occasionally to excess, from 1977\nuntil November 2007.  The Applicant only stopped using alcohol because he received\nthe SOR.\n\n5\nThere are two Disqualifying Conditions that apply to this case.  AG \u00b6 22(a)\n\u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 22(c) states a concern is, \u201cHabitual or binge consumption\nof alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nUnder the particular facts of this case, none of the mitigating conditions currently\napply to the Applicant\u2019s situation.  While it has been over two years since the last\nalcohol related incident, the fact is the Applicant has only been completely abstinent\nfrom alcohol for five months as of the date the record closed.  He does acknowledge his\nissues with alcohol, but has no pattern of abstinence or responsible use.  He has just\nbegun alcohol counseling, and it is too early to say that it will be worthwhile.\nThe Applicant is a motivated man who is a fine employee.  Based on the\navailable evidence, it is simply too soon into the Applicant\u2019s complete abstinence and\ntreatment to conclude that he will no longer engage in alcohol related incidents.  If he\ncontinues to abstain from alcohol and engage in counseling he may well be eligible for a\nclearance in the future.  The Applicant has not mitigated the security significance of his\nalcohol consumption and Paragraph 1 is therefore found against the Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has just begun to address his long-standing alcohol\nproblem.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find that the Applicant has not mitigated\nthe security significance of his prior conduct.  As set forth at length above, I find that the\nconduct was recent (AG \u00b6 2(a)(3)); and that there has been insufficient time to\ndetermine that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). \n\n6\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 31, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on October 12,\n2006. On October 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on November 26, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on February 4, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 7, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on March 4, 2008, in\nSan Diego, California. The government offered Exhibits (Ex) 1 through 7, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\n\n2\nA through E, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nMarch 12, 2008. \nAt the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR\nby withdrawing allegation 2.b., which was granted without objection. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 56 years old. He is currently not married, but he was married from\n1981 to 2002, and he has four grown children. He served in the United States Marines\nfrom 1971 to 1993, and he received an Honorable Discharge (Ex E).\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 18 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.r., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the debts will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$2,034.99. In his RSOR and during his testimony, Applicant admitted that this debt has\nnot been paid. He indicated that he contacted this creditor, but could not work out a\npayment plan with them.\n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,981.\nIn his RSOR Applicant denied this debt, but when he testified, Applicant conceded that\nthis was a debt incurred by his ex-wife when they were married, and he still owes this\ndebt, which has not been paid.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $348. At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that he had paid this bill in May 2001, but he had no\ndocumentation to show that this debt has been paid. Based on his lack of records,\nwhich he claimed he left with his ex-wife, who no longer has access to them, and his\nless than complete knowledge about the debts as a whole, I can not conclude that this\ndebt has been paid in full. \n\n3\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $321.\nThis creditor of this debt is listed as the same as 1.c., above. Applicant was not sure\nwhich of these two debts he had paid, or if this was the same debt as the one above. \n \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,034.\nIn his RSOR Applicant denied this debt, but when he testified, Applicant conceded that\nthis was a debt incurred by his ex-wife when they were married, and he still owes this\ndebt, which has not been paid.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $106.\nApplicant testified that he had paid this bill in May 2001, but he had no documentation to\nshow that this debt has been paid. I can not conclude that this debt has been paid in\nfull. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $144.\nThe creditor of this debt is listed as the same as 1.f., above. Applicant testified that this\nis the same debt as 1.f., and he does not owe this debt.   \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,318.\nDuring his testimony, Applicant admitted that this debt has not been paid. He indicated\nthat he has been unable to work out a payment plan with this creditor.\n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $200.\nApplicant testified that he was unaware of the origin of this debt, but he has not\nattempted to dispute this debt, and at this point this debt has not been paid.  \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,145.\nApplicant testified that this debt has not been paid. \n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $331.\nApplicant testified that this debt was incurred because he was the cosigner of a loan\nwith his daughter for a vehicle that was totaled in a collision. At this point this debt has\nnot been paid.  \n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,529.\nApplicant conceded that this was a debt incurred by his ex-wife when they were\nmarried, and he still owes this debt, which has not been paid.\n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $181.\nApplicant testified that he had paid this bill in 2000, but he had no documentation to\nshow that this debt has been paid. I can not conclude that this debt has been paid in\nfull. \n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $908.\nApplicant testified that the correct amount he owes on this debt is actually $400, even\nthough the creditor claims it is the amount cited on the SOR. At this point no amount\nhas been paid on this debt.\n\n4\n1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 15 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $7,693.\nApplicant testified that this debt was incurred because he was the cosigner of a loan\nwith his son for a vehicle that was repossessed because of lack of payment by his son.\nAt this point this debt has not been paid.  \n1.p. This overdue debt to Creditor 16 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,396.\nApplicant testified that he was unaware of the origin of this debt, but he has not\nattempted to dispute this debt, and at this point this debt has not been paid.  \n1.q. This overdue debt to Creditor 17 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $130.\nApplicant testified that he had paid this bill in 2001, but he had no documentation to\nshow that this debt has been paid. I can not conclude that this debt has been paid in\nfull. \n1.r. This overdue debt to Creditor 18 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $200.\nApplicant testified that he has been unable to resolve this bill from a hospital, because\nhe is not sure whether to pay the hospital or his health credit report provider, but  at this\npoint this debt has not been paid.  \nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed SCA on October 12, 2006 (Exhibit 1). The SOR\nincorrectly lists this as allegation 3.a., rather than 2.a., and it lists the question as\nnumber 38  rather than question 28.a. At the hearing, the SOR was amended to show\nthe corrected SOR allegation number and the corrected question number.  Question\n28.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to this question, and he listed one debt. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed as 1.a. through\n1.i., 1.m., 1.p., and 1.r., discussed above in the SOR.\nApplicant testified that he misunderstood the question and believed it was asking\nonly for debts that had arisen over the last seven years preceding the date he\ncompleted the SCA, or debts in which he had been contacted by the creditors, and\nsince his other debts were older than seven years, and he claimed he had only been\ncontacted by one creditor, he did not believe he had to include the other debts in his\nanswer. \nApplicant explained that his previous financial difficulties were incurred because\nhis wife had incurred some of the bills while he was stationed overseas, and he was not\nalways fully employed after he left the Marine Corps. However, his debts also included\nseveral loans of which he was a cosigner, and debts that occurred over many years,\nand he could give no reasonable explanation for why these debts were not reduced\nover the years.  \nApplicant purchased a Nissan Titan in 2007 for $28,000, on which he is making\npayments of $659 a month. While it was not alleged, had Applicant purchased a less\n\n5\nexpensive vehicle or one that was not new, he may have had more available income to\nreduce his very significant debt. \nFinally, Applicant  offered into evidence a letter, dated June 21, 2001, from an\nindividual who knew Applicant in his professional life (Ex C). He spoke in extremely\nlaudatory terms of him as a hard working employee who \u201cwould be an asset to any\nestablishment.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n6\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s long history of not meeting financial\nobligations and his inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve the vast majority of overdue debts, even those for which the amount is not\nsignificant.  I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect material information to the Government on the SCA that he executed on\nOctober 12, 2006. Applicant only identified one debt that was over 180 days overdue in\nthe last seven years prior to his completing the SCA, when clearly there were many\nmore debts he should have identified. However, Applicant testified credibly that he\nmisunderstood the question. By Applicant answering \u201cYes\u201d to the question and listing at\nleast one overdue debt, he did put the Government on notice that he had some financial\ndifficulties. I find that Applicant did not intend to mislead the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against\nApplicant. I therefore, resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\n\n7\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, even the small ones, and his latest\nvehicle purchase of $28,000, rather than purchasing a less expensive vehicle and using\nsome of the saving to pay off some of his debts, I find that the record evidence leaves\nme with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 61-year-old woman who has been employed by a defense contractor since April 1985. Her current employment position is as a traffic coordinator. She submitted a letter from her supervisor that strongly indicates she is a trusted and valued employee. Applicant has held a secret level security clearance for approximately the past 15 years and no prior adverse action has been taken to revoke or downgrade that clearance.

Applicant submitted a response to the SOR\nthat was received by DOHA on October 22, 2007. She admitted all SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 20, 2007. A notice of hearing was\nissued on November 29, 2007, scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2007. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nthat were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted into the record without\nobjection. The Government also submitted a chart summarizing the contents of Applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports that was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App Ex) I, and made part of the\nrecord. Applicant testified and submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-3, and admitted into the record without objection. The record\nwas held open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents in support of her case.\nFollowing the hearing, I received a letter from Department Counsel detailing his efforts to\nobtain from Applicant any additional documentation she wanted to submit. That letter was\nmarked as App Ex II, and is included in the record. The transcript was received on January\n4, 2008.     \n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 61-year-old woman who has been employed by a defense contractor\nsince April 1985. Her current employment position is as a traffic coordinator. She submitted\na letter from her supervisor that strongly indicates she is a trusted and valued employee.\nApplicant has held a secret level security clearance for approximately the past 15 years\nand no prior adverse action has been taken to revoke or downgrade that clearance.\nApplicant graduated from high school in 1964. She reported in security clearance\napplications she submitted that she also attended college from January 1980 until July\n1982. She has not earned a degree. Applicant was married in November 1980 and\ndivorced in November 1985. She has two adult children. \nApplicant has been living with a man in a domestic relationship for a number of\nyears. They reside in a house she has owned and lived in since June 1983. Applicant\nvalues the house, on which there are no mortgages, at somewhat less than $300,000.\nApplicant\u2019s gross salary, as of June 29, 2007, was $1,058.48 per week. As of that date,\nshe earned $24,862.98 in 2007, although her net pay only amounted to $8,454.47, largely\ndue to deductions for loan repayments and garnishments. Applicant also contributes\n$105.85 per week to a savings plan through a wage deduction. As of June 29, 2007, she\ncontributed $3,117.58 to that savings plan in 2007. She testified she has only a couple of\ndollars in bank accounts and an unknown amount in a retirement account.\nApplicant\u2019s domestic partner contributed between $1,800 and $2,400 per month\ntoward their joint living expenses until about three years ago when he was diagnosed with\nlung cancer and no longer able to work. Applicant\u2019s testimony indicated the amount he was\nable to contribute may have actually declined before that time because of his need to take\ntime off from work because he was feeling ill even before he was diagnosed as suffering\nfrom cancer.\nThe Government concedes that the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.g\nare duplicate allegations of the same debt. The Government also concedes that the debts\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n3\nlisted in subparagraph 1.e and 1.j, which, as alleged, totaled approximately $10,479, have\nbeen paid. Those debts were satisfied by means of Applicant\u2019s wages being garnished by\nthe creditors. The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.I, in the amount of $3,894, has also been\nsatisfied by means of a wage garnishment.\nThe remaining debts alleged in the SOR represent accounts that are listed in\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports as delinquent or as having been charged off, submitted for\ncollection, or on which a judgment has been obtained against Applicant. The total owing\non those accounts as alleged in the SOR is approximately $30,000. Applicant submitted\na letter from a law firm (AE 3) which indicated a judgment was entered against her on\nNovember 12, 2007, on one of the alleged accounts in the amount of $24,561.55, so it is\nclear her actual current delinquent indebtedness is much greater than what is alleged in\nthe SOR. AE 3 also indicates the law firm placed a restraint on Applicant\u2019s bank accounts,\nafter which she signed an agreement authorizing the bank to pay $1,896.68 to the law firm\nto have the restraint removed. There is no record evidence that the money has actually\nbeen paid.\nApplicant testified her financial problems are the result of the loss of income that\nwas previously provided by her domestic partner. However, several of her accounts were\ndelinquent for at least a couple of years before her partner was forced to completely stop\nworking about three years ago. Based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, the record is unclear\nwhether those earlier delinquencies are the result of a diminishment of the financial\nassistance he provided or due to overspending.              \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\n\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleged approximately $40,000 in debt that became delinquent or was\ncharged off, submitted for collection or resulted in a judgment being entered against\nApplicant. Two of those debts have been satisfied, but only because the creditors were\nable to garnish Applicant\u2019s wages. As alleged in the SOR, there is still almost $30,000 in\ndelinquent debt, although the recent judgment entered against Applicant indicates her\noutstanding delinquent debt is much greater. Her history of allowing accounts to become\ndelinquent goes back at least five years. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or\n\n5\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\nApplicant has failed to take any affirmative action to resolve any of her delinquent\ndebt. The accounts that have been satisfied are the result of aggressive collection action\nby the creditors. Applicant\u2019s testimony overwhelmingly establishes she has no plan to\nresolve the delinquent accounts or to find a way to assume a financially responsible\nlifestyle. Indeed, she testified she has not sought any type of assistance from any agency\nor individual who might be able to help her attain financial stability. Aggravating her lack\nof action to resolve her financial situation is the fact that she has approximately $300,000\nin equity in her home and money deducted from her salary for a savings plan that could\nbe used to satisfy all her indebtedness and leave her with what should be a very\nmanageable single mortgage payment. Rather than pursue this remedy or any other\npotential remedy, Applicant continues to allow judgments to be entered against her and her\nwages to be garnished. I have considered all mitigating conditions and conclude that none\napply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern\ncaused by the financial considerations present in this case. She has failed to overcome the\ncase against her or satisfy her ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-j:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on \nNovember 9, 2004. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 28, 2008\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 31, 2007, and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the \nresponse on November 7, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non December 5, 2007, and I received the case assignment on December 6, 2007. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 18, 2007, scheduling the hearing \nfor January 9, 2008.  The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough I, which were received without objection, and he testified on his own \nbehalf. I held the record open until January 25, 2008 to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE J \nthrough Q without objection, which were forwarded to me by Department Counsel \nby letter dated January 28, 2008 (Exhibit I). DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on January 17, 2008. The record closed on January 28, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a thorough review of the evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old steamfitter foreman, who has worked for his \ndefense contractor employer since January 2000. He previously held a security \nclearance from 1990 to 1999 while employed as a pipefitter for a defense \ncontractor. Tr. 18-20, GE 1. Applicant has held and maintained an interim top \nsecret clearance since 2005. Tr. 21-22, AE F.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1987. Tr. 17. Applicant has \nbeen married since June 1995. He and his wife have a four-year-old son. GE 1, \nTr. 22. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his February 2007 credit bureau report, and Response to \nDOHA Financial Interrogatories dated July 10, 2007. GE 3, GE 2. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified five separate line items to include a chapter 13 \nbankruptcy filed in July 2007, a past due primary mortgage in the amount of \n$345,118, a past due secondary mortgage in the amount of $88,763, a past due \ncredit union account in the amount of $3,541, a past due automobile loan in the \namount of $1,061, and a 2005 non-federal income tax debt arrearage in the \namount of $12,452. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in the latter part of 2006. He \npurchased a new vehicle and used an existing vehicle as a trade-in. The unpaid \nbalance on his trade-in vehicle was not paid off by the automobile dealer in a \n\n \n3\ntimely manner requiring Applicant to make unplanned car payments for two \nvehicles. Applicant was also faced with an unplanned property tax increase, which \nrequired timely payment. Added to this, Applicant purchased a business and \nrented machinery with money he expected to receive from overtime from his \nexisting job. The overtime did not occur as planned. In short, Applicant\u2019s budget \nwas sufficiently strained to the point that he was unable to make any unplanned \nadjustments. Tr. 62-69. \n \nWith the exception of the past due automobile loan for $1,061 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e.), the other four debts listed in SOR are included in Applicant\u2019s chapter 13 \nbankruptcy repayment plan. With regard to SOR \u00b6 1.e., Applicant paid that debt \noff as of June 28, 2007. Tr. 32-35, 40, AE E. \n \nApplicant is on a five-year chapter 13 repayment plan. For the first three \nmonths following approval of his repayment plan which began in August 2007, \nApplicant paid $890 by check or money order to the bankruptcy trustee. Beginning \nin November 2007, Applicant\u2019s monthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee \ndecreased to $850 per month, which he is making and will continue to make for \nthe duration of his repayment plan by automatic payroll deductions. He submitted \npost-hearing documentation verifying that fact. AE J, AE K.  \n \nApplicant stated he was current on his debts until he ran into financial \ndifficulty in 2006 as evidenced by his credit report. Tr. 74, AE H.  Applicant \nconceded he made some \u201cbad decisions.\u201d Rather than seek chapter 7 bankruptcy, \nhe chose chapter 13 bankruptcy because he \u201c[does] have a willingness to satisfy \ndebts.\u201d Tr. 87-90. \n \nApplicant is also making monthly mortgage payments of $2,287 to his \nprimary mortgage of $345,118 and $867 to his secondary mortgage of $88,763. \nApplicant fell behind on these two payments following the approval of his chapter \n13 repayment plan as a result of bankruptcy attorney legal fees.  He submitted \nbudget documentation during his hearing and post-hearing that he is current with \nhis late monthly mortgage payments as of March 2007. Tr. 29-32, 71-73, AE B, \nAE G, AE P. \n \nAs part of Applicant\u2019s chapter 13 bankruptcy, he was required to undergo \nfinancial counseling, which he completed in July 2007. AE O. \n \nApplicant provided three work-related reference letters from supervisory \npersonnel. The letters describe Applicant as a \u201cvaluable asset,\u201d \u201cambitious to \nlearn,\u201d \u201c[having a] willingness to go the extra distance,\u201d \u201chonest,\u201d \u201chard working,\u201d \nand \u201cambitious, dependable, trustworthy and willing to work the long and odd \nhours . . . to keep the facilities running during government business hours.\u201d AE L, \nAE M, AE N. His post-hearing budget reflects he has a net remainder of $678 \nafter he pays all his monthly bills. AE P. \n \n\n \n4\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as \nto obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n\n \n5\n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern \nis that an Applicant\u2019s \n \n \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged he made some poor financial decisions. Part of \nhis problems were due, in part, to anticipated overtime not materializing and his \nautomobile dealer failing to pay off the note on his trade-in vehicle. These events \ncreated a financial tailspin from which Applicant was unable to recover. When \nfaced with significant financial problems, Applicant made reasonable efforts to \nconfront and resolve his financial problems. Rather than seeking a chapter 7 \ndischarge, he sought to repay his debts through a chapter 13 repayment plan. As \nof March 2008, he is current on his mortgage arrearages and has always been \ncurrent on his payments to his chapter 13 trustee. He began his five-year \nrepayment plan in August 2007. Since November 2007, these payments have \nbeen made to the bankruptcy trustee by payroll deduction. Applicant also sought \ncounseling as required by the bankruptcy process.  \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt \nor establish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6\n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be \nexplained by subject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay \ngambling debts, family conflict or other problems caused by \ngambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \nlisted supra, two are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable: \u00b6 20(b) the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control; and \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history before he encountered difficulty and favorable \nevidence supports a finding that he has established a track record of financial \nresponsibility, and has taken control of his financial situation. Noteworthy is the fact \nApplicant has a 12-year history of successfully holding a security clearance. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case.

On September 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on October 17, 2007, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on December 3, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 17,\n2007, originally scheduling the hearing for January 10, 2008.  Applicant requested a\ncontinuance based upon good cause and the hearing was rescheduled for January 30,\n2008.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant presented one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\n\n2\nExhibit A.  The record remained open until March 3, 2008 to allow the Applicant to\nsubmit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted five Post-Hearing Exhibits,\nreferred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A through E.  She also testified on her\nown behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on February 11, 2008.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 31 years old, married, and has a high\nschool diploma and one year of college.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a\nHuman Resource Director and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection\nwith her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  She is\nindebted to 23 separate creditors totaling approximately $44,000.00.  Credit reports of\nthe Applicant indicate that this is mainly credit card debt.  (See Government Exhibits 4,5\nand 6).  Her financial problems started in October 2003, when she lost her job, a month\nor so after she had purchased a house.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D).  In\nan effort to keep from losing their house, in August 2004, the Applicant and her husband\nfiled for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.  They made the monthly payments to the Bankruptcy\ntrustee until the Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job.  In October 2004, her husband found a\njob for a brief period, but was then laid off due to lack of work.  Unable to afford to make\nfurther payments, the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy was dismissed on May 11, 2005.  They\nlost their home in August 2005.  \nHer husband has experienced several periods of unemployment starting in 2004,\nwhen he was laid off.  He found another job in January 2005, but was injured on the job\nand went out on disability in June 2005.  He was on disability until September 2007, at\nwhich time he was laid off again.  He is presently unemployed.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit C).   \n\n3\nThe Applicant was advised by her mother and grandmother to try and re-\nestablish her credit by opening up two more credit card accounts.  Instead of improving\nher credit, it only made the situation worse.  \nThe Applicant was unemployed from October 2003 through June 2004.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D).  She began working for her current employer in\nApril 2005, as an Administrative Assistant, earning $1,800.00 a month.  In July 2006,\nshe was promoted to Human Resource Director, earning $2,400.00 a month.\nIn an effort to resolve her indebtedness, the Applicant sought out credit\ncounseling and was advised that she needed to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy in order to\nkeep her home.  In November 2007, the Applicant consulted with an attorney who told\nher that she was eligible to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.  She entered into a retainer\nagreement to pay the attorney $1,800.00 to file the Bankruptcy.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A).  She inquired as to how to convert her Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7.  The\nApplicant did not fully understand the difference between \u201cdischarged\u201d and \u201cdismissed\u201d\nand erroneously thought that for the past two years, she no longer owed the delinquent\ndebts because she had not been contacted by any of the creditors.  (Tr. p 40).  It was\nexplained to her by the attorney that she still owed each of the creditors.  At that point,\nshe made a down payment of $300.00 toward the $1,800.00 that it cost to file Chapter 7\nbankruptcy with hopes of paying the remainder of the retainer when she received her\nincome tax refund.  The Applicant testified that she was planning on filing Chapter 7\nBankruptcy within the next two weeks.  (See Tr. p. 50).\nThe record remained open following the hearing to allow the Applicant the\nopportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  She submitted four Post-\nHearing Exhibits, one of which is a Bankruptcy Typing Agreement she entered into with\na paralegal agency to prepare her Chapter 7 Bankruptcy for filing.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit E).  The Applicant decided to use a more affordable service to file\nher Chapter 7 bankruptcy than the attorney in order to use the difference to pay the\ndebts that cannot be discharged in the Bankruptcy.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit A).   \nApplicant states that her income tax returns were audited by the Internal\nRevenue Service and her refund is being withheld to pay state taxes.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit A).  \nThe Applicant also indicates that her husband is currently looking for employment\nand if he does not find it within the next two months, they are going to downsize from a\nhouse to an apartment.  The Applicant\u2019s finances are tight.  She is able to stay current\non most of her monthly expenses but has had difficulties making her car payment.  She\njust brought it current this month.  (Tr. p. 34).  Their financial situation will vastly improve\nwhen her husband finds employment.   \n\n4\nLetters of recommendation and awards submitted on behalf of the Applicant\nindicate that she has been an exceptional performer on the job who demonstrates\nleadership, professional excellence, integrity, team spirit and a willingness to do\nwhatever it takes to get the job done.  She is a quick learner and has the propensity to\nlearn the intricacies of what is required of her position.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit B).   \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals reflect that she is meeting all requirements of\nher position and either exceeds expectations or is competent in all areas.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B). \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2\nof Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nto grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is\nthe careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.\nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nA number of circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control caused her financial\nproblems including her job lay off, her husband\u2019s series of lay offs and disability and his\npresent unemployment.  However, since April 2005, for the past three years, she has\nbeen gainfully employed.  She testified that she was going to file Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\nin two weeks and the record remained open for that period.  She has not yet filed\nChapter 7 Bankruptcy, nor has she set up a payment schedule with her creditors.  She\nremains excessively indebted in an amount in excess of $40,000.00.  She has not\nreduced her overhead and is barely able to meet her monthly obligations.  To her credit,\nshe has had some financial counseling and has recently hired a paralegal company to\ntype a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition for her.  However, its simply too little, too late.     \nUpon review of her financial picture, it appears that she has no disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay her delinquent bills.  Her decision to file Chapter\n7 Bankruptcy is a legal remedy available to her under the circumstances, but she has\nfailed to exercise the option. Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations are applicable.  None of the mitigating factors apply.  Her\nfinancial problems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not\ninitiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\nher debts. \n\n7\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Glenn P. Schillo, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on January 10, 2006. On \nOctober 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 25, 2007; answered it on \nNovember 16, 2007; and requested a decision on the record without a hearing. DOHA \nreceived his answer on November 19, 2007.  On December 7, 2007, Department \nCounsel requested a hearing in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8, and was ready to \nproceed on December 27, 2007. The case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 18, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nMarch 28, 2008 \n\n \n2 \n \n \nFebruary 12, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through O, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record closed on February 12, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 21, 2008. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a (6). At \nthe hearing, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His admissions in his answer to \nthe SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following \nfindings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old consultant for a federal contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since June 2003. He served as an officer in the U.S. Army \nReserve from April 1970 to November 1996, retiring as a lieutenant colonel (Tr. 40). \n \n \nApplicant is married and has a 12-year-old daughter (Tr. 63). He received \nbachelor\u2019s degrees in metallurgical engineering and chemistry in 1970, a master\u2019s \ndegree in materials science in 1971, a degree equivalent to a master\u2019s degree in \nbusiness administration in 1977, and a doctorate in materials science and engineering \nin 1978. \n \nApplicant received a clearance in May 1990. His employer sponsored his \napplication for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in March 2004 (GX \n4). His application was for SCI eligibility was denied in March 2005 (GX 3). This denial \nof access was alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and the basis for the denial was the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (1) through 1.a (6). He appealed the denial of SCI eligibility (GX \n5, 6, and 7). His appeal was denied in June 2005 (GX 8). \n \nApplicant\u2019s work is time sensitive, involves extensive travel, and requires long \nwork days (Tr. 72-73). From about October 1996 through June 1999, Applicant worked \nas a self-employed consultant. From July 1999 to October 2001, he worked as a full-\ntime employee of a consulting firm. From October 2001 to June 2003, he worked out of \nhis home for a consulting firm. During all three periods involving three different \nemployers, Applicant claimed reimbursement for more than his actual travel expenses.  \nHe would claim more than he spent for a meal because no receipt was required for less \nthan $20. He would claim more miles driven to the airport than actual mileage, overstate \nthe amount of tolls paid, and overstate the cost of gasoline for a rental car (GX 4 at 1). \nHe explained to security investigators that he did not consider his claims for meals, \ngasoline and tolls fraudulent, because he worked long hours, did not take time for \nformal meals, claimed less for gasoline than rental agencies would charge for gasoline, \nand incurred numerous unreimbursed incidental expenses (GX 6 at 2). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAbout once a year, Applicant used frequent flier miles to fly to a client site and \nthen charged his employer the cost of the tickets.  On two occasions, in September \n2004 and November 2004, he purchased airline tickets for duty travel, used his personal \nvehicle to drive to the duty locations, and then claimed and received reimbursement for \nthe cost of air travel (Tr. 77-78). He did not consider his conduct employee theft \nbecause he frequently saved his employers money by flying on weekends, flying \nthrough airline hubs rather than non-stop, and driving to more distant airports to benefit \nfrom lower fares (GX 6 at 3). At the hearing, he admitted the factual allegations and \nattributed them to his \u201csubjective rationalization\u201d of his conduct (Tr. 108-11). \n \nDuring calendar years 2006 and 2007, Applicant intentionally forfeited vacation \nhours and holiday pay in an effort reimburse his employer for his false claims for \nreimbursement.  By his calculations, he returned 34 hours at $77.65 per hour in 2006 \nand 44.5 hours at $80 per hour in 2007 (AX M). As of the date of the hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s employers were not aware of his false claims for reimbursement or his \nreimbursement procedure (Tr. 71, 88).  Applicant believes he would be \u201cconsidered for \ntermination\u201d if his employer knew about his fraudulent claims for reimbursement (Tr. \n89). \n \nAt some time after initiation of Applicant\u2019s SCI application and the ensuing \npolygraph examination, Applicant consulted with a lawyer and an accountant and \nreceived advice about the proper method of accounting for his expenses. Based on that \nadvice, he changed his methodology and now keeps accurate records and files \naccurate reimbursement vouchers (Tr. 85-86). \n \nFor about 15 years, Applicant claimed charitable deductions for cash donations \nto his church of $100 per week when he actually donated $10-$15 weekly.  He claimed \nclothing donations of $475 for clothing worth less than $100, and claimed business \nexpenses for which he was fully reimbursed by his employer (GX 4 at 2; Tr. 90-91).  He \nmade the same false claims in his 2006 federal income tax return, even though he knew \nhis false tax returns were one of the reasons his application for a SCI clearance was \ndenied (Tr. 91, 99). He testified he inflated his charitable deductions to compensate \nhimself for the expenses of maintaining a home office.  He also testified he was advised \nby an accountant that deductions for a home office were more likely to be audited than \ncharitable contributions (Tr. 91-93). \n \nApplicant submitted ten letters of recommendation from colleagues and \nsupervisors (AX C-L). All the letters describe him as honest, dedicated, loyal, \ntrustworthy, dependable, and a person of high integrity and moral standards. The letters \nwere written at Applicant\u2019s request (Tr. 58). He testified none of the letter writers were \naware of his false tax returns and only one, submitted by a fellow Army Reserve officer \n(AX K), was aware of his false reimbursement vouchers (Tr. 95). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s application for SCI access was denied for \nsubmitting fraudulent travel vouchers to three separate employers from October 1996 to \nJune 2003 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (1), (2), and (4)); using frequent flyer mileage to obtain airline \ntickets and then submitting reimbursement vouchers for the tickets (SOR \u00b6 1.a (3)); \ncashing in airline tickets paid for by his employer, driving to his destination, and keeping \nthe refunds for the airline tickets (SOR \u00b6 1.a (5)); and filing fraudulent federal income \ntax returns by inflating his charitable contributions and claiming business expenses for \nwhich he was reimbursed (SOR \u00b6 1.a (6)).  \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline E is set out in AG & 15 in pertinent \npart as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  \nPotentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline include \u201cdeliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer\u201d; \u201ca pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations\u201d; and \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information \nabout one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, \nsuch as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), (d)(3), and (e).  Applicant\u2019s false \nreimbursement vouchers, his concealment of his conduct from his employer, his \nvulnerability to being terminated for his dishonesty, and the damage disclosure of this \nconduct would cause to his professional and community standing raise all three of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions above, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers to an employer may be \nmitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n17(a).  This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not informed \nhis employers of his false reimbursement vouchers. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This is a compound mitigating \ncondition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was minor, long ago, infrequent, or occurred under \nunique circumstances.  If any of these disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating \ncondition is not fully established unless the conduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s inflated travel vouchers, considered separately, may have \nbeen minor thefts. Each fraudulent tax return was a misdemeanor under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n7207. However, the amounts involved in the airline tickets were significant. Thus, I \nconclude the first prong (\u201cso minor\u201d) is not established. The second prong (\u201cso much \ntime has passed\u201d) also is not established because his fraudulent conduct continued \nthrough tax year 2006. The third prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is not established because of \nhis multiple fraudulent acts. His 15-year track record of fraud casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant received legal advice long before he received the SOR.  \nHe continued to rationalize and justify his behavior in his answer to the SOR. He finally \nacknowledged his behavior at the hearing. He has not established that his fraudulent \nbehavior is \u201cunlikely to recur, because he continued to file fraudulent tax returns even \nafter they cost him his opportunity for a SCI clearance. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e).  Applicant admitted he has not told his employer about his fraudulent behavior \nand he acknowledged that it could cost him his job. Moreover, disclosure of his \nfraudulent conduct would damage his professional and community standing. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 17(e) is not established. None of the other enumerated mitigating conditions under \nthis guideline are established. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that the same conduct alleged under Guideline E also raises \nsecurity concerns under this guideline. The security concern under this guideline is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18 in pertinent part as follows: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \n \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201cdeceptive or \nillegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income \ntax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other \nintentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(d). Applicant\u2019s fraudulent travel \nvouchers raise this disqualifying condition. \n \n \nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same. AG \u00b6 \n19(f). Evidence that Applicant claimed false charitable contributions for 15 years on his \nfederal income tax returns raises this disqualifying condition. \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial conduct can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  AG \u00b6 20(a).  Like AG \u00b6 17(c) \nunder Guideline E, this is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs \nand one conjunctive prong.   \n \nThe first prong (\u201cso long ago\u201d) is not established, because Applicant continued to \nfile fraudulent tax returns through tax year 2006. The second prong (\u201cso infrequent\u201d) is \nnot established because of his numerous fraudulent tax returns. The third prong \n(\u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is not established, \nbecause his fraud occurred during routine filing of tax returns and travel vouchers.  \nFinally, his fraudulent travel claims, and fraudulent tax returns over a 15-year period, \ncontinuing even after he knew the denial of his SCI application was based on part on his \nfraudulent tax returns, preclude a finding that it is unlikely to recur and cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nreceived counseling from a lawyer and an accountant, but he continued to file fraudulent \nreturns.  I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent, exceptionally well-educated adult. He served as \nan officer in the Army reserve for twenty years. However, his history of fraudulent \nconduct suggests a propensity to violate rules for personal convenience and to \nrationalize his violations. He is highly regarded by many colleagues and friends; \nhowever, all but one of those who submitted statements on his behalf were unaware of \nhis behavior. To this day, he has not been candid with his employer.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E and \nF, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a (1)-(6):  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

On July 13, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On January\n23, 2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s failure to mitigate the\nGuideline F security concerns is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that the outstanding\ndebts listed in the SOR had been either paid off, successfully disputed, or charged off and were\nunenforceable.   Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \n1\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel\nthe Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to\nweigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still owed\nsignificant amounts on debts that had been charged off.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-23894 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 6, 2008).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions.  She gave Applicant partial credit under the relevant\nmitigating conditions and found in his favor as to several of the SOR allegations.  However, she\nreasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient\n\n3\nto overcome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nThe favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App.\nBd. Sep. 4, 2007).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security\nclearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on August 7,\n2006. On July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 2, 2007, and elected to have\nhis case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on August 15, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of\nrelevant material (FORM) on August 22, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file\nJanuary 23, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted seven items in support of its contentions.\n1\nThe case was originally assigned to another judge but was reassigned due to caseload considerations.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s undated answer to SOR).\n3\nApplicant\u2019s Response to FORM.\n4\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated August 7, 2006).\n5\nItem 6 (Applicant\u2019s Response to DOHA Interrogatories, dated June 6, 2007).\n6\nAttachment - Social Security Statements- with Applicant\u2019s Response to FORM.\n7\n2\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.1\nApplicant submitted additional information on September 11, 2007. The case was\nassigned to me on January 10, 2007.  Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\n2\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, which was undated, Applicant denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, of the SOR, with explanations. He also denied the factual\nallegation in \u00b6 2.a of the SOR.  He provided additional information to support his request\n3\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.  \n4\nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended college\nin 2005 and received a technical certification. He is married with three young children.\nHe has worked for his current employer since June 2006.5\nIn 1996, Applicant opened several credit accounts. He worked as a sheet metal\nworker at the time. He purchased a home, a new truck, and acquired some loans. His\nincome for that year was $5,000. After a year, Applicant was laid off from his job and\ncollected unemployment. He obtained loans to pay his bills. Applicant sold his truck to\npay the truck loan. He continued to make house payments and payments for utilities.\nHis other obligations went unpaid.6\nAlthough Applicant remained employed as a sheet metal worker from 1997 until\nSeptember 2000, his salary slowly progressed yearly from approximately $9,000 to\n$15,203. In 2001, his salary dropped to $9,844. During this time period Applicant\u2019s work\nwas seasonal.7\nApplicant obtained more loans to cover his bills between steady employment.\nHowever, he could not make payments on the loans and they became delinquent. He\ncould not afford to file for bankruptcy. He stopped using his credit cards in\napproximately 2000. His credit rating was unsatisfactory at the time. He chose not to\npay anything on the delinquent accounts so that he could keep his house and pay the\nutilities. He reasoned that the loan companies had insurance on the loans and charged\n\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, undated).\n8\nItem 5 (Credit Bureau Report for Applicant, dated August 24, 2006).\n9\nItem 7 (Credit Bureau Report for Applicant, dated June 28, 2007).\n10\nItem 6 (Personal Financial Statement, dated June 6, 2007).\n11\n3\nthe accounts off. Applicant believes he does not owe any of the delinquent accounts. He\nadmits this was not a responsible way to handle this financial matter. Moreover,\nbecause the accounts are over seven years old and do not appear on his recent credit\nreport, he firmly believes he does not have to pay them. His concern is saving money\nand paying cash for things to avoid the use of credit cards. He currently has two\naccounts that are in good standing.  \n8\nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts and a tax lien from 1999. The SOR\naffirms that the tax lien has been fully satisfied in the amount of $420 and Applicant\nasserts that this was for his grandfather who had the same name. The total amount of\ndebt is approximately $20,000.  Applicant asserts that the medical account in allegation\n9\n\u00b6 1.a for $57 should have been paid by his employer but he also stated that he could\npay it but has not. For several allegations, including allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f,\nApplicant denied owing the accounts because they are more than seven years old.\nThey are collection accounts and have been charged off. They total approximately\n$9,400. The SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.e for a medical bill of $210 was paid.  Allegation \u00b6\n10\n1.g for a collection agency appears to be the same as allegation 1.b. Applicant states he\nhas never done business with the collection agency named in \u00b6 1.g, or the creditor listed\nin \u00b6 1.h.\nApplicant\u2019s income steadily increased from 2002 until the present. The salary\nrange is $22,000 to $64,000 for 2006. Applicant worked two jobs in order to earn the\nhigher income. His current monthly gross income is $5,500. After monthly deductions of\n$900, he has a net remainder of $2,651. He lists total assets as approximately\n$67,000.11\nApplicant disputed several collection accounts and is satisfied that since they do\nnot appear on his 2007 credit report, he does not owe them. He has not paid them\nbecause they are not collectible and are charged off. While it may be true that a state\nStatue of Limitations (SOL) may render an account more than seven years old ineligible\nfor litigation purposes, it does not mean the debt is no longer owed. The SOL refers to\nthe creditor\u2019s right to sue in order to collect the money. The debt is not erased.\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. He did not contact his\ncreditors to arrange any settlements or even small payments on any of the delinquent\naccounts. He is now cognizant of credit card use and pays cash for goods. His credit\nrating has improved with the deletion of some of the older accounts. He is current with\nhis mortgage and other bills. \n\n4\nOn his August 7, 2006, security clearance questionnaire, Applicant answered\n\u201cno\u201d to Section 28. Your Financial Delinquencies. The response indicated he was not\nmore than 180 days delinquent on any debt. He stated he did not respond affirmatively\nbecause the accounts were not on his credit report and that he answered to the best of\nhis knowledge.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]NY doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. His credit reports confirm that he has not paid the\ncharged off collection accounts. He does not intend to pay the debts due to the age of\nthe accounts. The activity for the delinquent debts ranges from 2000 until 2005. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose between about 2000 and 2001. He accumulated some\ndelinquent debt due to his low salary and some seasonal employment. While the\nunemployment may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point.\nThe Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing and he has not resolved the debts. His\ninaction after being employed raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\n\n6\nthe financial problems arose from his seasonal employment and lower income. He did\nnot act responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially\nmitigating condition is not a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received counseling and has not resolved\nthe delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. He is now financially sound and\nprepared for future contingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do\nnot apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case his credit bureau report confirms\nthat he disputed some accounts and that one account was a duplicate. I conclude this\npotentially mitigating condition applies in part.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, Applicant believed he did not owe any money on his delinquent\naccounts because they were old and falling off his credit report. He did not consider\nthem delinquent at that point in time but rather closed or charged off accounts. He did\nnot intentionally falsify his security clearance application. \nUnder 16(a), the government established that he omitted a material fact from his\nanswer to Section 28. He denied that he deliberately or knowingly falsified an answer to\nhis security clearance questionnaire and that he answered to the best of his knowledge.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of\n\n7\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\nApplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or\ncircumstantial evidence regarding an Applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred. The government has not established that Applicant deliberately falsified his\nanswer to Section 28. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began,\nApplicant was a young man. He accumulated debt due to circumstances largely beyond\nhis control, including sporadic employment and low income. However, he did not act\nresponsibly under the circumstances. He is married and has three children. As a result,\nhe has focused his attention on providing a stable domestic environment for his family.\nHe did stop using credit cards and now pays cash for his goods. However, he has not\ntaken affirmative action to pay or resolve most of the delinquent debts raising concerns\nabout his good judgment. True, the Statute of Limitations has expired, making some\ndebts uncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus, this debt cannot be a source of improper\npressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance. Applicant has not resolved most of his delinquent debts and does not intend\nto do so. He has not met his burden of proof in this case to overcome the government\u2019s\ncase. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied. \n \nOn May 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 28, 2008, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on September 15, 2008. The FORM was \n1 \n \nDecember 15, 2008\n\n2 \n \n                                                          \nmailed to Applicant on September 16, 2008, and it was received on September 24, \n2008. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not \nsubmit additional material. The case was assigned to me on November 19, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations. I have \nconsidered the entire FORM and make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old single mother of four children, ages 16, 15, 13 and 4. \nShe has worked for a federal contractor as a claims associate since December 2006. \n \n \nApplicant has 25 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $44,775. Her \ndelinquent debts span a period of eight years. She had her automobile and mobile \nhome repossessed in 2003. Some of her delinquent debts are from medical expenses \nincurred in 2000 or 2001 and 2004, 2005 and 2006. Her medical expenses were \ncovered by insurance, but she was responsible for co-payments that remain unpaid. In \nher interview on February 21, 2007, with an Office of Personnel Management \nInvestigator that she adopted and swore to on March 20, 2008,1 she stated she had not \nreceived collection notices on these medical debts, believed that her co-payments were \nup to date and was going to review her credit report and contact the creditors and her \nhealth care insurance provider in order to correct or dispute the accounts. Applicant did \nnot provide any further information that she followed up on her plan.  \n \n \nIn addition to delinquent medical debts, Applicant also has delinquent debts \nowed to a telephone company, a loan company for her mobile home that was \nrepossessed, an auto loan, personal loan creditor, a tire company, a bank for overdrafts \nand other creditors. She admitted owing these debts, but also stated she disputed \nsome, had settlement offers from others and was going to contact the creditors. She did \nnot provide any further information that she has contacted the creditors, or satisfied or \nresolved any of these delinquent debts. Applicant did provide proof of payment on a \ndelinquent electric bill that was not included in the SOR. She stated in her interview that \nshe intended to pay certain debts listed in the SOR by specific months during 2007. No \nproof was provided that she followed through on these promises. She stated in her \ninterview that she became financially overextended and could not pay some of her \nbills.2 \n \n \nApplicant did not provide any answers to the interrogatories requesting her to \nprovide information as to what she has done to resolve each specific debt alleged and \nto provide documentary proof of her actions.3 No other information was provided. \n \n \n1 Item 6. \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Item 7. \n\n3 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n4 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions and especially considered AG & \n19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d). Applicant has approximately $44,755 in delinquent debt that she \nis unable or unwilling to pay. Some of the debts date back approximately eight years. \nDespite her promises to look into the matter and pay some of the debts, she failed to \nprovide any evidence of such efforts. Both (a) and (c) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the \nmitigating conditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20 (a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so \nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) and (e) (\u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d).  \n \n\n5 \n \nApplicant did not provide any amplifying information or documentation to support \nshe has contacted her creditors, attempted to resolve her delinquent debts, disputed \ndebts she believed she paid or was not responsible for, or any other information to \nconsider in mitigation. Considering the limited information that was provided I conclude \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a single mother of four \nchildren. She has numerous delinquent medical debts that she believed her insurance \nwas responsible for, but she failed to provide any evidence that she attempted to \nresolve these debts with the creditors. She also has numerous other delinquent debts \nthat remain unpaid. She stated that some of the creditors had offered settlements and \nshe was going to accept and pay them, but did not provide any further information to \ndocument she paid any of the debts. She has other debts that she is unable to pay. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.y: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR, signed on October 18, 2007, in which he denied all\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nFebruary 15, 2008\n\n Department Counsel alleged in the FORM that Applicant admitted both debts alleged in the SOR.\n2\nIn his SOR response, Applicant actually claimed all debts were paid while agreeing they were his debts and\nwere once delinquent. As such, I interpret his response to those allegations to be denials.\n \n2\nallegations and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a\nhearing.   \n2\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on\nOctober 25, 2007, that was mailed to Applicant on October 30, 2007. Applicant was\ninformed he had 30 days from receipt of the documents to submit his objections or\ninformation he wished to be considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on\nNovember 2, 2007, but did not submit a response to the FORM or object to anything\ncontained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case was assigned to me on\nJanuary 28, 2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel submitted a document entitled Motion to Amend the Statement\nof Reasons that was provided to Applicant along with the FORM on October 30, 2007. The\nmotion seeks to add the following allegation as subparagraph 2.c:\nYou falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application, signed by\nyou on September 7, 2006, when you answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to the\nfollowing question: \u201cSection 23 - Your Police Record - d. Have you ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or\ndrugs?\u201d By answering \u201cNo\u201d to this question, you deliberately failed to\ndisclose that on August 10, 1985, you were arrested and charged with\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs.\nApplicant failed to respond to the motion. Accordingly, the motion to amend is allowed and\nApplicant\u2019s failure to admit or deny the added allegation will be considered as a denial of\nthe allegation.    \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 42 years old and, since August 2005, has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since August 2005, as an engineering analyst. He was previously employed as\na technician by a different employer from March 2005 to August 2005. Applicant served\non active duty in the United States Navy from February 1984 until his retirement in March\n2005. He attained and retired at the rank of chief (paygrade E-7). Applicant held a secret\nlevel security clearance for most of the time he served on active duty. \n\n3\nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1989, and he obtained an Associate\nin Applied Science degree in June 2004. He was married in June 1992, and that marriage\nended in divorce in October 1992. He has been remarried since February 1993. \nApplicant\u2019s October 2006 credit report discloses a judgment was entered against\nhim in or about October 2001, in the amount of $12,219. In his response to interrogatories\npropounded to him, Applicant indicated the judgment was the result of 10 years of late fees\nthat had been charged to a closed account and the judgment creditor was looking into the\nissue. He also indicated he was awaiting a response from the creditor before attempting\nto resolve the matter. In his response to the SOR, Applicant stated he was working on\npayment options with the creditor. Although the account does not appear in Applicant\u2019s\nSeptember 2007 credit report, there is no record evidence to indicate he has taken any\naction to resolve or otherwise satisfy this account.\nApplicant\u2019s October 2006 credit report also discloses an account that was placed\nfor collection in or about August 2005. In his response to the interrogatories that were\npropounded to him, Applicant indicated this account was to be satisfied by his checking\naccount being debited by the creditor in August 2007. He submitted a letter from the\ncreditor wherein the creditor acknowledged that agreement and stated it would provide him\na paid in full letter upon actual receipt of the funds. In his response to the SOR, Applicant\nstated this account was paid in full and proof of the same was submitted to DOHA. The\nFORM does not contain any actual proof of payment. Again, this account does not appear\nin Applicant\u2019s September 2007 credit report. There is no other record evidence to indicate\nApplicant has actually paid the account.  \nApplicant failed to disclose either of the delinquent accounts in an Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) he executed and submitted on or\nabout September 7, 2006, in response to questions inquiring about debts that had resulted\nin unpaid judgments or had been more than 180 days past due in the preceding 7 years.\nApplicant\u2019s only explanation for not disclosing the debts, contained in his response to the\nSOR, is that he was unaware of their existence. Applicant also failed to disclose in the e-\nQIP that he was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs\n(DUI) in August 1985, in response to a question asking if had ever been charged with any\noffense related to alcohol or drugs. Because Applicant failed to respond to the FORM or\nMotion to Amend the Statement of Reasons there is no record evidence to explain this\nomission. \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance.

The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n11\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nApplicant has two severely delinquent debts, totalling over $15,000. One has been\nsubmitted for collection and the other resulted in a judgment being entered against\nApplicant. The judgment has been outstanding for over 6 years and the account that was\nsubmitted for collection has been delinquent for more than two years. While Applicant\nclaims to have satisfied the collection account and indicated he was attempting to resolve\nthe judgment, he failed to submit any proof in support of those claims. Although neither\naccount appears in the most recent credit report that is contained in the FORM, there is\nno record evidence to indicate their deletion is the result of any action on the part of\nApplicant. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nand DC 19\u00a9: a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant failed to provide any meaningful explanation in his answers to the\ninterrogatories that were propounded to him or in his response to the SOR to explain why\nthese debts became delinquent, what actions he has taken to resolve them, or why they\nwere not satisfied years ago. He also failed to provide any documentation in support of the\nlimited information he did provide, namely that the judgment account is the result of late\nfees charged to a closed account and the collection account was satisfied by debiting his\nchecking account. I have considered all potential mitigating conditions under Guideline F\nand, based on the limited information available to me contained in the FORM, I find none\napply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant failed to disclose the two delinquent accounts and his 1985 DUI charge\nin the e-QIP he submitted in September 2006. Other than the unsupported and\nunexplained assertion contained in his response to the SOR that he was unaware of the\ndelinquent accounts, there is no record evidence to explain these omissions. DC 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, of similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.\nI have considered all mitigating conditions under Guideline E and find none apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \n\n6\nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including the whole person concept based upon what little is known about Applicant,\nthe factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying\nconditions. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by the\nfinancial considerations present in this case and his personal conduct. He has failed to\novercome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines F\nand E are decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a & b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal \nconduct and alcohol consumption. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nOn November 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 19, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on March 17, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 21, 2008, and the hearing was convened as \nApril 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nscheduled on April 7, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A and B, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to keep the record open until April 21, 2008, to submit additional matters.  \nApplicant submitted a fax cover sheet and three letters, which were marked AE C \nthrough F, and received without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. The record closed on April 21, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on April 22, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanations, with the exception of \u00b6 2.a, which he denied. He also provided \nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has never been \nmarried and has no children. He is a high school graduate with some community college \nclasses.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in a state other than where he lived on March 21, 1993, \nand charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He pled no contest and was fined \n$1,428, ordered to spend 48 hours in jail, and ordered to attend an alcohol education \nclass. In 1996, a bench warrant was issued for his failure to complete confinement, \nfailure to enroll in an alcohol education class, and failure to pay his fine. Applicant did \nnot resolve this matter until January 24, 2003, when he returned to the court. He paid \nhis fine, served one day in jail, and was permitted to complete his alcohol class in his \nstate of residence. He attended classes at a counseling center two times per week for \nthree months between February and May 2003. He was apparently diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser. The credentials of the individual who diagnosed the Applicant were not \nprovided.2  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in his state of residence on March 11, 2000, and charged \nwith DUI. He was given two breath tests and registered .195% and .190% blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC). He pled guilty to the amended charge of reckless driving. He was fined \n$490 plus fees, and ordered to attend DUI School and a Victim Impact Panel.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 45; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 21-26; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 5. \n \n3 Tr. at 22; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn August 8, 2002, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons which included \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, based upon Applicant\u2019s two \nDUIs. Applicant returned to the court to address his first DUI on January 24, 2003, four \ndays before his DOHA hearing on January 28, 2003.4 Applicant was granted a security \nclearance by the Administrative Judge on March 28, 2003.5 \n \n \nApplicant works at a U.S. Government site away from where he lives. He works \nfour ten-hour days per week, Monday through Thursday, or Tuesday through Friday. \nWhen he is working he stays at the job site, where temporary lodging is provided. He \narrives at the site the morning of the first work day and goes home after work on the \nfourth day. The site has facilities such as a gym and a bar. On seven occasions \nbetween March and June 2005, Applicant left work early without authorization on the \nlast day of the work week. He submitted incorrect time sheets that listed that he worked \na complete week. His company issued Applicant a letter of reprimand in July 2005 for \nthese actions. Applicant estimated that he left about an hour early on each occasion. He \nrepaid the company for seven hours of salary.6   \n \n \nIn about June 2006, Applicant was directed by his foreman to dump fluid into one \nof the inactive waste water treatment ponds on the facility that was dry. He dumped \nabout 300 gallons of fluid into an active pond, which created a potential environmental \nhazard. Applicant did not intentionally dump the fluid into the wrong pond; he had not \npaid sufficient attention to what the foreman wanted him to do. He received a letter of \nreprimand in July 2006, and was suspended two days without pay.7   \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was involved in an incident with two co-workers at the \nwork site. They were drinking in a dorm room and began roughhousing and wrestling. At \nsome point his co-workers told him that it was getting late and that he should leave. \nApplicant refused to leave and there was some pushing involved. Applicant called \nsecurity at 911 stating he was in fear of being assaulted by the two other men. Security \ntook a report and escorted Applicant back to his room. After the incident he remained \ncordial with his two co-workers.8 \n \n \nApplicant was issued a letter of reprimand from his supervisor for the above \nincident. His supervisor asked him to voluntarily seek alcohol rehabilitation through his \nemployer\u2019s Employee Assistance Program. He was told that if he had any more alcohol-\n                                                          \n4 The SOR alleges that the hearing took place on January 23, 2003. The transcript of that hearing \nand the decision both clearly state that the hearing took place on January 28, 2003. \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 11, 12. \n \n6 Tr. at 38-40, 4-9; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. at 40-43; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 19, 27-28; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4, 5. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nrelated incidents that he would be terminated. Applicant chose not to avail himself of \nalcohol rehabilitation as he does not believe that he has an alcohol problem.9 He stated: \n \nI mean I get up to work every morning, I show up to work shaven, clean; I \ndon\u2019t show up to work with alcohol on my breath; I don\u2019t need a drink the \nfirst thing in the morning; I don\u2019t need a drink every day; I don\u2019t drink \nheavy booze.10 \n \n \nApplicant will usually have at least a couple of beers almost every day. He will \noccasionally have a few beers after work when he is working at the Government site. \nVery rarely he will have a shot of tequila from a small bottle that he keeps in his freezer \nat the site. He will have about six beers on the night he gets home from the work site. \nHe testified that he can drink about a twelve pack of beer on his days off. Applicant is a \nregular churchgoer and he stated that he does not go to church \u201chung over or smelling \nlike booze.\u201d11 \n \n \nApplicant submitted several character letters from a co-worker, a friend, and the \npastor at his church. The co-worker described him as a hard worker, knowledgeable in \nhis craft, dependable, rarely misses a day of work, and he gets along with his co-\nworkers in work situations and personally. His friend stated Applicant always treats \nothers with respect and he can be counted on. His pastor wrote that he is trustworthy, \nindustrious, and friendly.12 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 31-33; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 4. \n \n10 Tr. at 33. \n \n11 Tr. at 34-38, 44, 46-47; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 5. \n \n12 AE C-F. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and  \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment.  \n \n \nApplicant left work early without authorization on seven occasions in 2005. He \nintentionally submitted incorrect time sheets that listed hours that he did not work. This \ndishonest behavior is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(d) as credible adverse information that \nis not explicitly covered under any other guideline, but which supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also raises AG \u00b6 16(e) as \npersonal conduct that could affect Applicant\u2019s personal, professional, and community \nstanding. There was no specific evidence that it was in violation of a written or recorded \n\n \n7 \n \ncommitment made by Applicant to his employer as a condition of employment. AG \u00b6 \n16(f) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant did not pay sufficient attention to what his foreman wanted him to do \nand he dumped about 300 gallons of fluid into an active pond, which created a potential \nenvironmental incident. While unintentional, it was poor judgment and raises AG \u00b6 \n16(d). Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incident and calling 911 on his co-workers is sufficient \nto raise AG \u00b6 16(e). \n \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant\u2019s time sheet incident occurred in 2005. He fully admitted the behavior \nand repaid the salary he dishonestly received from his company. AG \u00b6 16(e) is a factor \nfor consideration for that conduct. The dumping was a one-time incident and \nunintentional. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to that conduct. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nincident is also alleged under Guideline G. It raised concerns under Guideline E as \npersonal conduct that could affect Applicant\u2019s personal, professional, and community \nstanding. Applicant is once again on good terms with the two co-workers. This has \nreduced Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable to that conduct.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits, DUIs, and alcohol-related incidents are sufficient to \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a)-(c). Applicant admitted to being diagnosed as an alcohol abuser. No \nreports from the counseling center were submitted as evidence. The credentials of the \nindividual who diagnosed the Applicant were not provided. The Appeal Board has stated \nthat an Administrative Judge should take an expansive view of what constitutes a duly \nqualified medical professional and a licensed clinical social worker:  \n \nACDC 22(d) and (e) contemplate a broad range of providers who, by \neducation and by position, are qualified to diagnose and treat alcohol \ndependence and other substance abuse disorders. By its own terms, \u00b6 \n22(d) lists the previously mentioned types of care providers by way of \nexample only.13  \n \n                                                          \n13 ISCR Case No. 07-00558 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 7, 2008). \n \n\n \n9 \n \nIn the case cited by the Appeal Board, the official in question held licenses in counseling \nand in the treatment of substance abuse and was the Director of a substance abuse \ncounseling center.14 No such information is available in the instant case. Even under the \nexpansive view directed by the Appeal Board, I am unable to find sufficient credible \nevidence to find AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) or (e) directly applicable. Applicant\u2019s failure to attend the \nalcohol education class as ordered by the court in 1993, until 2003, raises AG \u00b6 22(g).  \n \nApplicant went to a security clearance hearing for his two DUIs and the \nAdministrative Judge granted Applicant a security clearance. This does not raise any \nindependent disqualifying condition under Guideline G. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f are \nconcluded for Applicant. He did not take his supervisor\u2019s advice to voluntarily seek \nalcohol rehabilitation through his employer\u2019s Employee Assistance Program after his \nlast alcohol-related incident. That also does not raise any specific disqualifying condition \nunder Guideline G. SOR \u00b6 2.h is concluded for Applicant.15  \n \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant had a DUI in 1993. He did not complete the requirements of his \nconviction because it occurred in another state. He had another DUI in 2000. He finally \n                                                          \n14 Id. \n \n15 The facts in this paragraph do not raise a disqualifying condition but will be considered when \napplying mitigating conditions and in analyzing the whole person. \n\n \n10 \n \naddressed his 1993 conviction in 2003, when his security clearance hearing was \nimminent. He had another alcohol-related incident in January 2007. Applicant continues \nto drink regularly and sometimes excessively. None of the mitigating conditions are \ntotally applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had DUIs in 1993 and \n2000. He refused to complete the requirements of his 1993 sentence until it became an \nissue for his security clearance. He committed timecard fraud on seven occasions in \n2005. He had another alcohol-related incident in 2007. He continues to drink regularly \nand at times excessively. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his Personal \nConduct and Alcohol Consumption.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn October 20, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On August 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 20, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 23, 2007, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five \nJanuary 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on October 30, 2007. Applicant received \nthe FORM on November 1, 2007, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. On November 13, 2007, Applicant submitted a letter that I \nmarked Applicant Exhibit (AE 1) and admitted into the record without objection from \nDepartment Counsel.  On December 21, 2007, the case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge and reassigned to me on January 4, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6 1.a  He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and single. In October 2002, he graduated from college \nwith a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunications Management. After leaving school, \nhe worked for several employers and was unemployed for a period of time. In October \n2006, he began working as a systems engineer for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor. In October 2006, he submitted an SF 86. (Item 4). \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant completed Interrogatories regarding disclosures he \nmade in his SF 86 about drug use. Applicant admitted that he used marijuana at least \nfifteen times from October 1996 to September 2006. (Item 4 at 40; Item 5 at 2). He does \nnot intend to use it in the future, claiming he used it while he was in college and at a \ndifferent stage of his life. He no longer associates with those friends who use illegal \ndrugs.  (Item 5 at 2-3).  In his November 13, 2007 letter, he reiterated his commitment to \ndiscontinue using marijuana, acknowledging its illegality. He acknowledged his mistakes \nand does not excuse his behavior. He has made lifestyle changes, including a \ncommitment to his present employer. (AE 1). He offered to execute a document \nproviding for an automatic revocation of his security clearance, should he be found to \nhave taken drugs in the future. (Id.).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: (1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified \nand listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhallucinogens), and; (2) inhalants and other similar substances; (b) drug \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions that he used marijuana from approximately \nSeptember 1996 until September 2006, the Government raised a potentially \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse (see above definition).\u201d \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation.  I \nconsidered two mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that may be potentially applicable \nto the disqualifying condition:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand, \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that AG \u00b6 \n25(a) does not apply. Applicant used illegal drugs at least 15 times from September \n1996 until September 2006, the last incident being about a year ago.  Given his ten-year \nhistory of marijuana use, an asserted year of abstinence is insufficient to trigger \napplication of this condition. His past behaviors do cast doubt on his trustworthiness and \ngood judgment.   \nApplicant stated he does not intend to use the illegal substance again because of \nthe changes he has made in his life, including no longer associating with people who \nuse illegal drugs. He offered to sign a statement that he would agree to an automatic \nrevocation of his clearance should it be determined that he used drugs in the future. \nThose facts warrant the limited application of AG \u00b6 26 (b) \u201ca demonstrated intent not to \nabuse any drugs in the future,\u201d as noted by his (1) dissociation from drug-using \nassociates and contacts,\u201d and his willingness to execute (4) \u201ca signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d  However, without \nindependent evidence to corroborate his discontinuation of drug abuse or to monitor his \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision not to use drugs, if given a clearance, full application of this condition is not \nwarranted.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 31-year-old man, who \nbegan using drugs in college and continued using them past graduation, up to a month \nbefore beginning his current employment with a federal contractor. While I find his \ncommitment to change, along with his honesty and statements that he does not intend \nto use drugs in the future helpful, I am not convinced that he mitigated his ten-year \nhistory of marijuana abuse. Absent independent corroboration, such as an evaluation \nfrom an appropriately credentialed health care provider and/or other sources, \ndocumenting Applicant\u2019s assertions that he is drug free, I am concerned there is a \nstrong likelihood that he will use drugs in the future. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, except for \u00b6 1.d, which she denied. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old budget analyst working for a defense contractor. She was born, in the United States to a Lebanese-American father and an American mother. Her father came to the United States at age 18. He was afraid of the war in Lebanon (Tr. 64) and entered the United States as a political refugee seeking work and college education. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen, married a U.S. native citizen and completed his higher education in the United States. According to Applicant, her father dislikes the politics in Lebanon, and but for his retirement entitlement, he would have moved to the United States (Tr. 65). Her father plans to live in the United States after he retires from his job in Lebanon (Tr. 51). When Applicant was two years old, her father took a job with a U.S. organization doing business in Lebanon (Tr. 36).

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance applications on September 24, 2007 \n(Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)) and on March 27, \n2006 (Standard Form 86). On October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR (Answer) on November 26, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on January 17, \n2008. DOHA issued the initial notice of hearing on January 18, 2008. The hearing was \npostponed at the Government\u2019s request. DOHA issued the second notice of hearing on \nFebruary 26, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on March 24, 2008. The \ngovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection \n(Tr. 20).2 Applicant testified on her own behalf, and presented two exhibits, marked AE \n1 and 2, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on April 1, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, except for \n\u00b6 1.d, which she denied. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old budget analyst working for a defense contractor. She \nwas born, in the United States to a Lebanese-American father and an American mother. \nHer father came to the United States at age 18. He was afraid of the war in Lebanon \n(Tr. 64) and entered the United States as a political refugee seeking work and college \neducation. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen, married a U.S. native citizen and \ncompleted his higher education in the United States. According to Applicant, her father \ndislikes the politics in Lebanon, and but for his retirement entitlement, he would have \nmoved to the United States (Tr. 65). Her father plans to live in the United States after he \nretires from his job in Lebanon (Tr. 51).  \n \nWhen Applicant was two years old, her father took a job with a U.S. organization \ndoing business in Lebanon (Tr. 36). He took his wife and Applicant to Lebanon where \nshe grew up and was educated until around age 20. Applicant received her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree from a U.S. state university operating in Lebanon. She attended elementary and \nLebanese schools that were supported by American interests. After college, she worked \none year for a Lebanese company.  \n \nSince leaving the United States at age two, Applicant returned to the United \nStates for the first time in 2002 to visit her aunt during a two week period. In 2003, she \nmoved to the United States to attend graduate school. In 2004, Applicant went back to \nLebanon for two weeks to visit her father because he missed her. She started her \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2006 and expects to graduate in May 2008 (Tr. 5-6). She has been \nemployed by a defense contractor during the last two and one-half years. She had \ninterim access to classified information at the secret level during the same period. \n \n \n \n2  GE 5 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHer supervisor considers Applicant to be a very bright and hard working \nemployee. In his opinion, she is honest and forthright. He believes Applicant is very \nhappy being a mother and enjoying the benefits and privileges of being a U.S. citizen. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor recommends her for a position of trust and to receive access to \nclassified information without reservations (AE 1). \n  \nApplicant has two siblings who were also born in the United States. Her parents \ncame back to the United States whenever her mother was ready to deliver her children. \nHer mother was assassinated in Lebanon when Applicant was a child (Tr. 67). Applicant \ntestified she was raised by her father with little assistance from their extended family \nmembers living in Lebanon (Tr. 68). Her father remarried when Applicant was around 12 \nyears old. Her step-mother helped raise her; however, Applicant stated they were never \nclose (Tr. 69). She also has a step-brother. \n \nApplicant has four uncles, five aunts, and approximately 30 Lebanese cousins \nwho are residents and citizens of Lebanon (Tr. 70). She has two uncles who retired \nfrom the Lebanese Army (Tr. 72-73), and four cousins who are currently serving in the \nLebanese Army. According to Applicant, all of them served as enlisted soldiers (Tr. 71-\n73). While in Lebanon, she had frequent contact with her Lebanese extended family. \nSince immigrating to the United States, she has had limited contact with her extended \nfamily members (Tr. 74).  \n \nApplicant claimed she does not have a close relationship with any of her \nextended family members in Lebanon. She only corresponds on a regular basis with her \nfather. She used to e-mail him every day and call him once a week. Now that she is \ntaking care of her child and attending school, she corresponds with her father by e-mail \nonce a week and telephonically once a month. Applicant denies any contact or \ncorrespondence (phone calls, e-mails, of letters) with her aunts, uncles, and cousins in \nLebanon (Tr. 46-48). To her knowledge, none of her siblings or family members have \nconnections to Hezbollah or the government of Syria. She claimed her extended family \nmembers are hostile to both organizations. \n \nIn 2006, Applicant married a U.S. native citizen (Tr. 30, 40). He is a self-\nemployed musician, has never been to Lebanon, and according to Applicant has no \ninterest in ever visiting Lebanon. Applicant and her husband have a 10-month-old \ndaughter who was born in the United States (Tr. 63), and they are expecting a son in \nJuly 2008 (Tr. 40). Applicant considers her children American citizens and does not \nintent to apply for Lebanese citizenship or identification for her children. \n \nApplicant credibly testified she considers herself an American and that her home \nis in the United States. She has no plans to ever return to Lebanon to work or to retire. \nShe never voted in Lebanese elections, joined any political party, or worked for the \nLebanese government (Tr. 32). Applicant admitted she is very close to her father and \nwould not like anything bad to happen to him; however, she has no reason to favor her \nfather over her husband and child (Tr. 31). Applicant and her husband own a $350,000 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhome in the United States, a car, and around $25,000 in liquid assets. They own no \nassets in any foreign country, including Lebanon. \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant reaffirmed her October 2007 (Tr. 71) offer to renounce \nher Lebanese citizenship and to surrender her Lebanese passport. Applicant\u2019s father \nobtained a Lebanese passport for her when she applied for college. She needed the \npassport as identification to be able to attend college in Lebanon. Although she \npossessed a U.S. passport, Applicant used her Lebanese passport to travel to the \nUnited States in 2001, 2003, and 2004 (Tr. 53). Concerning her initial reluctance to \nrenounce her Lebanese citizenship and to surrender her Lebanese passport, Applicant \nexplained she mistakenly believed she would have to return to Lebanon and renounce \nher citizenship in front of her town elders. In doing so, she was concerned she would \nhave placed her father and extended family at risk, and would have been required to \ndisclose she was applying for a security clearance (Tr. 32). She has learned she can \nrenounce her Lebanese citizenship at the Lebanese embassy in the United States and \nintends to do so in the near future. \n \nApplicant brought her Lebanese passport to her hearing. She destroyed her \nLebanese passport in front of Department Counsel (Tr. 56). She then gave the pieces of \nher cut passport to her facility security officer (FSO) for safekeeping (AE 2). Applicant \nconsiders herself a loyal American. She promises to work for the United States in the \nwar against terror. She believes her expertise in the Arabic language, Middle East \nculture, and his professional expertise would well serve the United States (Tr. 29-30).  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Lebanon\u2019s government is a \nparliamentary democracy. Lebanon and the United States have a long-standing friendly \nrelationship. It has been the policy of the United States to help Lebanon preserve its \nindependence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity.  \n \nLebanon is 95% ethnic Arab. Its population is comprised of various Muslim sects, \nChristian groups, and Druze. The three largest population groups are Shi'a and Sunni \nMuslims and Maronite Christians. Lebanon became the situs of several terrorist \norganizations over the past 30 years that have engaged in armed conflict with Israel and \nWestern countries. The Lebanese government recognizes those organizations as \nlegitimate resistance groups. Lebanon exempts \u201clegal resistance\u201d groups from money \nlaundering and terrorism financing laws. The Lebanese government recognizes \nHezbollah, a terrorist group, as \u201ca legitimate resistance group.\u201d Hezbollah derives its \npower and influence from Lebanon's Shi'a community, which makes up about one-third \nof Lebanon's population. Hezbollah maintains offices in Beirut and elsewhere in the \ncountry and has elected deputies in Lebanon's Parliament. It also operates a \ncomprehensive system of health and education services in several parts of the country.  \n \nEven though Syria withdrew its military forces from Lebanon in April 2006, it \nmaintains a covert intelligence presence in Lebanon and offers support for and \nsmuggles arms to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist groups operating in Lebanon. The \nLebanese government's inability to exercise authoritative control in the Hezbollah-\n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \ndominated south of Lebanon and inside Palestinian-controlled refugee camps enables \nterrorists to operate freely in Lebanon. Hezbollah\u2019s continued attacks to Israel continue \nto create instability in the region. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to a U.S. naturalized Lebanese father \nand a U.S. native citizen mother. She is a dual citizen of the United States and \nLebanon. Her parents took her to Lebanon at age two and she was raised and educated \nas a Lebanese citizen. Applicant\u2019s possession and use of a Lebanese passport in \npreference of her U.S. passport constitutes an exercise of dual citizenship and raises \nsecurity concerns under Guideline C. While in Lebanon, she enjoyed the privileges and \nrights of a Lebanese citizen to include, attending Lebanese schools, the use of a \nLebanese passport, owning bank accounts and working in Lebanon. Foreign preference \ndisqualifying condition AG 10(a): \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes . . . (1): possession of a current foreign passport . . ., (3) \naccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits,\u201d \napplies. \n \n \nIn 2004, at age 21, she travelled to the United States and since then she has \nmade the United States her home. She married a U.S. native American, and she has a \nU.S. born daughter and is expecting a son. All of Applicant\u2019s financial and economic ties \nare in the United States. She has no financial, economic, or proprietary interests in any \nforeign country. Since October 2007, Applicant has stated her intent to surrender her \nLebanese passport and to renounce her Lebanese citizenship. The day of her hearing \nshe destroyed her Lebanese passport and later surrendered it to her FSO.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified she was reluctant to renounce her Lebanese \ncitizenship because she mistakenly believed she would have to go back to Lebanon to \nrenounce her citizenship in front of her town elders. She was concerned such action \ncould have placed her father and extended family at risk, and that she could have been \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \nrequired to disclose she was seeking a security clearance. These facts warrant \napplication of Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b): \u201cthe individual has \nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\u201d 11(c): \u201cexercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred . . . when the individual was a \nminor;\u201d and 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d apply. Applicant has mitigated the foreign \npreference security concerns. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with her parents (father and stepmother) and \nsiblings. Her parents and siblings are citizens and residents of Lebanon. The closeness \nof the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent e-mail and telephone contacts with \nher father, Applicant\u2019s travel in 2004 to see her father because he missed her, and her \nparents visit to her in the United States. This contact creates a risk of foreign pressure \nor attempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that Lebanese agents \nor terrorists may exploit the opportunity to obtain information about the United States. \nHer connection to her father and siblings also creates a potential conflict of interest \nbecause her relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern about her \ndesire to help them by providing sensitive or classified information.  \n \nThese close relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because the Lebanese government allows terrorist organizations \nto operate legally within its borders. The Syrian government maintains intelligence \noperations within Lebanon and provides support to terrorist organization within \nLebanon. Both terrorist organizations and Syria have interests adverse to the United \nStates and have organizations that collect sensitive military and technological \ninformation against the United States. Applicant\u2019s connections to her Lebanese family \nalso create a potential conflict of interest because her relationships are sufficiently close \nto raise a security concern about her desire to help her family by providing sensitive \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s relationship with her parents creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion because they reside in Lebanon \nand could be subjected to Lebanese or terrorist pressure. \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that only mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies.  \n \nSince 2003, Applicant has made the United States her home. She attended a \ngraduate program and has worked hard for a defense contractor for approximately two \nyears. She married a U.S. Native American. Her daughter was born in the United States \nand she is expecting a son who will also be born in the United States. All of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial and economic ties are in the United States. Since October 2007, Applicant has \nstated her intent to renounce her Lebanese citizenship and destroyed her Lebanese \npassport. She has promised to use her skill and abilities to assist the United States in its \nwar against terror. Although Applicant is close to her father, she is closer to her \nimmediate family, i.e., her husband and children in the United States. For the above \nstates reasons, I believe that Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Appellant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely \n[she] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [her \nLebanese family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Her frequent contacts and close \nrelationships with her Lebanese family members could potentially force her to choose \nbetween the United States and Lebanon. She did not meet her burden of showing there \nis \u201clittle likelihood that [her relationships with her Lebanese family members] could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nThe nature of Lebanon\u2019s government, its recognition and support of terrorist \norganizations within its borders, its interaction with Syria, and the presence of Syria\u2019s \nintelligence operatives in Lebanon are relevant in assessing the likelihood that \nApplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. The relationship between Syria and the United States, as well as the \nU.S.\u2019 war on terror, increases the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that \nher immediate family members in Lebanon do not pose a security risk and she will not \nbe placed into a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States \nand her Lebanese family members.6 It is likely that terrorist organizations or Syrian \noperatives in Lebanon would target any citizen in an attempt to gather classified or \nsensitive information from the United States. \n \n \n6 See generally ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \n\u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in \nIran).  See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nstandard when an applicant has family members living in Iran).   \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nNumerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. \nHer parents, siblings, and extended family are citizens and residents of Lebanon. \nApplicant has strong ties of affection and or obligation to her parents and siblings. Her \nfamily is vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign power or terrorist \norganizations doing business in Lebanon. \n \nFour of Applicant\u2019s cousins and two uncles (retired) served in the Lebanese \nArmy. Applicant\u2019s father works for a U.S. sponsored organization within Lebanon. \nLikely, the Lebanese government or factions within the country are aware of her travel \nto the United States. Applicant\u2019s family contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because there is always the possibility that Lebanese agents, \nSyrian agents, and/or terrorists may attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members living in \nLebanon to obtain information about the United States.  \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant credibly asserted her loyalty to the United States, \nand her desire to help the United States in its war against terror. Applicant lived in \nLebanon because she was a minor under the control of her parents. Her mother was \nassassinated in Lebanon and her death was never investigated. She attended schools \nin Lebanon with a strong American influence. When she turned 21 in 2003, she moved \nto the United States and has lived in the United States since. In a short period, she has \nestablished strong roots in the United States -- her husband and children are U.S. \ncitizens, and all of her financial and economic interests are in the United States.  \n \nAdditionally, for two years she has worked hard for a government contractor \nearning his trust and his endorsement for her to have access to classified information. \nShe credibly asserted her willingness to renounce her Lebanese citizenship. There is no \n\n \n11 \n \n \nevidence she has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United \nStates, or that he lacks honesty and integrity. There is no evidence that she has \nrevealed to her family in Lebanon the nature of her work or about applying for a security \nclearance. \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance.

On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for drug involvement and personal conduct under Guidelines H and E.  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 19, 2007.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 17, 2008.  Applicant admitted he \nused marijuana with varying frequency from 1974 until July 2007. He does not know \nwith certainty if he used marijuana in the three years before his response.  He denied \nfalsifying information on his e-QIP.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with \nthe case on July 31, 2008.  The case was assigned to me on August 4, 2008.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 20, 2008, for a hearing on September 4, 2008.  I \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  Applicant waived the requirement for 15 days \nadvance notice of the hearing.  The government offered three Government Exhibits \nmarked Gov. Ex. 1-3, which were received without objection.  An additional Government \nexhibit, Gov. Ex. 4, was received with Applicant's submissions after the hearing.  Two \nwitnesses also testified for the government.  Applicant submitted no documents but the \nrecord was held open for him to submit documentary information.  Applicant timely \nsubmitted two Applicant exhibits marked App. Ex. A-B, which were received without \nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on September 18, 2008.  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from 1974 until possibly July 2007.  He further stated that he cannot \nstate with certainty that he used marijuana in the last three years.  He did tell security \ninvestigators that he possibly did use marijuana in July 2007 because the investigator \nwanted a date certain for his last use.  He denied deliberately providing false \ninformation concerning his drug and alcohol use on his security clearance application.  I \nthoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file, the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits.  I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and has worked for a defense contractor for over four \nyeas as a design draftsman.  He has some college education and certificates from \ncertain professional courses.  He is not married (Tr. 61-63; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated \nJanuary 6, 2006).  \n \n \nApplicant did not list drug or alcohol issues in response to questions on his \napplication for a security clearance.  He stated on the e-QIP in response to questions \nthat he had consulted with mental health professionals in the last seven years (Gov. Ex. \n1, e-QIP, dated January 9, 2006).  Security investigators followed up on the mental \nhealth information provided by Applicant and obtained medical the records of \nApplicant's treatment at a mental health facility.  These records indicated prior potential \nalcohol and drug usage as well as a driving while intoxicated offense in 1983 (Gov. Ex. \n3, Medical information, dated November 3, 200).  Security investigators followed-up on \nthis information and interviewed Applicant twice.  \n \n \nThe first investigator, a 20 year member of the New York City Police Department \nwho retired as a detective, testified he has been conducting background investigations \nfor three years.  When he conducts interviews, he makes notes of the interview and \nlater transfers the information to a Report of Investigation which is then sent to his \ncompany.  He was directed to conduct an interview of Applicant to inquire about his \nalcohol use as indicated in his medical records.   \n \n \nThe interview was conducted on January 11, 2007, at Applicant's place of \nemployment.  Applicant denied being treated at a mental health facility for alcohol or \ndrug abuse.  He stated he was treated at the facility for depression.  During the course \n\n \n3 \n \nof the interview, Applicant told the investigator that he started drinking alcohol at the age \nof eighteen, and is a social drinker.  He volunteered to the investigator, in response to \nquestions, that he had been arrested and convicted for driving while intoxicated in 1983.  \nThe case was subsequently dismissed without adjudication as part of an arrangement \nwith the prosecutor and the Court.  He did not indicate any use of illegal drugs (Tr. 14-\n30; Gov. Ex. 2, Interrogatories, dated January 11, 2007 at -4).   \n \n \nApplicant's second interviewer, a retired New York City detective sergeant with \nfour years experience conducting security investigations, testified that he interviewed \nApplicant at his place of work on January 18, 2008.  He was directed to interview \nApplicant concerning his use of marijuana.   \n \n \nApplicant stated he did not report his use of marijuana on his security clearance \napplication because he completed the document quickly and did not realize he should \nanswer yes concerning his marijuana use.  The interviewer following his pattern of \ninterviewing asked about marijuana use in a chronological order, starting with the \nearliest use ending with the latest use.  He requested the extent and frequency of use \nand any changes in use patterns or intensity.  Applicant informed the interviewer that he \nstarted using marijuana in high school in 1974.  He smoked marijuana about two or \nthree times a week at concerts or the beach because it made him relax.  He continued \nthis use pattern until 1986 when his use became less frequent.  He smoked a marijuana \ncigarette at concerts or at the beach with a friend he did not identify usually only once or \ntwice a year.  After 1986, his use of marijuana decreased to smoking one marijuana \ncigarette with the same friend about once every two years at music concerts or the \nbeach.  In response to questions from the investigator, he stated he last used marijuana \nin July 2007 (Tr. 32-53; Gov. Ex. 2, Testimonies, dated January 24, 2008, at 5-6). \n \n \nApplicant testified that he voluntarily entered the mental health treatment facility \nfor depression and not for alcohol or drug abuse.  The intake evaluations lists \ndepression issues as a reason for admission and lists drug abuse and alcohol abuse \namong conditions to be evaluated and considered as a cause of mental health issues \n(see, Gov. Ex. 3, Medical records, October 30, 2003, at 50-52, 56).  Applicant was \nasked by the security investigator when he last smoked marijuana.  He told the \ninvestigator that he last used in July 2007.  However, he is not sure of this use because \nhe remembers using marijuana only every two or three years.  He did state that he \nremembers last use of marijuana on his birthday about four years before the interview.  \nThe security investigator did ask him to try to remember the last use more clearly and \nhe responded with the July 2007 date.  Applicant in his post hearing submission stated \nunequivocally that he last used marijuana in 2004 on his birthday (App. Ex. B, \nStatement, dated September 23, 2008).  \n \n \nHe usually used marijuana with the same friend who he still associates with five \nor six times a year.  He used cocaine about 20 times, LSD about three times, and PCP \nonce in high school with the last use of these illegal drugs in 1983.  He purchased \nmarijuana in the 1970, but not since then.  He stopped using marijuana because he lost \ninterest in the drug (Tr. 55-69).   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant completed his e-QIP in January 2006 in one afternoon.  He sought \ninformation from family, friends, and other sources to include an on-line computer \nsearch to find specific information, like addresses and telephone numbers, to complete \nthe application (Tr. 70-71).  He answered \"NO\" to question 24 asking in the last seven \nyears had he used illegal drugs.  He responded \"no\" because he did not recall any \nspecific use at the time he completed the application.  He was also under pressure to \ncomplete the form.  Only recently did he recall using marijuana on his birthday in 2004.  \nIt may have crossed his mind that if he listed marijuana use on the application it could \nnegatively affect his ability to be granted access to classified information (Tr. 71-74; \nSee. App. Ex. A, Applicant's Statement, dated September 23, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant responded \"NO\" to question 23 asking if he had ever been charged \nwith or convicted of an offense relating to alcohol or drugs.  He did not list the driving \nwhile intoxicated offense because it had been dismissed without adjudication.  It was his \nbelief that it was no longer a part of his record, and he did not have to list it on the form.  \nHe also overlooked the meaning of the question in his haste to complete the application.  \nHe was unsure of whether he had to include the incident on his application as well as \nthe data on the arrests.  He did not want to provide incorrect information (Tr. 74-77; \nApp. Ex. A, Applicant's Statement, dated September 23, 2008).   \n \n \nI find that Applicant last used marijuana in July 2007.  Applicant's testimony \nconcerning his last use of marijuana at the hearing was contradictory and elusive.  He \nstated he was not sure of the time of his last use and eludes to the last use being in \n2004 on his birthday. In his post hearing submission he was sure that he last used \nmarijuana on his birthday in 2004.   However, he told the security investigator in \nJanuary 2008 that he last use marijuana in July 2007.  The security investigator is an \nexperienced questioner who used a chronological and changed circumstances \napproach to determine Applicant extent and last use of marijuana.  The last use in July \n2007 was only six months before the January 2008 interview and would have been \nremembered by Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant's employer provided information that Applicant is a good employee.  \nApplicant's supervisor, engineering manager, and human resource manager stated that \nhe has been employed by the company for over four years.  His overall performance is \ngood.  He consistently completes assignments and willingly works overtime when \nrequired.  He makes valuable suggestions and constructive criticism to improve the \ncompany's product.  They recommend that he be granted access to classified \ninformation (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated September 23, 2008) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  Drug \n\n \n6 \n \nabuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction. (AG \u00b6 24) \n \nApplicant admits that he started using marijuana in 1974.  He provided various \nstatements as to when he stopped using marijuana.  He admitted to security \ninvestigators and in response to the SOR that his last use of marijuana was in July \n2007.  Another time, he stated he could not recall using marijuana after 2004.  I find that \nApplicant last used marijuana in July 2007.  This is sufficient information to raise Drug \nInvolvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use), and DI DC \u00b6 25(c) \n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, \nor distribution).  Applicant also informed security investigators that he used cocaine, \nLSD, and PCP.  Since the government has not alleged the use of cocaine, LSD, and \nPCP in the 1970 to be of security concern, this use of illegal drugs will not be \nconsidered to have raised any disqualifying conditions but will be discussed as it affects \nthe whole person concept.  The government has alleged that Applicant used marijuana \nafter he submitted a security clearance application.  The application was submitted in \nJanuary 2006.  Applicant used marijuana in July 2007.  However, under the \ncircumstances this is not a disqualifying condition since Applicant has not been granted \na security clearance.  His use of marijuana after submitting an application for a security \nclearance will be considered as a factor under the whole person concept but not as a \ndisqualifying condition. \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the illegal drug use. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15)  An \napplicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating \ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nI have considered the drug involvement mitigating conditions (DI MC) and \ndetermine that none apply.  Applicant's last use of marijuana was in July 2007, only a \nyear ago.  Applicant admitted using marijuana from 1974 until 2007, a period of over 34 \nyears, a long period of time.  His period of not using marijuana is only a year compared \nto over 34 years of use.  Applicant presented no evidence that his use of marijuana will \nnot recur.  Accordingly, Applicant has not presented sufficient information to raise DI \nMC AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).   \n \n \nLikewise, he has not demonstrated an intention not to abuse drugs in the future.  \nApplicant stated he lost interest in marijuana and does not intend to use it in the future.  \nThe mere statement that he does not intend to use in the future is not sufficient to raise \nDI MC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation).  \nApplicant still associates with the individual who he used marijuana with in the past.  He \n\n \n7 \n \nhas not used marijuana for only a little over a year.  He has not established that he \nchanged his environment that facilitated his drug use in the past.   \n \n \nApplicant has not raised DI MC AG \u00b6 26(c) (abuse of prescription drugs was after \na severe or prolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has \nsince ended); and DI MC AG \u00b6 26(d) (satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug \ntreatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional).  Applicant received treatment at a recognized medical facility for \ndepression and not drug abuse.  He was not counseled about drug abuse.  He used \nmarijuana after receiving the treatment.  I find against Applicant on Guideline H, Drug \nInvolvement. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n \n \nThe security clearance system depends on the individual providing correct and \naccurate information.  If a person conceals or provides false information, the security \nclearance process cannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified \ninformation is in the best interest of the United States Government.  Applicant's failure to \nlist a 1983 driving while intoxicated conviction and list use of marijuana in response to \nquestions on his security clearance application raises a security concern under \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibility).   \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  While there is a security concern for an \nomission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral \nstatement to the government when applying for a security clearance, every omission, \nconcealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant \nstates that he did not believe he had to list the driving while intoxicated offense since it \nhad been dismissed without adjudication.  He stated he did not list his use of marijuana \nbecause he could not recall any specific use of marijuana and he was in a hurry to \ncomplete the form.  Even though the form states an applicant should list any arrests or \nconvictions for abuse of alcohol, it is reasonable that an individual with no legal training \nwho did not carefully reading the form would not respond in the affirmative for an \n\n \n8 \n \nalcohol-related incident if the case was dismissed without adjudication.  I find for \nApplicant as to personal conduct concerning failure to list his alcohol-related arrest in \n1983 on the security clearance application. \n \n \nApplicant has not presented sufficient information to establish his failure to \nrespond correctly to the question concerning use of illegal drugs was not deliberate with \nan intention to deceive.  Applicant knew of his use of marijuana within the seven years \nprior to completion of the application.  He indicated that it may have been on his mind \nwhen answering the question that if he listed his use of drugs he would not be granted \naccess to classified information.  I find that Applicant deliberately provided a false \nresponse on his security clearance application to the question concern his use of illegal \ndrugs but not in response to the question concerning an arrest or conviction for alcohol-\nrelated offenses.   \n \n \nI considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand determine none apply.  Applicant never made a good faith effort to correct \nerroneous or inaccurate information.  He was questioned twice by security investigators \nabout his alcohol-related arrest and his use of drugs.  While Applicant eventually \nadmitted the alcohol-related offense and his use of drugs to the investigators, it was \nonly after prodding by them and in response to detailed questioning.   \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)  Applicant violated federal law by \nknowingly and willfully providing false information on his security clearance application.  \nThis conduct raises Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31 (a) (a \nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CD DC AG \u00b6 31 (c) (allegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted).  As noted above, Applicant provided false information \nrepeatedly on his security clearance application concerning his use of marijuana.  I have \nconsidered all of the mitigating conditions under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \nAG \u00b6 32 and determine that none apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n\n \n9 \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant used \nmarijuana from 1974 until July 2007.  I also considered that in the 1970s, he used \ncocaine, LSD, and PCP.  I considered that he deliberately failed to list his use of \nmarijuana until questioned by security investigators.  I considered that he continued to \nuse marijuana after submitting a security clearance application knowing that use of \nmarijuana was of security concern.  I also considered the opinion of his employer that \nhe is a good employee who is an asset to their company.  Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts that Applicant will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture.  His use of marijuana and his failure to list his use on the security clearance \napplication leaves me with doubts and questions about his honesty, integrity, \ntruthfulness, trustworthiness, and his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising from his illegal drug use, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a;  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated December 6, 2007, Applicant admitted to all the SOR allegations. Applicant is a 55-year-old senior engineer employed with a Department of Defense contractor. He has been employed with his current employer since August 2000. His employer\u2019s name has changed several times due to mergers and buyouts. He has a Master\u2019s Degree in Engineering and a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). He is married and has five children, ages 20, 18, 7-year-old twins, and 1 1/2. (Tr at 5, 41, 64-65; Gov 1.) Applicant was born in Pakistan. After he obtained his undergraduate degree in engineering, he immigrated to the United States in September 1973 to pursue his graduate studies. In 1976, he was awarded a Masters Degree in Engineering. After he graduated, he worked for various U.S. companies. He attended graduate school while working full-time and received an MBA in 1990. He became a United States citizen on January 12, 1990. He married his wife in 1985. She was a citizen of Pakistan. She became a United States citizen in January 1993. (Tr at 40-43, 64-65; Gov 1.) In February 1993, Applicant accepted a position in Pakistan with a military truck manufacturing company with a mixture of public and private ownership.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on November 11, 2006. On October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn December 6, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 10, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on January \n15, 2008. The case was transferred to me on January 24, 2008. On February 14, 2008, \na Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for March 12, 2008. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 and 2, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The Government requested that administrative \nApril 22,2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nnotice be taken of one document with six attachments. The document was marked as \nAdministrative Notice Document 1 (Admin Not 1) without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted a nine-page document, which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A \nwithout objection. The record was held open until March 26, 2008, to allow the Applicant \nto submit further documents. Applicant timely submitted a ten-page document that was \nadmitted as AE B without objection. DOHA received the transcript of hearing on March \n20, 2008. The record closed on March 26, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nPakistan is a parliamentary federal republic in South Asia. The United States and \nPakistan established diplomatic relations in 1947.  After September 11, 2001, Pakistan \npledged and has supported the US led anti-terror coalition. (Admin Not 1; I. U.S. \nDepartment of State, Background Note: Pakistan, May 2007, at 1-10.) Pakistan is an \nactive partner with the U.S. in the war on terror and has captured several Al-Qaida \nleaders. However, it is widely  believed that Al-Qaida and Taliban fugitives are still using \nPakistan as a refuge, especially in the mountainous tribal regions in the north that \nborder Afghanistan. Pakistan is also a major source of Islamic extremism. (Admin Not 1; \nII, US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country Specific Information \u2013 \nPakistan, dated January 10, 2008 at 2; V, CRS Report for Congress, Pakistani - U.S. \nRelations, updated October 26, 2006; VII, Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of \nNational Intelligence, dated January 11, 2007, at 5, 11.) \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens against non-essential \ntravel to Pakistan in light of the threat of terrorist activity.  Fatal bomb attacks have \noccurred in Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, and Lahore in 2006 and 2007. \nSome of the attacks have occurred outside major hotels, market areas, and other \nlocations frequented by Americans. Other recent targets have included Pakistani \nGovernment officials and buildings, and international non-governmental organizations \n(NGOs). (Admin Not 1; II, US Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Country \nSpecific Information \u2013 Pakistan, dated January 10, 2008 at 2; IV, U.S. Department of \nState, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Travel Warning \u2013 Pakistan, dated January 10, 2008, \nat 1.)  \n \nThe Pakistani government has a poor human rights record. Human rights \nproblems include extrajudicial killings, torture and rape by security forces, lack of judicial \nindependence, \narbitrary \narrest, \nwide-spread \ncorruption, \ndisappearance \nand \nimprisonment of political opponents and trafficking in women and children. (Admin Not \n1, III, U.S. Department of State, Pakistan, Country Reports of Human Rights Practices \u2013 \n2006, released March 6, 2007 at 1; V, CRS Report for Congress, Pakistani - U.S. \nRelations, updated October 26, 2006)  \n \nAdditional concerns are raised due to Pakistan\u2019s transfer of nuclear technology to \nNorth Korea, Iran, and Libya. Pakistan has also sought assistance from North Korea \n\n \n3 \n \n \nand China for its own weapons programs. (Admin Not 1, VI, CRS Report for Congress, \nWeapons of Mass Destruction: Trade Between North Korea and Pakistan, updated \nNovember 28, 2006, at Summary, 2-14.)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 6, 2007, Applicant admitted to all the \nSOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior engineer employed with a Department of \nDefense contractor. He has been employed with his current employer since August \n2000. His employer\u2019s name has changed several times due to mergers and buyouts. He \nhas a Master\u2019s Degree in Engineering and a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). \nHe is married and has five children, ages 20, 18, 7-year-old twins, and 1 1/2. (Tr at 5, \n41, 64-65; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant was born in Pakistan.  After he obtained his undergraduate degree in \nengineering, he immigrated to the United States in September 1973 to pursue his \ngraduate studies. In 1976, he was awarded a Masters Degree in Engineering. After he \ngraduated, he worked for various U.S. companies. He attended graduate school while \nworking full-time and received an MBA in 1990. He became a United States citizen on \nJanuary 12, 1990.  He married his wife in 1985.  She was a citizen of Pakistan. She \nbecame a United States citizen in January 1993. (Tr at 40-43, 64-65; Gov 1.) \n \nIn February 1993, Applicant accepted a position in Pakistan with a military truck \nmanufacturing company with a mixture of public and private ownership. The company \nmanufactured and supplied truck axle components. Applicant accepted the position, \neven though it was a cut in pay, because he thought it was good for his career \ndevelopment.  He also thought accepting the position was a good opportunity for his two \nyoung children, ages three and five at the time, to get to know their grandparents and \nother relatives.  One of his supervisors was a retired general of the Pakistani Armed \nForces. He did not know him before being hired at the company. (Tr at 27-29; 46-47; \nAnswer to SOR.) In 1998, the company started to have financial problems and is no \nlonger in business. Applicant left the company in February 1999 when he moved back \nto the U.S. (Gov 1, section 18; Answer to SOR.)  \n \nWhen Applicant moved to Pakistan, he traveled on his United States passport \nand obtained a work visa for a U.S. citizen. He paid U.S. income taxes during the years \nhe worked in Pakistan.  He did not vote in Pakistani elections. (Tr at 29, 66-67; Answer \nto SOR.)   \n  \nUpon moving back to United States, Applicant was approached by an \nacquaintance of his brother-in-law who owned a software company in Pakistan to \ninquire about whether he was interested in developing a U.S. business which would be \nset up to outsource computer software work to Pakistan.  In February 1999, he entered \ninto a business relationship with this man, a U.S. citizen, originally from Pakistan, and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nanother individual investor, a Canadian citizen, originally from Pakistan. The business \nnever really took off, primarily due to a lack of investment funds, and the agreement was \ndissolved around December 1999. (Tr at 32-37; Gov 1; Gov 2; AE A; Answer to SOR.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in March 1999. In April 1999, he traveled to \nPakistan to attend a religious ceremony in his mother\u2019s honor and to attend a board \nmeeting for the start-up business.  He stayed in Pakistan for about a month. This was \nhis last trip to Pakistan. (Tr at 22-24; Gov 1, Section 18; Gov 2.) \n \nApplicant joined his current company in 2000. He is a senior engineer. He works \non building military trucks with safer cabs to prevent injuries. (Tr at 41-42; Gov 1; AE A.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He has eight brothers and sisters. Two sisters \nand one brother are citizens of and reside in the United States. (Tr at 38; Gov 1.) Three \nsisters and two brothers are citizens of and reside in Pakistan. More specifically: \n \nOne brother, age 60, is a commercial airline pilot and is a retired officer (pilot) of \nthe Pakistani Air Force. He retired in 1996. He has e-mail contact with his brother every \ntwo weeks. The last time he saw his brother was in 2002 at his niece\u2019s wedding in the \nUnited States. (Tr at 53-54; Gov 1; Gov 2.)  \n \nOne brother, age 65, is a professor of engineering at a Pakistani university. He \nlast saw him in 1999 and has e-mail contact with him about every two months. (Tr at 54; \nGov 1; Gov 2.)    \n \nOne sister, age 70, is a retired teacher who taught political science at a women\u2019s \nuniversity in Pakistan. Applicant has occasional telephone contact with his sister every \ncouple months. (Tr at 56, 58; Gov 1; Gov 2.)  \n \nOne sister, age 74, is a practicing obstetrician/gynecologist in Pakistan. Applicant \nhas occasional telephone contact with his sister every couple months. (Tr at 57-58; Gov \n1; Gov 2.)  \n \nOne sister, age 75, is a retired nurse who still practices homeopathic medicine \nfor the poor. Applicant has occasional telephone contact with his sister every couple \nmonths.  (Tr at 57-58; Gov 1; Gov 2.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is deceased. His mother-in-law is a citizen of Pakistan \nand a permanent resident of the United States. She has stayed with Applicant and his \nwife for the past four months. She has nine children. Five of her children reside in the \nU.S., two reside in Canada, and two reside in Pakistan. She travels around to her \nvarious children\u2019s homes to visit. She has two daughters who live in Pakistan. One \ndaughter is a teacher of microeconomics at a Pakistani university. Her husband is a \nsenior officer at a bank. Her other daughter is a housewife. She is married to a shipyard \nworker. His mother-in-law is planning a trip to Pakistan in late March or early April 2008. \n(Tr at 58 \u2013 61.)    \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and five children are U.S. citizens and live with him in the U.S. \nHe owns his home and his investments are in the United States. He has no overseas \ninvestments. He does not own property in Pakistan. (Tr at 66.)   \n \nThe Vice President of Engineering of Applicant\u2019s company states that Applicant \nand the team he leads have been valuable contributors to the military truck \ndevelopment plans in the organization. He has been a key member of the team \ndeveloping the Mine Resistant Armor Protected (MRAP) vehicles being deployed by the \nUS Army to improve the safety of US troops. Applicant demonstrates integrity and good \njudgment and has been a valuable leader for his group. (AE B at 2.) Applicant received \nan overall performance rating of \u201cVery Good\u201d on his last two performance appraisals \ndated February 5, 2007 to January 31, 2008, and January 31, 2006, to February 5, \n2007. (AE B at 3-10.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG &6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. Of the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), the following apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(b) (connections to a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group or country by providing that \ninformation) applies because the Applicant\u2019s two brothers and three sisters are citizens \nof and reside in Pakistan and he has occasional contact with his siblings. It potentially \napplies to his wife\u2019s relatives who are citizens of and reside in Pakistan as well. His \nrelationship with his siblings and his wife\u2019s relationship with her siblings creates the \n\n \n7 \n \n \npotential for manipulation, pressure and or coercion. It does not apply to his past \nbusiness associates in Pakistan because he no longer has contact with them.    \n \nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) & 7(e) (a substantial business, \nfinancial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-\noperated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence of exploitation) was potentially raised due to Applicant\u2019s employment with a \nmanufacturing company in Pakistan from 1993 to 1999; and his involvement in a \nsoftware business set up to outsource software development in the United States to \nPakistan from March 1999 to December 1999.  I find that FI DC \u00b6 7(e) is not applicable \nsince Applicant is no longer involved with either company and currently has no foreign \nfinancial interests.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from Foreign Influence. \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, or government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest) applies.  In order for FI MC \u00b6 8(b) to apply, Applicant must meet at \nleast one of the conditions outlined. The first condition is that there is no conflict of \ninterest because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person(s) is \nso minimal. This condition is not met because Applicant\u2019s relationship with his siblings \nwho reside in Pakistan cannot be considered minimal. The second condition is that \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest.  \nApplicant meets this condition due to his deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S.  He first came to the U.S. in 1973.  He attended graduate school in \nthe U.S., earning two Masters degrees. From 1973 to 1993, he worked for various U.S. \ncompanies located in the U.S. He returned to the U.S. in 1999 and has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2000. He has not returned to Pakistan since May 1999.  The \npeople who he is closest to, his wife and five children, are all U.S. citizens and reside \nwith him in the U.S.  He owns a home in the U.S. All of his property and investments are \nlocated in the U.S.     \n \nWhile security concerns were raised due to Applicant\u2019s acceptance of a job in \nPakistan in 1993, his sense of obligation to the U.S. is revealed by his moving to \nPakistan as a U.S. citizen. He traveled on his U.S. passport. He obtained and renewed \na work visa as a U.S. citizen while working in Pakistan. He did not vote in Pakistani \nelections. He filed U.S. income taxes during the years he worked in Pakistan. He has \nlived and worked in the U.S. continuously for over nine years.  He has not traveled to \nPakistan since May 1999. For these reasons, FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.   \n \nFI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nexploitation) is not applicable.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with his family members who live \nand reside in Pakistan cannot be considered casual and infrequent. However, Applicant \nhas resided in the U.S. over the past nine years, and his immediate family resides with \nhim in the U.S.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Although Applicant has siblings and \nin-laws who are citizens of and reside in Pakistan, security concerns are mitigated due \nto his significant and long standing ties within the U.S.  His immediate family are citizens \nof and reside in the U.S. While he accepted a job in Pakistan after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen, he traveled and worked as a U.S. citizen while in Pakistan. He moved back to \nthe U.S. in 1999 and has not traveled to Pakistan since May 1999. All of his financial \ninterests and property are located in the U.S. He was educated and received two \ngraduate degrees at U.S. universities. He is well respected at his company and has \nreceived favorable performance reviews.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy educational and work history in the U.S., as well as his \nsignificant personal relationships and contacts within the U.S. outweigh any concerns \nraised by having relatives who are citizens and reside in Pakistan. Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 22, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September \n29, 2008. The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on October 16, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 30, \n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Gov) 1 through 12, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted three documents \nDecember 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwhich were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 C and admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on November 7, 2008. The record was \nheld open until November 14, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. \nNo documents were submitted at the close of the record. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nThe Notice of Hearing was sent out less than fifteen days prior to the hearing. \nApplicant waived the fifteen day notice requirement. (Tr at 12-13.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, received by DOHA on August 5, 2008, Applicant \nadmitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c \u2013 1.e, 2.c - 2.e, 3.c, and 3.h. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, and 3.d \u2013 3.h.    \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old systems analyst employed by a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has worked for his current \nemployer since May 2007. He has held a SECRET clearance since 1999. He has a high \nschool diploma and three semesters of college credit. He currently attends an online \nuniversity. He served on active duty in the United States Army for eight years from 1997 \n\u2013 2004. Applicant married in September 2000 and divorced in 2002. In 2003, he \nbecame engaged. The engagement ended several years later. He is currently single \nand has no children. (Tr at 6-9, 36, 63; Gov 1; Answer to SOR.)    \n \nApplicant worked as a contractor in Iraq from 2003 \u2013 2004; 2005 \u2013 2006; and \nJuly 2006 to March 2007. (Tr at 36-40; Answer to SOR.)   \n \nFrom 1997 to 2007, Applicant has been charged with, or investigated for, or cited \nfor several criminal and traffic offenses.  In December 1997, he was arrested and \ncharged with Theft of Private Property. He was caught shoplifting a leather jacket, \nvalued at $475, from a department store. He was on active duty in the U.S. Army at the \ntime. He pled guilty and was sentenced to pay a $350 fine, $184.23 in court costs, \nattend a life skills offender program, and nine months community supervision. (Tr at 34; \nGov 2 at 8; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 4 at 2 \u2013 7; Gov 7.) Applicant\u2019s security clearance was \nrevoked in October 1998. His security clearance was reinstated nine months later after \nhe completed his community supervison. (Tr at 34; Gov 6.) \n \nIn February 2000, Applicant was stationed in South Korea. On February 12, \n2000, he was walking home with friends after the bars closed.  He and his friends \nexchanged words with a couple. The woman smacked him. The husband threw a punch \nat him. Applicant hit the husband and knocked him out. He was taken to the police \nstation for assault and battery. He was questioned and released to his military unit. His \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncommander referred him to anger management and he was given an oral reprimand.  \n(Tr at 35-36, 42-43; Gov 8; Response to SOR.)       \n \nOn August 9, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving While \nLicense Suspended/Revoked. His car was stopped for traffic violations. It was \ndiscovered that his license was revoked. He was arrested and taken to jail. On \nNovember 5, 2001, Applicant appeared in court and pled guilty to Criminal Attempt of \nDriving While License Suspended. He was sentenced to a $200 fine and ordered to pay \n$69.25 in court costs.  (Tr at 36; Gov 4 at 9 \u2013 12; Gov 9; Answer to SOR.)  \n \nIn June 2002, Applicant was cited for Parked in a Disabled Space. He was fined \n$372. (Tr at 38; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 5 at 2, 13; Answer to SOR.) He admits to parking in a \ndisable space at a grocery store. (Tr at 38.)  \n \nOn May 1, 2004, Applicant was pulled over for a traffic violation. He had just \npurchased the car and was unable to produce the insurance paperwork or the car\u2019s \ntemporary tags. He was charged with Expired License Plates, a misdemeanor, and \nFailure to Maintain Financial Responsibility, a misdemeanor. He was found guilty of \nFailure to Maintain Financial Responsibility and fined $307. (Tr at 37; Gov 2 at 8-9; Gov \n3 at 5; Gov 4 at 13 \u2013 14; Gov 5 at 2, 8 \u2013 11; Answer to SOR.) \n \nOn May 5, 2006, Applicant went to his best friend\u2019s apartment complex to attend \nhis best friend\u2019s birthday party.  He parked his car in a fire zone. At around 11:45 pm, \nthe party attendees were getting ready to go out. They were drinking champagne in the \nparking lot.  One of Applicant\u2019s female friends turned up the radio volume in his car. An \noff-duty police officer who worked part-time as a security officer in the apartment \ncomplex approached the group due to the loud noise. He asked for the identity of all \nfour individuals. It was discovered that Applicant had an outstanding warrant for issuing \nin bad check in October 2004.  He was arrested for the bad check offense. He was also \ncited for Loud Noise, Parking in a Fire Zone, and Open Container.  He paid a total of \n$1,015 in fines; $590 for Loud Noise, $135 for Parking in a Fire Zone, and $290 for \nOpen Container.  On March 2, 2007, the bad check offense was dismissed because \nApplicant paid restitution. (Tr at 38-39; Gov 2 at 9-10; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 4 at 15-16; Gov 5 \nat 2, 5 -7; Gov 10.)   \n \nApplicant denies writing the bad check which is the basis for the bad check \noffense in October 2004. Although he has two checking accounts, he claims that he \nnever writes checks. In 1997, he was the victim of identity theft. A mechanic stole his \nidentity and charged approximately $20,000 in Applicant\u2019s name. He believes the bad \ncheck charge is related to the identity theft. (Tr at 48, 57-58; Gov 3 at 5; Answer to \nSOR.) \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant was cited for Speeding in a School Zone and Failure to \nMaintain Financial Responsibility. He paid a $133 fine. (Tr at 39; Gov 5 at 2-4.) \nAppellant has not been arrested since May 2006. He has received a traffic ticket. In July \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2008, he was cited for speeding and expired tags in July 2008. He paid an $86 fine. (Tr \nat 64-65.) \n \nOn July 20, 2006, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to \u201cSection 23. Your Police Record: For this item report \ninformation regardless of whether the report in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or stricken \nfrom the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions \nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. f. In the last \n7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not \nlisted in response to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 \nunless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d He did not list the offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 2.c and 2.d.   \n \nOn the same e-QIP application, Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to \u201cSection \n27. Your Financial Record. B. In the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished \nor had any property repossessed for any reason?\u201d Applicant\u2019s background investigation \nrevealed that he had an automobile repossessed in December 2005. He owes \napproximately $10,398 on the account. (SOR \u00b6 3.c: Gov 11 at 6; Gov 12 at 2.)  \n \nApplicant claims that he did not intend to falsify his security clearance \nquestionnaire. He claims he did not recall his past arrests and the automobile \nrepossession when completing his security clearance questionnaire. (Gov 3 at 6.)  He \ncompleted his security clearance questionnaire while he was in Iraq in July 2006. He \nclaims he only had 30 minutes on the computer and the Internet was not very stable. He \nhad to try three or four times to get in the program. He didn\u2019t have any paperwork with \nhim so he did not remember everything on his credit report and his \u201cproblems with \nauthorities.\u201d He was feeling pressure to turn the application in to his company so he \nsubmitted the questionnaire. (Tr at 39-40, 45-47.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed additional delinquent accounts \nincluding a $4 cell phone account placed for collection in August 2003 (SOR \u00b6 3.a: Gov \n11 at 10); a $460 internet account placed for collection in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 3.b: Gov \n11 at 9; Gov 12 at 2); a $660 credit card account charged off in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 \n3.d: Gov 11 at 5; Gov 12 at 2); a $130 account placed for collection in June 2005 (SOR \n\u00b6 3.e: Gov 12 at 2); a $349 utility bill charged off in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 3.f: Gov 12 at \n2); a $156 cable bill placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 3.g: Gov 12 at 2); and \na $7,026 account owed to an online university, placed for collection in September 2007 \n(SOR \u00b6 3.h: Gov 12 at 2.).    \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant states that he incurred the delinquent debt \nbecause he relied on his fiance to pay his bills while he was in Iraq. She did not pay all \nof his bills. Applicant indicates that he made over $500,000 since 2002 and has paid off \nall of his debts with the exception of the automobile repossession. He indicated that he \nwas currently paying on the repossession alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.c. (Answer to SOR.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAt hearing, Applicant claims that he paid off all debts with the exception of SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.h.  The debt in SOR \u00b6 3.c is the automobile repossession. He let his fianc\u00e9 \nuse the car during his first deployment to Iraq. She had problems with it. Upon his return \nin 2005, he discovered the car had a lot of mechanical problems so he returned it to the \nlien holder. (Tr at 40-41.) Despite claiming that he was making payments towards the \nrepossession in his answer to the SOR, Applicant has not contacted the creditor about \nmaking payments. He is not making payments because he feels like \u2018they screwed me \nover.\u2019 (Tr at 54-55.)  \n \nWhile in Iraq in 2007, Applicant enrolled in an online university. He believed that \nthe GI Bill covered his tuition. He did not understand how the GI Bill worked. He was \nenrolled in online courses when he was in Iraq and had to drop the course when he \nreturned to the U.S. He owes $7,026 in tuition to the online university. (SOR \u00b6 3.h.) He \nhas been paying $400 a month towards this debt since July 2008. (Tr at 47-48; 55-58.)  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant did not have documentation verifying that he paid off the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, and 3.g. He also did not have \ndocumentation verifying that he was paying $400 a month to the online university for the \ndebt owed them in SOR \u00b6 3.h. The record was held open in order to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documentation. No additional documentation was received.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $4,192 (AE B at 2: assuming \nApplicant is paid twice a month.) His monthly expenses include rent $1,130, electric \n$100, gas for automobile $400, car insurance $170, cable $130, cell phone $80 and \nstorage $70.  His total monthly expenses are $2,080. After expenses, he has $2,112 left \nover each month. He has one open credit card account with a $300 balance that he \npays off each month. He is current on taxes. He owns two cars a 2002 Suburban and \n2002 Cadillac. Both are paid off. (Tr at 59 \u2013 65.) A personal financial statement \nprepared on November 21, 2007, indicated that Applicant had $1,000 in savings, and \n$18,000 in stocks and bonds. (Gov 2 at 5.)   \n \nApplicant separated from the U.S. Army as a staff sergeant. He received an \nhonorable discharge. His awards and decorations include the Army Commendation \nMedal, Army Achievement Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global \nWar on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, Noncommissioned Officer\u2019s Professional Development Ribbon and the Army \nService Ribbon. (AE A.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply. Between \nDecember 1997 and May 2006, Applicant was arrested on five occasions. While \nApplicant was administratively punished for the assault incident which occurred while he \nwas on active duty stationed in South Korea, he did commit an assault and was taken to \nthe police station even though he was never formally charged.   \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence by way of exhibits and testimony \nto raise CC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSeptember 22, 2005.)   \n   \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not \napply. Considering Applicant\u2019s arrest history, not enough time has elapsed to conclude \nthat such conduct no longer casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or \ngood judgment.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) has the potential to apply. While it has been two years since \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest in May 2006, concerns remain based on Applicant\u2019s lack of \ncandor about his arrest history on his security clearance questionnaire.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n8 \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omissions on his July 20, 2006, e-QIP application raises the potential \napplication of Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities).  With respect to omitting his arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d and \n1.e in response to section 23(f) on his security clearance questionnaire, I find \nApplicant\u2019s omission was deliberate. Applicant claims that he did not recall all of his \narrests when completing his security clearance questionnaire. He claims it was difficult \nto complete the application while in Iraq and that he just answered \u201cNo\u201d to complete the \napplication. He admitted at hearing that he remembers his May 2006 arrest for Issuance \nof Bad Check. He was handcuffed and taken to the station. The arrest occurred less \nthan two months prior to completing the security clearance application. I do not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not answering , \u201cyes\u201d to section 23(f) credible.  I find for \nApplicant with respect to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. My basis for doing so, is \nthat these do not appear to be criminal offenses. Applicant was cited as opposed to \ncharged. Each offense appears to be civil in nature.   \n \n \nApplicant deliberately withheld the automobile repossession alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b \nin response to section 27(b). Based on his detailed description at hearing, Applicant \nclearly remembered this incident. I do not find his explanation for omitting this \nrepossession in response to section 27(b) credible. \n   \n \nPC DC \u00b6 16 (d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is \nnot limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rules violations.) applies \nwith respect to Applicant\u2019s traffic offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e. Applicant \nhas a consistent pattern of rules violations which raise questions about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness and reliability.  His lack of candor in completing his security clearance \nquestionnaire raises further issues pertaining to his trustworthiness.   \n \n \n  \n \nPC DC 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. It is reasonable to conclude that \nApplicant did not want to disclose his past criminal offenses when completing his \n\n \n9 \n \n \nsecurity clearance questionnaire because of the adverse affect it might have on getting \na security clearance as well as the potential that he could lose his job. Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent arrest was two months prior to completing his security clearance questionnaire.   \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern may be mitigated.  The following Personal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply because Applicant did not disclose his arrest record or the automobile \nrepossession until he was confronted with the facts during the interview conducted \nduring his background investigation. If he was having problems completing the \nquestionnaire, he could have informed his facility security officer (FSO) that he \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to section 23(f) and section 27(b) due to computer problems. He could \nhave informed the FSO of the correct information.    \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) does not apply.  The record reveals a ten-year history of \nquestionable conduct by Applicant. His failure to be forthcoming about his past conduct \ncontinues to raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) does not apply. Although \nApplicant\u2019s arrest history and financial problems were uncovered during his background \ninvestigation, the information was gathered from independent sources as opposed to \nApplicant.  His lack of candor makes him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation or \nduress.   \n \n \nNone of the other PC MCs are relevant to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. He has \nnot mitigated the concerns raised under personal conduct.  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  Applicant accumulated a significant \namount of delinquent debt since 2001. The SOR alleges eight debts, an approximate \ntotal balance of $19,183.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. The following Financial Considerations \nMitigating Conditions (FC MC) potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. While Applicant \nclaims he resolved all of the accounts with the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.c and 3.h, he did \nnot provide proof that the debts were resolved. Applicant has the burden to prove that \nhis debts have been resolved. Applicant\u2019s failure to prove that the debts are resolved \nraise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Although Applicant \ndivorced in 2001, he did not describe the financial impact his divorce had on his \nfinances. Between 2003 to March 2007, Applicant earned good money as a contractor \nin Iraq. His financial problems are the result of financial irresponsibility as opposed to \ncircumstances beyond his control.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. Although he \nclaims that majority of the debts were paid, he provided no verification that the debts \nwere resolved.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant claims that most of \nthe debts are paid, it was his burden to provide proof that he resolved the accounts. He \nindicated that he was making $400 monthly payments towards the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.h since July 2008. The record was held open to allow Applicant to submit \ndocuments verifying payment. No documents were submitted. For these reasons, I \ncannot conclude Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and his record of no subsequent criminal arrests for over a period of two years.  \nHowever, he continues to be cited for traffic infractions, the most recent incident \noccurring in July 2008. Considering his history of criminal and traffic offenses, not \nenough time has passed to mitigate the concerns raised under Guideline J or Guideline \nE. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his arrest history and automobile repossession on \nhis security clearance questionnaire raises further doubts about his trustworthiness and \nreliability. Although Applicant claims to have resolved the majority of his delinquent \ndebts, he provided no proof verifying repayment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under criminal conduct, personal conduct, and \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2.

MacKinnon, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. His \nstatement of reasons (SOR) listed 25 delinquent debts totaling about $155,000. He paid \nfive SOR debts totaling about $3,300. He disputed two debts totaling about $5,500. He \nhas a payment plan on his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) debt and state tax debt, \ntotaling about $60,000. He has not made sufficient progress resolving about $80,000 of \nremaining delinquent debt. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 10, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86), \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On September 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to \ndeny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n                                           \nJanuary 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn January 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March \n12, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 16, 2009. On March 18, 2009, DOHA \nissued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 7, 2009. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17), and \nApplicant offered 13 exhibits (AE A-M; Tr. 18-21). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GEs 1-6 and AE A-M (Tr. 17, 21, 98-99). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on April \n14, 2009. The record was held open until April 28, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence (Tr. 82, 97, 99). On April 28, 2009, I received three telefaxes from \nApplicant AE N (14 pages), AE O (four pages) and AE P (8 pages).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for 21 of the 25 debts \nlisted in the SOR. He said he paid three of the remaining 21 delinquent debts, and one \ndebt was in a payment plan. He did not address resolution of the 17 remaining debts \ntotaling about $87,000 with specificity about when payments were made or in what \namounts. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old (Tr. 6). He graduated from high school in 1989 (Tr. 6). \nHis six children (including adopted children, step children and foster children) were born \nin 1987, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996, and 1999 (Tr. 89; GE 1). He completed three years of \ncollege (Tr. 6). He has not served in the military (Tr. 6). In 2003, he received a score of \n83 out of 100 points on a police department examination (AE E). He has previously held \na public trust position for several years; however, he has not held a security clearance \n(Tr. 23). His spouse does not work outside their home (Tr. 89). Applicant\u2019s daughter \nwas admitted to a hospital in 2006 and 2007 for her severe asthma (Tr. 34). Insurance \ncompanies paid her medical expenses, which amounted to about a million dollars (Tr. \n35). In December 2006, Applicant discovered that his spouse was having an affair (Tr. \n35). Applicant received counseling to assist him with the stress from his daughter\u2019s \nillness and his spouse\u2019s infidelity (Tr. 35).   \n \nApplicant has an impressive professional career spanning 16 years of \ninformation technology experience, supporting the federal government. He is now a \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n                                           \nsenior software engineer and architect (AE F at 5). He is a Microsoft Certified \nProfessional and Application Developer (AE J). He has trained, led and instructed \nothers on software development and information technology utilization (AE F at 5). He \nprovided an extremely detailed resume, which lists his training, work assignments, and \naccomplishments from 1992 to the present (AE G at 1-21). His current essential duties \nand responsibilities, including designing and completion of complex projects, show an \nimpressive ability to document and organize complex endeavors (AE H at 1-11). His \nProject Completion Forms document Applicant\u2019s extraordinary ability to plan, lead \nteams, and accomplish highly complex goals (AE I at 1-42). He has established that he \nis dedicated, intelligent, hard working, and goal oriented with superb attention to detail \n(AE F-I). He has impressed his supervisors and customers with his duty performance, \ninitiative and professionalism (AE K). He made substantial contributions to mission \naccomplishment (AE K, L, M). He volunteers as a health care worker (AE F at 1). He \nalso volunteered his assistance at the 2009 Presidential Inauguration (AE F at 3-4).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application indicates he has never been arrested \nor charged with any crime (GE 1). In the last seven years, he has not used any illegal \ndrugs (GE 1). In the last seven years, he has not received treatment or counseling for \nalcohol or drug abuse (GE 1). He candidly disclosed a variety of financial problems on \nhis 2006 security clearance application (GE 1). \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant conceded he had ten years of bad credit, but believed he has acted \nresponsibly to remedy his credit during the last two years (Tr. 96). In the late 1990s, \nApplicant began to fall behind on his debts (Tr. 45). Other debts became delinquent in \n2001 and 2002 (Tr. 45).  Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories on November 7, \n2007, indicated the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.d were paid (GE 5 at 2), the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.n were not his debts (GE 5 at 3, 6), payment arrangements were made or \nbeing made on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.q and 1.u (GE 5 at 3, 4, 10), and no action was taken on \nthe remaining SOR debts (GE 5 at 4-13).   \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($3,500) became delinquent in 2001 or 2002, when \nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed (Tr. 45). He provided a printout he made showing \none payment on this debt made on March 6, 2009; however, he did not provide the \namount of this payment (AE N at 8). \n \nApplicant\u2019s apartment complex obtained four judgments against him: SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($210); SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,823); SOR \u00b6 1.d ($132), and a non-SOR2 judgment for $2,385 \n(which appears on his February 2009 credit report) (Tr. 50, 54-55; GE 4). Applicant \ncontended the three SOR judgments were paid via a garnishment for $1,817 and the \ncredit report alleging these multiple debt was erroneous (Tr. 51, 53-55; AE A; AE C at \n2). Applicant provided a garnishment writ for the SOR creditor in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.d, \nshowing a judgment for $1,817 plus costs and fees for a total of $1,871, dated June 12, \n \n2The non-SOR debt is not alleged in the SOR. I decline to draw any adverse inference against \nApplicant because of lack of notice. \n\n \n \n4 \n2007 (AE A at 2). He provided sufficient corroboration to establish that a garnishment of \n$1,871 was paid (AE C at 2).  \n \nApplicant disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,204) and SOR \u00b6 1.n ($3,331); \nhowever, he did not provide a copy of the documentation concerning his disputes (Tr. \n56, 63-65). He also disputed the rationale for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.v ($400) being on his \ncredit report because it was over 10 years old (Tr. 69). A February 2009 credit report \nnoted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was disputed and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n did not appear on \nthis credit report (Tr. 57, 65; GE 4). \n \nApplicant said he paid the college debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($321) (Tr. 58). Applicant \nwas allowed to continue to attend college, manifesting that the college was satisfied the \ndebt was paid or satisfied (Tr. 59). After his hearing, he provided proof of a payment \nmade on March 20, 2009 (AE N at 9). \n \nApplicant owes a relative $16,800 for a judgment she obtained against him \nbecause of a dispute over residential rent he owed her (SOR \u00b6 1.l; Tr. 71). Applicant \nwithheld the rent because of lack of repairs (Tr. 71-72). His relative evicted him and \nobtained a judgment (Tr. 72). He asked his relative for a letter about the debt\u2019s status \nfor his security clearance hearing, and the relative declined because she claimed he \nhad not paid her enough to warrant a letter of support about resolving the debt (Tr. 72-\n76). He said he made some payments to the relative in cash and did not have proof of \nsuch payments (Tr. 75). \n \nApplicant said he made random payments over the years on most of his \nundisputed SOR debts, but the payments were not substantial (Tr. 47). He did not have \nproof of the payments at his hearing (Tr. 47). He said he started to address the debts in \n2006 and 2007 (Tr. 47, 57-58). He said if the creditor contacted him in the last two \nyears, he has been making some payments to resolve the debt (Tr. 62, 65, 68, 70). On \nsome accounts, such as the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($2,040), he did not take any \naction (Tr. 63).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s largest debt is to the IRS for approximately $58,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.q). IRS \nletters, dated March 23, 2009, show that he owes $51,192: (1) $13,544 for tax year \n1997 (AE D at 1); (2) $29,619 for tax year 1998 (AE D at 3); and (3) $8,029 for tax year \n2005 (AE D at 2). The tax lien and judgment resulted from his failure to pay sufficient \ntaxes in 1995, 1997 and 2005 (Tr. 28-29; AE D). Applicant has been paying this IRS \ndebt since January 2007 and he continues to pay $500 a month towards this debt in \nresponse to an IRS levy (Tr. 32, 33, 37; AE B at 1, 2; AE N at 3-5, 10, 12, 13, 14). Last \nyear, Applicant paid $6,000 towards this IRS debt (Tr. 32; AE C at 1). Applicant\u2019s 2007 \npay statement shows payment of $3,271 for this IRS debt (Tr. 38; AE C at 2).  \n \nApplicant did not make payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.r ($33,211) because it \nwas more than seven years old (Tr. 67). He contended he was no longer responsible for \nthis debt because it had \u201cdropped off\u201d of his credit report (Tr. 67). \n    \n\n \n \n5 \nApplicant provided a garnishment writ for a non-SOR creditor, showing a \njudgment for $853 plus costs and fees for a total of $1,021, dated June 5, 2007 (AE A at \n1). He provided a notice of satisfaction of this lien, dated September 18, 2007 (AE A at \n4). SOR creditor in \u00b6 1.x lists a debt for $851. I assume these are the same debt and \nthat the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.x was paid through garnishment. \n \nIn 2008, Applicant\u2019s gross income was $103,019 (W2, AE C at 1). Applicant said \nthat beginning in 2007, when he received a bill from a creditor, he would enter that debt \ninto his electronic bill paying system (Tr. 27). Unfortunately, he did not bring the printout \nof his debts to his hearing (Tr. 27). He also sent each creditor a letter promising to make \npayments every month (Tr. 27). He promised to provide the printout later (Tr. 27-28). As \nindicated previously, Applicant said, every creditor who recently billed him receives an \nautomatic check from Applicant, every pay period, anywhere between $5 and $20 (Tr. \n48). After his hearing he provided a four-page printout showing payments made to \nvarious creditors from May 7, 2008, to March 20, 2009 (AE N at 6-9). Most of the \npayments on the printout were to a telecommunications company and for gas and \nelectric utilities, water, student loan and education costs at a university. He also \nfrequently made payments to a loan servicing center, a reality company and about five \ncollection agencies received one or two payments, mostly in February and March 2009 \n(AE N at 8-9). Two SOR-listed creditors received one payment each (creditors in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.h). Of course, an SOR-listed creditor may have transferred a debt to one of \nthe creditors on the list that is receiving a payment. At the hearing, I specified that \nApplicant should annotate the printout showing the SOR paragraph of the pertinent \ncreditor (Tr. 79-80). However, the printout was devoid of references to the SOR \nparagraphs.  \n \nIn addition to his printout, Department counsel requested that Applicant provide \nmonthly bank statements showing funds leaving his account and payments to particular \nSOR creditors (Tr. 80-81). Applicant responded that he could provide bank statements \nwith annotations in the margins showing his payments to the various creditors listed in \nthe SOR (Tr. 79-80, 88). However, Applicant did not provide any bank account \nstatements after his hearing.  \n \nApplicant said it was his impression that he was making monthly overpayments \non his state tax debt of $9,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) (Tr. 39-41). He provided a printout he \ngenerated showing payments on his state tax debt on February 6 and 20, 2009 and \nMarch 6 and 20, 2009 (Tr. 39-41; AE N at 7-9). The printout he generated apparently \nshowed some transaction fees or minimal payments on these four dates, but it was \nunclear how much was paid on his state tax debt (AE N at 7-9).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current gross income is $120,000 (Tr. 89). His monthly rent is $2,500 \n(Tr. 89). I emphasized to Applicant the importance of providing proof that he was \nmaking payments to the SOR creditors prior to close of the record on April 21, 2009, \nand Applicant indicated he understood this requirement (Tr. 97-98). \n  \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n \n7 \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, in his SOR \nresponse and at his hearing. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. His SOR listed 25 delinquent debts totaling about $155,000. He paid \nfive SOR debts totaling about $3,300 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, 1.h, and 1.x). He disputed two \ndebts totaling about $5,500 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.n). He has a payment plan on his \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) debt and state tax debt; however, about $60,000 \nremains to be paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q). He has not made sufficient progress resolving \nabout $80,000 of remaining delinquent debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i to 1.m, 1.o, 1.r to \n1.t, 1.v, 1.w, and 1.y) His financial difficulties began in the late 1990s and continue \ntoday. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n \n8 \n                                           \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives partial \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because his financial problems \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur;\u201d however, there is some residual doubt \nabout whether he is fully committed to resolving his delinquent SOR debts and is \nmaking adequate steps to do so. He realizes the importance of avoiding delinquent debt \nand promised to make a greater effort to keep his debts current.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged due in \npart to his marital problems and stress from his daughter\u2019s illness. He has six children, \nand lives in a high cost area. He lacked the income to pay some of his debts. He does \nnot receive full credit because many of his debts arose years ago, and he made little \nprogress on most of them until his pay was garnished, judgments, liens or levies were \nfiled against him. He established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nwith respect to the debts he actually paid, through compliance with the garnishment \norders, or through reaching settlements with creditors, such as the IRS.3  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant is a very intelligent, well organized, goal \noriented person. He does not really need financial counseling or advice to resolve his \ndebts. He manages to make payments on most of his non-SOR debts. Applicant has \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n\n \n \n9 \n                                           \ntaken positive action to pay five SOR debts. He is making payments of $500 monthly on \nhis IRS debt. He is also making some payments on his state tax debt, and his $460 debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.u). He did not prove he had agreements with most of his creditors to accept \nminimal payments to resolve the other SOR debts. There are some positive \u201cindications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He understands the security \nimplications of delinquent debt and there are positive signs that he will avoid future \ndelinquent debt. He has also established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because \nApplicant showed some good faith4 in the resolution of his SOR debts.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies because Applicant disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,204) \nand SOR \u00b6 1.n ($3,331). Although he did not provide a copy of the documentation \nconcerning these two disputes, his February 2009 credit report noted the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e was disputed and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n did not appear on this credit report. He also \ndisputed the rationale for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.v ($400) being on his credit report \nbecause it was over 10 years old. However, the age of the debt and whether or not it is \non a credit report, without more, is not a valid basis for asserting mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(e) for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.v.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His payment of five SOR debts, his payment \nplans to resolve three debts, and his dispute of two debts, are simply inadequate to fully \nmitigate financial considerations security concerns. Applicant has not adequately \naddressed about 15 delinquent SOR debts, totaling about $80,000. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant deserves substantial credit for his support to his \ncountry and his family. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States, the \nDepartment of Defense, his employer and that he is an honorable person. There were \nno allegations of security violations. He does not have any arrests or convictions. \nApplicant is a high school graduate, and has three years of college. He was not \nsophisticated in the area of finance, and made mistakes years ago, and his debts \nbecame delinquent. Stress from marital problems, support of his six children, and his \ndaughter\u2019s medical problems contributed to his financial woes. He understands how to \navoid future delinquent debts. He paid several non-SOR debts and is current on many \nof his financial responsibilities. He paid five SOR debts, $10,000 towards his IRS debt in \nthe last two years, and is making payments on his state tax debt and one other SOR \ndebt. He is making some progress on his way to establishing a meaningful track record \nof debt repayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). He is \nmotivated to have a successful career as an employee of a Department of Defense \ncontractor, to pay his delinquent debts and to have his security clearance approved. \nThese factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems. He began to have \nfinancial difficulties in the late 1990s, when several debts became delinquent. On \nNovember 7, 2007, he received DOHA interrogatories and on January 12, 2009, he \nresponded to the SOR. He had ample opportunity to contact more of his SOR creditors \nand to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. Of the 25 SOR debts, \ntotaling about $156,000, he provided documentary proof that he paid about $10,000 to \nthe IRS and about $2,500 as required by two garnishments. He paid one non-\ngarnishment, non-tax debt for $321 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). He is evidently making payments on \nhis state tax debt, and another state-related debt (SOR \u00b6 1.u, $460). Applicant\u2019s current \ngross income is $120,000, and was over $100,000 the previous year. He made \ninsufficient progress over the last 18 months to resolve his delinquent debts, even \nthough he had steady employment and ample opportunity to contact his creditors and \nprovide documentation. He provided voluminous documentation showing his superb \n\n \n \n11 \nbackground in information technology and software development. He knows how to \ngenerate a comprehensive, thorough report showing his financial situation and to \ndocument progress in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. He was on clear \nnotice from his receipt of DOHA interrogatories and even more so after he received the \nSOR that he needed to show substantial progress in the resolution of his delinquent \ndebts; however, he made insufficient effort to accomplish this security responsibility.      \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s delinquent SOR debts are paid, resolved or otherwise satisfied, \nand after a reasonable period of time without additional delinquent debts, (assuming no \nother disqualifying conditions surface), Applicant\u2019s access to classified information \nshould be approved. He needs to provide documentary evidence, such as bank \nstatements, or other receipts, to corroborate resolution of his debts. He needs some \ntime after his SOR debts are paid to reestablish a track record of financial responsibility.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set \nforth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of \nthe whole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent \nfactors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s \ncase. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified \ninformation at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.e: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i to 1.m: \n Against Applicant   \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p and 1.q: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r to 1.t:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.v and 1.w: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \n Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n12 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

On October 31, 2007, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on December 19, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non January 24, 2008.  I received the case assignment on January 25, 2008.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on February 6, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on March 4, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits 1 through\n\n2\n4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing, and the record closed, on March 14, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 46, single and is a retired non-commissioned officer in the\nArmed Forces.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security\nclearance previously granted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant retired from the Armed Forces in November 2001 as an E-7.  He\nworked for a Defense contractor until July 2002.  During 2002 and 2003 the Applicant\nattempted to make a living as a real estate agent.  During this time he incurred the\nmajority of the debt discussed below, but was able to maintain at least minimum\npayments using his retirement pay and savings he had accumulated during his military\ncareer.\nIn 2004 the Applicant was not making any money as a realtor and he had also\nexhausted his savings.  At this point he stopped incurring new debt and attempted to\nfind full-time employment.  He worked at several part time jobs from December 2003 to\nJune 2006.  None of these jobs paid well or matured into full-time employment.  During\nthis period he was able to maintain his monthly expenses, but was unable to make any\npayments on his now past-due indebtedness.  (Transcript at 33-39; Government Exhibit\n2 at 1, 6-8.)\nThe Applicant began work as a full-time employee for a Defense contractor in\nJune 2006.  Almost immediately upon beginning work, the Applicant began paying off\nhis past-due indebtedness.  In July 2006, he paid off his smallest bill, to his cable\ncompany, in the amount of $104.14.  Next, he began paying off his American Express\nbill.  This debt, in the amount of $4,043.07, was paid off in February 2007.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 17-20, and Government Exhibit 3 at 2.)    \nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owes approximately $15,635.00\non this credit card account.  This debt was incurred during the time he was working full-\ntime in real estate.  His financial situation has improved to the point where he can make\npayment arrangements on this debt.  In order to facilitate this, the Applicant has entered\ninto an agreement with a debt resolution company (Company).  The payments to the\nCompany begin in March 2008 and the Applicant expects this debt to be paid within a\nyear.  His current income allows him to complete the payments set forth under\nsubparagraph 1.c., below, and make the required payments to the Company.\n(Transcript at 51-55; Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and C at 1-13.)\n\n3\nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owes approximately $36,397.00\non this credit card account.  His financial situation has improved to the point where he\ncan make payment arrangements on this debt.  In order to facilitate this, the Applicant\nhas entered into an agreement with a debt resolution company (Company).  The\npayments to the Company begin in March 2008 and the Applicant expects this debt to\nbe paid within 18 months.  His current income allows him to complete the payments set\nforth under subparagraph 1.c., below, and make the required payments to the\nCompany.  (Ibid.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits that he originally owed $21,997.00 on\nthis past due credit card debt.  Once he completed paying American Express in\nFebruary 2007 the Applicant immediately began paying $1,542.25 per month on this\naccount.  As of the date of the hearing his balance was approximately $9,200.  The\ncollection agency debits the amount automatically from the Applicant\u2019s account every\nmonth.  (Transcript at 49-51; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 1, 15-29.)  \nAs of the date of the hearing he had paid $18,447.36 towards this particular debt.\nSince June 19, 2006, when he obtained permanent employment, the Applicant has paid\noff $22,594.57 towards all of his past due debts.   \nMitigation\nThe Applicant had a very successful military career.  He submitted his resume,\nwhich showed that he was a respected non-commissioned officer.  (Government Exhibit\n2 at 9-13.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\n\n5\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b. and 1.c.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ The Applicant\nattempted to begin a career in real estate after leaving the Armed Forces.  For a time he\nwas able to use credit cards, his retirement pay, and his savings to pay his debts.\nWhen he was unable to make his payments he stopped using the credit cards, and\nwhen he obtained full time employment he immediately went to work paying them off.  I\nfind the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur,\nand it does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition.  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control.\u201d  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).\nThe Applicant is able to pay his current bills and also pay close to $3,000.00 a month\ntowards the older debts.  He has control over his current indebtedness and, for a year\nand a half, has paid a substantial amount of money towards the arrearage.  I conclude\nthese potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant attempted to succeed\nin the real estate business after he left the military.  For reasons not of his making he\nwas unsuccessful.  For several years he was unemployed or underemployed and\nunable to make payments on his past due debts.  Once he was employed full time he\n\n6\nimmediately began to pay his debts and has already paid a substantial amount towards\nthem.  He has a plan to pay all of his debts and is fulfilling it.  He has behaved\nreasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve them, thereby AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of\nrecurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on July 28, 2008, denied\nall SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without a\nhearing.  On August 29, 2008, Department Counsel, pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the\nAdditional Procedural Guidance at Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6, requested a\nhearing. Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nDecember 30, 2008\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on September 17, 2008. A notice of hearing was\nissued on October 6, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 22, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified but did not submit any documentary exhibits. The record was held open\nto provide Applicant the opportunity to submit documentation in support of his case. Nine\ndocuments were timely received, marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-9 and admitted into\nthe record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was marked\nas App. Ex. II and is included in the file. The transcript was received on November 6, 2008.\n   \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 48 years old. He graduated from high school in 1979 and has been\nemployed as a machine repairman by a defense contractor since 1981. He was laid off by\nthis defense contractor from June 2003 to December 2004, during which time he supported\nhimself from his savings. He has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant was married in November 1981. The marriage ended by divorce in either\nMarch 1998 or March 1999. He has two daughters from the marriage, ages 20 and 26.\nUntil recently, the younger daughter resided with him and was primarily supported by him.\nThe SOR lists 16 accounts that have either been charged off as bad debts or\nsubmitted for collection. The debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a is a medical account\nowing in the amount of $150 with a listed date of last activity of June 2006. (GE 5)\nApplicant does not recognize this account but acknowledges it may be a charge for\nmedical care received by his daughter that should have been paid by his ex-wife but was\nnot. (Tr. pp. 37-39) He credibly testified he will pay this debt if he gets a bill from the\ncreditor and his ex-wife doesn\u2019t pay it. (Tr. p. 40)\nThe last activity on the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.f and 1.h\nthrough 1.k occurred between December 2000 and November 2001. The last activity for\nthe debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.g, 1.l and 1.m occurred in December 2003,\nNovember 2002, and September 2004, respectively. A review of Applicant\u2019s credit reports\nindicates the last activity on the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.g, 1.l and 1.m  were\ndates when the accounts were purchased by a collection agency. Applicant denies he is\nresponsible for any of these debts. \nApplicant began dating a woman in or about April 2000, and allowed her to move\ninto his home in or about November 2000. Almost immediately thereafter, she stole his\nvehicle and credit cards. He filed a police report on November 8, 2000, in which he\nidentified the woman and reported the theft of the credit cards. (AE 5 & AE 6) Analysis of\nthe dates of last activity on the accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.m and\nthe date Applicant reported the theft of his credit cards strongly corroborates his assertion\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n3\nthat the woman used the stolen credit cards extensively in addition to possibly opening\nother accounts using his name. \nApplicant initially made payment on some of the accounts until he realized the\nextent of her thievery. He also disputed some of the accounts with credit reporting services.\nWhen creditors began to aggressively pursue him, he contacted an attorney. He was\nadvised to make no further payments on the accounts and not to respond or discuss the\naccounts with any creditor who might try to contact him. (Tr. pp. 42-43 and p. 64) Law suits\nhave been filed against him by creditors on three occasions. On each occasion, his\nattorney has gotten the suits dismissed. (AE 4 and AE 7-9)\nApplicant has not used a credit card since about the time his credit cards were\nstolen in 2000. Instead, he either pays cash or uses a debit card attached to his checking\naccount. He earns approximately $70,000 a year, lives within his means, and owns a\nhouse valued at about $170,000, in which he has approximately $110,000 in equity. \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id. at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant is likely jointly responsible with his ex-wife for the $150 medical debt listed\nin SOR subparagraph 1.a. He credibly testified he will pay the debt when and if he receives\na bill his ex-wife does not pay. His testimony, the information contained in his credit\nreports, the police report he filed, and the court records he submitted clearly establish the\nremaining debts resulted from the theft of his credit cards in or about November 2000. He\ncurrently lives within his income and has not relied upon revolving credit since his credit\ncards were stolen. No disqualifying condition applies. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, including Applicant\u2019s appearance and demeanor while testifying,\nthe corroborating evidence he submitted, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the\nDirective, and the lack of any disqualifying condition, I find Applicant has mitigated the\n\n5\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-m:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn November 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 14, 2007, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was assigned to me on December 10, 2007, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 19, 2008.  A hearing was held on February 19, 2008, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nApril 22, 2008\n\n2\nand one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 27, 2008.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access\nclassified information is denied.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated one debt: a credit card debt\nthat resulted in a judgment entered against Applicant in November 2006 for $16,970.00.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged judgment without\nexplanation.  \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old installer for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegation covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant is adopted as\na relevant and material finding.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant accumulated several credit card debts with creditor 1.a between 1996\nand 2002, one in 1996, another in 2000, and a third in 2001 (see exs. 3 and 4).  He\nopened all three accounts while an undergraduate student between 1996 and 2001 (see\nexs. 1 and 3: R.T., at 25-30).  As a college student, he had a low paying job and  used\nthe credit cards for school expenses and dining out with friends.  Once he left school, he\nfell behind in all three of his credit card accounts.  Because of his low income job and\nhigh expenses, he was not able to keep up with the monthly payments.  After\nunsuccessful efforts to obtain reduced monthly payments from the creditor through a\ndebt consolidation service (R.T., at 25-26), he stopped making settlement offers and\nmonthly payments (see ex. 3). \nBy 2006, one of the accounts (the one he opened in 1996) had a high balance of\n$11,000.00 with monthly payments of $300.00 (ex. 3).  Another (i.e., the account he\nopened in 2000) had balance in excess of $6,000.00 (see ex. 4).  With funds he had\nsaved and proceeds from a debt consolidation loan, he was able to negotiate\nsettlements with the creditor on both of the earlier accounts.  He settled the 1996\naccount in 2006 for a lump sum payment of $9,000.00, and the other (also in 2006) for a\nlump sum payment of $6,000.00 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 42-43).  However, he was unable to\nsettle the listed 2001 account with the same creditor.  His lump sum $8,000.00 plus\noffer in 2006 was rejected by this creditor.  By 2006, this debt has accumulated over\n$5,000.00 in interest and fees alone and had a total balance in excess of $16,000.00.\n While Applicant was overseas in 2006,  creditor 1.a filed a complaint to recover\nthe balance owing on the 2001 account in delinquent status (R.T., at 29-30).  When\nApplicant did not answer or respond to the complaint, the creditor obtained a judgment\nagainst him in the amount of $16,970.00.  Applicant assures that he was overseas on a\njob for the better part of 2006 and received no statements or phone calls from his\nparents concerning the debt (R.T., at 30-32). \n\n3\n Not until Applicant returned from his overseas assignment in December 2006 did\nhe learn of creditor 1.a\u2019s entered judgment against him (R.T., at 31).  Records reflect\nthat creditor 1.a obtained a judgment against Applicant in November 2006 (see ex. 5).\nApplicant provided no proof of his ever challenging the judgment, appealing the\njudgment, or satisfying the judgment by either payment in full or completion of a\nsettlement arrangement with the creditor.  So, at this time, the judgment remains\noutstanding and enforceable in its entirety. \n More recently (in February 2007), Applicant made a settlement offer to creditor\n1.a to settle the judgment debt for around $9,000.00, payable over a period of years\n(R.T., at 33).  Creditor 1.a counter-offered with a suggested settlement of $12,000.00,\npayable in two installments of $6,000.00 each (R.T., at 34).  Applicant could not afford\nthe payment terms offered by creditor 1.a and declined the offer (R.T., at 34).\nApplicant nets just $2,620.00 in monthly income (R.T., at 38).  He currently has a\nmonthly remainder after expense deductions of around $1,000.00 (R.T., at 36-38).\nMentally, he has written off the $16,900.00 plus judgment but recognizes it is still\nreported in his credit report.\nApplicant owns no real estate.  He owns approximately $2,000.00 in stocks and\nbonds.  At present, he does not know how he can satisfy creditor 1.a\u2019s judgment, which\nnow exceeds $17,607.00, based on his most recent credit reports (see exs. 4 and 5).\nA considerable percentage of the creditor 1.a judgment reflects interest and fees.\nWithout copies of the pleadings, orders, and the judgment itself, it is not possible to\nbreak down the judgment by principle and interest accrued.  \nApplicant is considered dependable and hardworking by his supervisor and a\ntrusted and reliable team player by a senior co-worker who has worked with Applicant\nfor a number of years (see ex. A).  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial,\ncommon-sense decision.\n\n4\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common-sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversarial proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take into account cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an installer for a defense contractor who accumulated several credit\ncard debts with the same creditor while a college student (between 1996 and 2001).\n\n5\nWhile he was later able to settle two of the accounts with lump sum payments from\nsavings and a consolidation loan, he could not settle the third account.  This delinquent\naccount was subsequently reduced to a judgment which remains unpaid and\noutstanding.  As a large unresolved judgment, the raises  security significant concerns. \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to \u201cindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d and place the\nperson \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  See AG, \u00b6 18.\nThe still outstanding judgment against Applicant and his inability to resolve it warrants\nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19 (a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19 \u00a9), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s judgment debt is attributable in part to immaturity and living beyond\nhis means while a college student. His situation is not sufficient, however, to\ndemonstrate extenuating circumstances sufficient to warrant application of MC 20 (b),\n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d of AG \u00b6 18.\nBecause Applicant\u2019s creditor1.a debt was reduced to judgment and is\nenforceable, it is not subject to any controlling statutes of limitation in Applicant\u2019s state.\nWithout any documented Applicant payment record or arrangement for satisfying the\njudgment, the judgment debt is not mitigated.  Even though Applicant has been able to\nsettle his other debts with this same creditor, the remaining judgment debt is simply too\nlarge  to safely discount and mitigate.   For so long as Applicant is exposed to and\nenforceable judgment, he remains at risk to levies on his bank accounts, personal, and\nany real property he might acquire.  Facing such risk prospects, Applicant will be\nsubject to the financial guideline\u2019s core security concerns: the \u201crisk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  See AG \u00b6 18\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations is insufficient to enable\nApplicant to surmount security concerns independent of the express disqualifying\n\n6\nconditions covered by AG\u00b6 18. He is well regarded by his supervisor and co-workers,\nwhich is to his credit.  And he has shown responsibility in resolving his other credit card\naccounts and debts, based on his latest credit reports.  Without more to demonstrate\nprogress in resolving his large judgment debt, however, it is difficult to draw convincing\nconclusions about his overall trustworthiness based on factors not covered in the\nmitigation conditions of the guideline for financial considerations.   \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ncovered judgment debt and overall presentation of payment histories and\nendorsements, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to his covered\njudgment debt.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegation covered\nby sub-paragraph 1.a of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\n             AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Applicant\u2019s job does not require her to handle \nclassified information, but she needs access to secured working areas to perform her \njob. There is no evidence that Applicant has compromised classified information or that \nshe has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of \nclassified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded her August 2007 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), and the review of \ncredit bureau reports (CBRs) from January 2006 (GE 3), and June 2007 (GE 4). The \nSOR alleges 16 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $37,750. The \nalleged debts are supported by the government\u2019s evidence. At her hearing, consistent \nwith her answers to the SOR and DOHA interrogatories, Applicant confirmed these are \nher debts and they are still outstanding.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to pay or otherwise resolve \nher debts since the day she acquired them. With the exception of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a, for which she entered into a judgment payment agreement, Applicant \npresented no documentary evidence of payments made to any creditors. As of the \nhearing date, she had not made her judgment agreement payment for January. She did \nnot have the money to make the $125 payment because of the higher cost of utilities \nduring winter (Tr. 44). \n \nApplicant raised numerous factors that could be considered mitigating \ncircumstances that prevented her from paying her debts, i.e., being a single mother of \ntwo, inadequate or lack of child support, changing jobs, medical and health problems \n(10 surgeries from 2000-2007), having to support her two adult daughters and their \nbabies, and her daughter\u2019s lack of financial contributions to the household. Applicant \nwas receiving food coupons from her state welfare services, but with the overtime she \nwas making she no longer qualifies for assistance (Tr. 63). Both of her daughters also \nreceived assistance from the state. Applicant plans to move back in with her parents, \nbecause she is losing her eyesight and will not be able to take care of her home alone \n(Tr. 61). She presented little or no evidence, other than her testimony, to corroborate \nher claims. \n \nApplicant claimed her financial problems started in January 2006, when she left \nher assistant manager job for her current job (GE 2, Tr. 56). However, the CBRs reflect \nmany of her delinquent accounts were open in the early 2000s (GE 3-4). Concerning \nher medical/health problems, Applicant testified she has lost a total of approximately \nseven weeks of work as a result of all her surgeries. She received her full salary while \non sick leave, and her health care insurance paid for 80% of the medical bills. She did \nnot established how her health/medical problems affected her ability to pay her debts. \nUltimately, she attributed her financial problems to the higher cost of living.  \n \nOver 90% of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are for credit card \naccounts. Approximately 6% of the debts are related to medical bills. Seven of the \ndelinquent debts listed could be considered small debts because the total owed per \ndebt is less than $1,000. During the last year, Applicant has paid many of her delinquent \nmedical bills by making payments to a collection agency (GEs 3-4). Her plan is to pay \nher medical bills first, and then pay the remaining delinquent debts using her 2008 \nincome tax refund, and by possibly consolidating the debts (Tr. 54). She claimed she \nattempted to consolidate her debts once, but she did not have the money to make the \npayments.  \n \nApplicant stated her willingness to pay her delinquent debts, however, at the \npresent she cannot afford to do so (Tr. 59). She also claimed she considered filing for \nbankruptcy protection, but was afraid doing so would adversely affect her ability to \nobtain a security clearance (Tr. 60). She presented no evidence, other than her \ntestimony to support her claims. Most of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are for overdue \ncredit cards she used to buy clothes and household appliances (Tr. 45). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor considers her behavior and performance exemplary. She \nis honest and professional, and has a good disposition. Her supervisor considers her \ndependable and trustworthy. Because of her performance, Applicant will be entitled to \nfuture pay raises that could assist her to overcome her financial problems. \nNotwithstanding, at the present, her monthly expenses far exceed her monthly income. \nApplicant is not earning enough to pay for her day-to-day living expenses and her debts.  \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of any measures she has taken to avoid future \nfinancial difficulties. She did not seek financial counseling because she believes she \ndoes not need it (Tr. 77). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s  \n \n\u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nApplicant has 16 delinquent debts, including a judgment, that have been charged \noff or in collection for many years, totaling approximately $37,750. AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d), and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means . . .\u201d), apply in \nthis case.  \n \n \nAG & 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), and the record \nevidence as a whole,4 I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant \npresented little evidence of efforts taken to contact creditors, or to resolve any of the \ndebts since she acquired them. Nor is there any evidence that she has participated in \nany financial counseling.  \n \n4  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nI specifically considered AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cThe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), and \nconclude that they apply, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony raised mitigating factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., she \nwas a single mother of two, received inadequate or no child support, changed jobs, had \nmedical and health problems (10 surgeries from 2000-2007), provided financial support \nher two adult daughters and their babies, and her daughter\u2019s do not contributed to the \nhousehold finances.  \n \nThese claims demonstrate circumstances beyond her control; however, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly with her \nfinancial obligations. She presented little evidence to show paid debts, settlement \nagreements, \ndocumented \nnegotiations, \npayment \nplans, \nbudgets, \nfinancial \nassistance/counseling before, or after receipt of the SOR.  \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(d), I considered Applicant is paying a judgment, and that she \nhas been paying another debt collector for some of her medical delinquent debts. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a \nfinding that she has established a track record of financial responsibility. She failed to \nestablish that circumstances beyond her control contributed to her inability to pay her \ndebts, that she received financial counseling, and that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control (AG \u00b6 20(c)). She also failed to show that she properly disputed the \nlegitimacy of any of the debts (AG \u00b6 20(e)). Based on the available evidence, her \nfinancial problems are recent, not isolated, ongoing, and are likely to be a concern in the \nfuture.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a),  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\u201d        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, hard-working \nwoman. She has been successful working as a retail business assistant manager and \nfor a defense contractor. She received a solid recommendation from his current \nsupervisor as a trustworthy and dependable employee. She is a dedicated mother who \ntakes care of her daughters and grandchildren. She has had significant health \nproblems. \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.p:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

He \nalso failed to mitigate the outside activities security concern. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 31 and June 30,1 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence), and Guideline L (Outside Activities).2 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \n \n1  Amendment to the Statement of Reasons. \n \n2  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nFebruary 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be denied or revoked. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 25 and July 16, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 9, 2008, scheduling a hearing \non November 4, 2008. On November 3, 2008, with Applicant\u2019s agreement, I granted the \ngovernment\u2019s request for a continuance. DOHA issued a second notice of hearing on \nNovember 5, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled on November 19, 2008.  \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 44. GEs 1 \nthrough 21, and 23 through 35, were admitted without objection (Tr. 53).3 Applicant \nobjected to GEs 22 and 36 through 43. The government withdrew GE 22 (Tr. 357). I \nconsidered GEs 36 through 43 relevant and material and admitted the documents over \nApplicant\u2019s objections.4 Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented four \nwitnesses and 13 exhibits, marked AE A through M, which were received without \nobjection (Tr. 111). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 2, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.g, 2.a - 2.d, 2.e \n(admitted and denied in part), 2.f, 2.g, 2.h (admitted and denied in part), and 3.a \u2013 3.i, \nwith explanations. He denied, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, 2.i (he failed to answer this \nallegation and I entered a denial), and 3.j. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old entrepreneur and owner of numerous successful \ncompanies, some of which do business with the Department of Defense. He was born, \nraised, and educated in Israel (Tr. 114). After completing high school in 1975, he was \ndrafted into the Israeli Army as an infantry man (Tr. 261). He served three and one-half \nyears and was discharged with the rank of captain (Tr. 116). He was transferred into the \nIsraeli Army reserve forces, but he was never called into service again (Tr. 266).  \n \n \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n3  GE 44 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n4  Applicant\u2019s counsel objected on grounds of relevance and the government\u2019s timeliness in the \nproduction of the documents. Applicant was prepared to proceed as scheduled and did not request a \npostponement. I considered the documents relevant and material, and made them part of the record. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                     \nFrom July 1979 to April 1982, Applicant attended college in Israel, completing a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in economics and international relations (Tr. 121). At the same time, \nhe worked full time for the Israeli Port Authority as a security guard for El-Al, the Israeli \nairline (Tr. 268-269, GE 7). As a security guard, he received training by private \ncontractors, the Israeli National Police and the Israeli General Security Service (now \nknown as the Israeli Security Agency (ISA)) (Tr. 120).5 Applicant became friends with \nfour or five members of the ISA and continued his relationship with some of them until at \nleast 2005 (GE 23). He believes his ISA friends are now retired. In 2005, he met with \none of his ISA friends approximately 10 times for business purposes (GE 23). Applicant \nhas a close personal relationship with another ISA agent (called A) because they \nattended elementary school together. He meets with A for dinner once a year when \nApplicant is in Israel on business (GEs 23 & 32). He denied ever being employed by the \nISA. \n \nHe emigrated to the United States in April 1982 at age 25 (Tr. 121, 269). In 1982, \nApplicant applied for a position as a security guard in the Israeli Embassy in \nWashington, D.C (Tr. 269). He stated he applied for the position seeking to continue his \neducation (Tr. 121). As an Embassy security guard, he received special training from \nhis supervisor and the chief of security at the Embassy who at the time was a general \nofficer in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) (Tr. 123, 274). He worked in that position \naround two and one-half years (Tr. 270). At the same time, he attended a U.S. \nuniversity and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration (Tr. 124).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Argentina and emigrated to Israel at a young age. \nShe grew up and was educated in Israel. He married his wife in 1984 in Israel. Applicant \nand his wife applied for U.S. citizenship in 1988 and became U.S. naturalized citizens in \n1998. They were issued U.S. passports shortly thereafter (Tr. 280).They have four U.S. \nborn children, ages 23, 21, 16 and 14 (Tr. 132). After their births, Applicant registered \nhis children as Israeli citizens at the Israeli Embassy (GE 7). \n \nIn 1984, Applicant was promoted to the position of Embassy research and \ndevelopment assistance defense attach\u00e9 (Tr. 270-274). He served as liaison between \nthe Israeli Embassy and the Department of Defense for approximately two years and \npossessed an Israeli security clearance (Answer to the SOR, GEs 7 & 32). He assisted \nthe Israeli government and defense industry in purchasing and selling products to the \nU.S. government and defense industry. During that same period, he continued his \neducation, and in 1986 he received a master\u2019s in business administration (Tr. 124). \n \nApplicant resigned his position at the Israeli Embassy in 1986 (Tr. 125). In mid-\n1986, he became the head of the Washington office of a company called \u201cS\u201d, which was \na U.S. subsidiary of a large international corporation headquartered in Israel, called \u201cK\u201d \n(Tr. 125, 277-78, 312-13). K\u2019s management knew Applicant from his jobs at the Israeli \nEmbassy and they trusted him to manage their operation in the United States. S was \nattempting to establish a business relationship with the U.S. government and the U.S. \n \n5  ISA received responsibility for the recruitment and training of security guards and members of \nthe security divisions of Israeli airlines in 1968 (GEs 37 & 38). \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndefense industry. His work at S involved selling the company\u2019s security and defense-\nrelated products to the U.S. government and defense contractors. In September 1988, \nK sold S to Applicant in exchange for him taking responsibility of approximately $30,000 \nin liabilities (a rental agreement) (Tr. 126). Applicant paid no money for S. \n \nIn September 1988, Applicant used S to incorporate his own company \u201cM,\u201d in the \nUnited States (Tr. 126). He is M\u2019s sole owner and its key management person (Tr. 302). \nInitially, his company worked in research and development. Now it specializes in \nproviding the U.S. government with technological innovations in anti-terrorism and anti-\ninsurgency developed particularly by Israel and its defense industry (Tr. 127). M sells \nindustrial, defense, and security products to the U.S. government and the defense \nindustry. Applicant\u2019s hard work has paid off, as M has grown significantly and become a \nvery lucrative company working closely with government agencies, the defense \nindustry, and law enforcement agencies.  \n \nM as a prime contractor or subcontractor on contracts with the U.S. government \nand the defense industry, M has direct revenues of approximately $40 million a year, \nwith sales in the several hundred millions of dollars (Tr. 155). Ninety percent of M\u2019s \nrevenues derive from its business with the United States. The company has had Alcohol \nTobacco and Firearms (ATF) licenses to import, and State Department licenses to \nexport, since 1988 with a record free of rules and regulation violations (Tr. 190). A U.S. \nsubsidiary of M provides governments and commercial customers worldwide with \nsecurity products similar to the ones sold to the United States. Its customers include the \ngovernments of Taiwan, Israel, and Greece (GE 35). \n \nM represents and assists Israeli defense manufacturers in developing business, \nand marketing and selling their products to the U.S. government and manufacturers (Tr. \n345). Some of the companies are M\u2019s suppliers, and in turn, M supplies products to the \nU.S. market. M serves as a bridge to the U.S. government and defense industry for \nsystems and technology developed by Israel\u2019s government and defense industry (Tr. \n111). The company has had strong, long-term relationships with approximately 8 to 10 \nIsraeli companies for between four and 20 years (Tr. 217, 319). Some of the companies \nare Israeli government owned companies; others are privately owned companies that \nare also cleared facilities by the Israeli government (Tr. 217).  \n \nApplicant also assists in the day-to-day management of particular programs for a \ncouple of Israeli companies (Tr. 222-223). He encouraged two of his client companies in \nIsrael (PS (Israel) and O) to open U.S. subsidiaries to manufacture and sell their \nproducts directly to their U.S. customers (Tr. 166, 254). As of the hearing day, Applicant \nwas acting president/manager of PS, North America, a U.S. subsidiary of one of \nApplicant\u2019s Israeli client companies (Tr. 251). Applicant explained the Israeli companies \ntrust him with their proprietary secrets because of their long-term relationships, and \nbecause he understands their technology and knows how best to put it to use in the \nUnited States (Tr. 318). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant has made impressive contributions to the security protection levels of \nU.S. airports and other public places through the technology and products his \ncompanies have sold to the U.S. government and defense industry.6 His products have \nsignificantly improved the protection, survivability, and effectiveness of U.S. tactical \nforces in combat. Many of these technical advances and products are also being made \navailable to U.S. law enforcement personnel to assist in the fight against terrorism and \ndrugs.  \n \nApplicant incorporated several companies in Israel to assist him with M\u2019s \nbusiness in the United States. The principal company, \u201cK,\u201d was incorporated in 1996 \n(Tr. 154, 242). This company serves as a conduit for M to interact with its clients in \nIsrael. It deals directly with the Israeli companies, and it is a key element in supporting \nM\u2019s U.S. business (Tr. 349-350). Applicant owns 90% of K, and his Israeli local general \nmanager owns 10%. The company has between eight and 11 Israeli employees. \nApplicant communicates telephonically with K\u2019s manager at least twice a week and via \ne-mail around three to four times a week. He has personal contact with the manager \nevery time he travels to Israel, or when the manager travels to the United States, \napproximately once a year (Tr. 244). Applicant stated he does not sell U.S. products in \nIsrael through any of his companies. The only products his Israeli companies sell in \nIsrael, or to other countries, are those products produced by his companies in Israel (Tr. \n155). \n \n\u201cMD\u201d is a manufacturing company incorporated by Applicant under K in Israel (Tr. \n245). It developed and manufactures aerosol detecting sprays sold by K in Israel and \nother countries. The same products are manufactured for M to be sold in the United \nStates. K makes approximately $2-3 million in profits a year from the sale of these \nproducts. \u201cKPS\u201d is another company under K. According to Applicant, KPS took \ntechnology from another Israeli company, modified it to make it more effective, and \nsupplied the products to M for sale in the United States. Applicant sits on the board of \ndirectors for both MD and KPS (Tr. 249). \n \nThrough the years, Applicant has maintained close contact with the Israeli \nEmbassy in Washington, D.C. He attends periodic meetings at the Embassy and \nreceives e-mails from the Embassy\u2019s Defense Cooperation Office (Answer to the SOR, \nGE 26). His last attendance to an Embassy defense industry briefing was in August \n2007 (GE 3). \n \nApplicant has extensive contacts and a personal relationship with General X, a \nretired chief of the Israeli Aman Military Intelligence (Tr. 280-289, Answer, GEs 23 & \n28).7 He met General X approximately in 2000, when the General was the head of one \nof Israel\u2019s intelligence services. He was introduced to the General by his brother. \n \n6  The file contains a detailed description of Applicant\u2019s impressive contributions. See Tr. 134-\n154, 168-188; AEs C, H, I. \n \n7  The Aman Military Intelligence is one of the three bodies that form the Israeli intelligence \nservices (GE 36). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant believes his brother and the General became friends when they served \ntogether in the Israeli forces. He noted that most of his contacts with General X have \nbeen since the General retired from the Israeli Army Military Intelligence. Applicant \nmeets with General X for dinner once or twice a year. He met with General X four times \nin 2007. They e-mail each other and talk on the telephone about once or twice a month. \nAccording to Applicant, General X is actively involved in the defense industries of both \nthe United States and Israel (Tr. 287-288). General X sits on the boards of companies \nwith whom Applicant\u2019s company conducts or would like to conduct business (Answer). \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied ever discussing or conducting business with General X \n(Tr. 280-289). \n \nIn 2006, a federal agency sponsored Applicant\u2019s company to receive a facility \nsecurity clearance at the secret level (Tr. 297, 302, AE A). Because he is the sole owner \nand key management person for M, he is required to have the same level of access. \nConsequently, he submitted security clearance applications in May 2006 and May 2007 \n(GEs 1 and 2). \n \nApplicant considers himself to be a dual citizen of both the United States and \nIsrael (GEs 1 and 2). He explained, however, that in his heart and mind he knows he is \nonly a U.S. citizen. Since 1988, he has made the United States his home. His four \nchildren were born and are being educated in the United States. He intends to retire in \nthe United States (Tr. 228). He has stated his willingness to renounce his Israeli \ncitizenship, if necessary (Answer to the SOR). \n \nAs an Israeli citizen, Applicant possessed an Israeli passport most of his life. \nApplicant used his Israeli passport to travel in and out of Israel from 1982 to April 2008. \nHe averages five or six trips to Israel a year (Tr. 237). He traveled to Israel seven times \nin 2004; five times in 2005; eight times in 2006; seven times in 2007; and twice in 2008 \n(Tr. 236). He last renewed his Israeli passport in May 2006, and it had an expiration \ndate of May 2016. Applicant used his Israeli passport in preference to his U.S. passport \nbecause Israeli law required him to have an Israeli passport to enter and leave Israel.  \n \nApplicant was made aware of the security concerns raised by his possession of a \nvalid Israeli passport when he received his March 2008 SOR. He surrendered his Israeli \npassport to the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., in April 2008 (Tr. 229, AE A). \nApplicant was informed by the Israeli Embassy that for him to enter Israel using his U.S. \npassport, he is required to inform, ahead of time, the Israel border police, through the \nIsraeli consulate, of his intentions to travel to Israel (Tr. 231, 233). Applicant intends to \ncontinue his frequent travels to Israel to be able to run his businesses in the United \nStates and Israel, and to visit his family. He volunteered to restrict his travels as \nnecessary or to report to the proper U.S. authorities all trips to Israel to minimize any \npossible risks arising from his numerous trips to Israel (Tr. 191, 378). He also destroyed \nhis Israeli identification card by cutting it in half. He then returned it to the Israeli \nEmbassy (Tr. 157). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant\u2019s father was a car salesman (Tr. 117). In 1979, he gave Applicant a \nsmall apartment in Israel (Tr. 157, 237). He sold the apartment in 1990, and purchased \nanother apartment, which he now uses as a rental property. He estimated the value of \nthis apartment at around $400,000 (GE 18). He is in the process of selling this \napartment and expects to conclude its sale around March 2009 (Tr. 240). In June 2007, \nApplicant purchased a second apartment for his personal use when he travels to Israel. \nHe estimated the value of this apartment at $850,000 (Tr. 238, GE 18). He volunteered \nto sell both apartments in order to alleviate security concerns (Tr. 240). Applicant also \nhad an Israeli bank account that he used to conduct business in Israel. The bank \naccount had a balance of about $100,000. After receipt of the SOR, Applicant closed \nthe bank account to alleviate security concerns (Tr. 241). He no longer has any cash or \ncash equivalent in Israel (Tr. 159). \n \nApplicant owns two homes in the United States, his primary residence and a \nvacation/retirement home (Answer to SOR). He believes his U.S. cash net worth to be \nbetween $60 to $70 million (Tr. 159, Answer). \n \nHis mother is 76 years old. She is a retired elementary school teacher and \nprincipal. He calls his mother every Friday night to wish her blessing before the Sabbath \n(Tr. 254). Whenever he is in Israel, they always have dinner together on Friday nights. \nApplicant has two siblings. His brother is a well known physician in Israel. They \ncommunicate telephonically at least once every two weeks (Tr. 255). His brother\u2019s wife \nis a retired economic advisor to a non-profit organization (Tr. 117). Applicant\u2019s sister is a \nschool teacher. They communicate telephonically once every two months (Tr. 257). His \nbrother-in-law works in a pharmacy.  \n \nApplicant has four aunts and uncles in Israel. He has almost no contact with \nthem (Tr. 259-260). Applicant\u2019s mother, siblings, in-laws, and extended relatives are \nresidents and citizens of Israel (except his mother-in-law). He stated that none of his \nrelatives have been or are connected with the Israeli government, intelligence, or \nsecurity services, except for having complied with their compulsory military service \nobligations (Answer to SOR, Tr. 116-118). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a resident of Israel; however, she is not an Israeli \ncitizen. He communicates with his mother-in-law approximately once a month (Tr. 258). \nHis wife has three siblings all of whom are residents and citizens of Israel (Tr. 259). He \ncommunicates with them approximately once every two months.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s references included: (1) a U.S. retired lieutenant general,8 (2) a \nformer Director of two U.S. law enforcement organizations,9 (3) an attorney who has \n \n8  Currently, senior vice president for strategic planning for M, one of Applicant\u2019s companies (Tr. \n220). \n \n9  Employed by M as a consultant for the last six years. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbeen Applicant\u2019s friend and neighbor for 20 years, and (4) a friend and employee10 who \nhas known Applicant for 20 years.  \n \nApplicant was described as honest, completely trustworthy, and as an \nupstanding person with high integrity. His references and friends assess him as \nconscientious, and responsible. He is a highly successful and astute business man, \ndedicated father and husband, and extremely loyal U.S. citizen. One of his references \nremembered Applicant stating at his naturalization ceremony that his naturalization as a \nU.S. citizen was one of the most important things he had done in his life (Tr. 348). The \nformer Director of the federal law enforcement agency considers Applicant to be an \nAmerican patriot who has contributed more to the United States and its safety than he \nhad in his 40 years of service (Tr. 340). \n \nApplicant\u2019s references consider him an ethical person with unique skills who has \nmade invaluable contributions to the safety of U.S. servicemen and the United States. \nHis references recommend him for a security clearance without reservations.  \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The government of Israel is a \nparliamentary democracy. The Israeli government generally respects the human rights \nof its citizens, but there are some issues with respect to treatment of Palestinian \ndetainees, conditions in some detention and interrogation facilities, and discrimination \nagainst Israel\u2019s Arab citizens. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed \na close friendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security \ninterests. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy and the United \nStates is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. Since 1976, Israel has been the largest \nrecipient of U.S. foreign aid. The two countries also have very close security relations.   \n \n \nU.S. - Israeli bilateral relations are multidimensional and complex. Israel has \ngiven a high priority to gaining wide acceptance as a sovereign state and to ending \nhostilities with Arab forces. Israel and the United States participate in joint military \nplanning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on military research and \nweapons development. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well being has been a \ncornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, and the two \ncountries are bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as mutual interests. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, there are several issues of concern regarding U.S. relations \nwith Israel. These include Israel\u2019s military sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection \nof U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related cases. There are several cases of \nU.S. citizens convicted for selling, or attempting to sell, classified documents to Israeli \nEmbassy officials, as well as cases of Israeli nationals indicted for espionage.   \n \n \nIsrael is one of the most active collectors of proprietary information. Israeli \nmilitary officers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in the United \n                                                     \n10  Currently, senior vice president and COO for M. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                     \nStates. There have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, \nof U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel. \n \n \nThe theft of sensitive and proprietary information threatens U.S. national security \nin both military and economic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities \nof foreign governments and foreign companies. Industrial espionage is intelligence-\ngathering \u201cconducted by a foreign government or by a foreign company with direct \nassistance of a foreign government against a private U.S. company for the purpose of \nobtaining commercial secrets.\u201d Industrial espionage is not limited to targeting \ncommercial secrets of a merely civilian nature, but rather can include the targeting of \ncommercial secrets that have military applications, sensitive technology that can be \nused to harm the United States and its allies, and classified information.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.11 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d12 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \n11  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n12  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                     \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign own or foreign operated business, which could \nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.13 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with his mother, siblings, and his in-laws; all of \nwhom are citizens and residents of Israel (except for his mother-in-law). The closeness \nof the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent telephone, e-mail, and personal \ncontacts with them during his frequent trips to Israel.  \n \nApplicant also has long-time friends, business partners/associates in Israel, \nsome of whom are or were members of the ISA and of the Israeli intelligence service. \nAdditionally, he owns two apartments in Israel worth approximately $1.2 million, and \nseveral profitable companies with yearly revenue around $2 to $3 million. Applicant\u2019s \nmulti-million dollar business in the United States depends largely on his personal \ncontacts with the Israeli government, companies, friends and business associates. \nThese close relationships and contacts create a potential conflict on interest between \nhis obligation to protect U.S. sensitive information and his desire to help the government \nof Israel, a person, or a company by providing that information.  \n \nThese contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Israeli agents, a person, or a company may \nexploit the opportunity to obtain information about the United States. Israel is one of the \nmost active collectors of sensitive and proprietary information from the United States. \nIsraeli military officers have been implicated in the collection in the United States of \nclassified and proprietary technology. There have been cases involving the illegal \nexport, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel. His \nconnection to his in-laws and long-time Israeli friends, business partners and associates \nalso creates a potential conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently \nclose to raise a security concern about his desire to help them by providing sensitive or \nclassified information.  \n \n \n13  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U. \nS.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply and do not mitigate the security concerns \nraised.  \n \nAppellant did not establish it is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of his Israeli family, friends, and business associates and \nthe interests of the U.S. His frequent contacts and close relationships with his Israeli \nfamily members, long-time friends, and business associates could potentially force him \nto choose between the United States and Israel.  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nHis connections and relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security \nconcern about his desire to help his family, friends, and associates by providing \nsensitive information. Applicant\u2019s frequent travel to Israel also creates a higher risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the Israeli government, \nfriends, and business associates working for the government of Israel or its defense \ncontractors.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s multi-million dollar business in the United States depends largely on \nhis close personal relationships with the Israeli government and defense companies \u2013 \nhis clients in Israel. Considering Israel\u2019s aggressive posture in the collection of sensitive \nand proprietary information in the United States, these relationships, and Applicant\u2019s \nbusiness\u2019 dependence on those business relationships, create a higher risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the Israeli government, his friends, \nand business associates. AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply. \n \nThe nature of Israel\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. I considered that \nthe Israeli government is a parliamentary democracy with a close friendship and \ncooperative relationship with the United States based on common democratic values, \nreligious affinities, and security interests. Israel generally respects the human rights of \nits citizens. The United States and Israel enjoy good relations and the United States is \nIsrael's largest trading partner. Also, Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. \n \nNotwithstanding, Israel\u2019s aggressive collection of sensitive and proprietary \ninformation raises the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nimmediate family members, friends, and business associates in Israel do not pose a \nsecurity risk and that he will not be placed into a position to be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and his family members.  \n \nApplicant was born and grew up in Israel. He served in the Israeli Army; worked \nfor the Israeli Port Authority (where he received training by the ISA); worked as an \nIsraeli Embassy security guard and received additional training by the ISA; worked at \nthe Israeli Embassy as a research and development assistant defense attach\u00e9 and \npossessed an Israeli security clearance; and he worked for an Israeli company selling \nIsraeli defense related products to the United States. Applicant\u2019s background allowed \nhim to establish his close relationships and business associations with the Israeli \ngovernment, its companies, and the Israeli defense industry. Applicant has continued \nhis contacts and relationship with long-time ISA friends and with a retired general, chief \nof the Israeli Aman intelligence service. He also maintains a close association with the \nIsraeli Embassy in the United States. Considering Applicant\u2019s background, his friends \nand associates, and his business, the Israeli government may be monitoring Applicant\u2019s \nwork, his trips to Israel, and his communications with family and friends.  \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States and should be given credit for his \nconnections to the United States. He has lived in the United States for approximately 26 \nyears. He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for around 10 years. His children have \ninculcated U.S. values. Applicant and his wife have established themselves as \nsuccessful American citizens. He has worked hard and his company is highly \nsuccessful. However, when his favorable information is balanced against his contact \nwith foreign persons, which is substantial, there remains a potential conflict of interest. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) does not mitigate the security concerns raised because Applicant has \nsignificant contacts with family members, friends, and professional associates who are \nresidents and citizens of Israel. Such contacts create a risk of foreign exploitation \nbecause of the Israeli government\u2019s active collection of sensitive U.S. economic, \nindustrial, and proprietary information. This is documented by cases involving the illegal \nexport, or attempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel.  \n \nAvailable information sustains a conclusion that there is a risk that the Israeli \ngovernment, or Applicant\u2019s contacts in Israel may attempt to exploit Applicant directly, or \nby exploiting Applicant\u2019s family and friends in Israel. Applicant\u2019s situation creates a \npotential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligations to protect sensitive \ninformation and his desire/obligation to help himself, or his family and friends were they \nunder exploitation by a foreign interest. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) Applicant may be disqualified for the \u201cexercise of any right, \nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession \nof a current foreign passport; and (3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social \nwelfare, or other such benefits.\u201d Applicant renewed and used his Israeli passport and \nidentification card after becoming a U.S. citizen and he owns property in Israel.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10(c) Applicant may be disqualified for \u201cperforming or attempting to \nperform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in conflict with the national security interest.\u201d \nApplicant has deep, long-standing symbiotic business relationships with the government \nof Israeli and approximately 10 Israeli clients companies. He has been doing business \nwith some of these companies for close to 20 years. He has been a trusted \nrepresentative and advisor for these Israeli companies. In some cases, he manages the \nday-to-day operation of subsidiary companies, or particular programs, of his Israeli \n\n \n15 \n \n \nclients in the United States. Applicant\u2019s multi-million dollar business in the United States \ndepends largely on his personal contacts with the Israeli government, companies, \nfriends and business associates. Additionally, he has frequent contact and \ncommunication with the Israeli Embassy in the United States, and serves as a liaison \nbetween the Embassy, Israeli companies, and the U.S. government and defense \nindustry. AG \u00b6 10(c) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nUp to April 2008, Applicant enjoyed all the privileges and rights of Israeli citizens. \nApplicant\u2019s possession and use of an Israeli passport in preference of his U.S. passport, \nas well as his use of the Israeli identification card, banking system, and ownership and \nproperty in Israel show he is exercising his Israeli citizenship and preference for Israel.  \n \n \nIn 1982, at age 25, he travelled to the United States to work at the Israeli \nEmbassy and attend college. He applied for residence in 1988 and became a U.S. \nnaturalized citizen in 1998. He and his immediate family have made the United States \ntheir home. His children are being raised as Americans, and he intends to retire in the \nUnited States. A substantial portion of Applicant\u2019s financial and economic ties are in the \nUnited States. However, because his business in the United States depends largely on \nhis close contacts with the Israeli government, companies, his business in Israel, as well \nas his contacts with Israeli citizens, he also has significant financial, economic, and \nproprietary interests in Israel. \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \n \nApplicant has made impressive contributions to the protection and security of the \nUnited States. His contributions have significantly improved the protection, survivability, \nand effectiveness of U.S. tactical forces in combat, and assist U.S. law enforcement \npersonnel in the fight against terrorism and drugs. Applicant surrendered his Israeli \npassport, destroyed his identification card, expressed his willingness to renounce his \nIsraeli citizenship, if necessary, and volunteered to disclose and allow monitoring of his \ntrips to Israel. \n \n \nThese facts warrant partial application of foreign preference mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b): \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\u201d \nand 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  \n \n \nNotwithstanding the applicability of these mitigating conditions, they do not fully \nmitigate the foreign preference security concerns. Applicant\u2019s security concerns were \nraised by his exercise of his Israeli citizenship after he became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. He surrendered his Israeli passport and identification card and that mitigated the \npassport specific issues. However, Applicant continues to exercise his Israeli citizenship \nthrough his business and properties in Israel. Considering the record as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s continued exercise of his Israeli citizenship fails to mitigate the foreign \npreference security concerns. \n \nGuideline L, Outside Activities \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 36, the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[i]nvolvement in certain types \nof outside employment or activities is of security concern if it poses a conflict of interest \nwith an individual's security responsibilities and could create an increased risk of \nunauthorized disclosure of classified information.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 37 sets out two conditions that may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) any employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with:  \n \n \n(1) the government of a foreign country;  \n \n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity;  \n \n(3) a representative of any foreign interest; \n(4) any foreign, domestic, or international organization or person \nengaged in analysis, discussion, or publication of material on \nintelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or protected technology; and  \n \n(b) failure to report or fully disclose an outside activity when this is \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant has deep, long-standing symbiotic business relationships with the \ngovernment of Israeli and approximately 10 Israeli clients or client\u2019s companies. He has \nbeen doing business with some of these companies for close to 20 years. He has been \n\n \n17 \n \n \na trusted representative and advisor for these Israeli companies. In some cases, he \nmanages the day-to-day operation of subsidiary companies, or particular programs, of \nhis Israeli clients in the United States. Applicant\u2019s multi-million dollar business in the \nUnited States depends largely on his personal contacts with the Israeli government, \ncompanies, friends and business associates. Additionally, he has frequent contact and \ncommunication with the Israeli Embassy in the United States, and serves as a liaison \nbetween the Embassy, Israeli companies, and the U.S. government and defense \nindustry. \n \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I find Applicant provides services to Israel-\nrelated entities and their representatives, companies, and to Israeli defense contractors. \nAG \u00b6 37(a)(2), and (3) apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 38 outlines conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nincluding: \n \n \n(a) evaluation of the outside employment or activity by the appropriate \nsecurity or counterintelligence office indicates that it does not pose a \nconflict with an individual's security responsibilities or with the national \nsecurity interests of the United States; and  \n  \n(b) the individual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity \nupon being notified that it was in conflict with his or her security \nresponsibilities. \n \nApplicant\u2019s favorable information fails to raise the applicability of these mitigating \nconditions. There is no evaluation by a security or counterintelligence office indicating \nthat Applicant\u2019s activities do not pose a conflict with his anticipated security \nresponsibilities or with the national interests of the United States. There is no evidence \nApplicant discontinued his activities of concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n18 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s favorable information is summarized as follows. \nApplicant and his family are loyal, proud Americans; they have woven themselves into \nthe fabric or America through their long-term participation in the community and their \njobs. Applicant and his wife have lived in the United States for 26 years and have been \nU.S. naturalized citizens for 10 years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore \nallegiance to the United States. Their children are native-born U.S. citizens, and have \nbeen raised and educated in the United States as Americans. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he and his wife intend to retire in the United States.  \n \nApplicant has made impressive contributions to the protection and security of the \nUnited States. His contributions have significantly improved the protection, survivability, \nand effectiveness of U.S. tactical forces in combat, and assisted U.S. law enforcement \npersonnel in the fight against terrorism and drugs. Applicant surrendered his Israeli \npassport, destroyed his identification card, expressed his willingness to renounce his \nIsraeli citizenship (if necessary), and volunteered to disclose and allow monitoring of his \ntrips to Israel. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause \npotential harm to the United States, or that he lacks honesty and integrity. He has the \nrespect and trust of his impressive references who recommended him for a security \nclearance without reservations. \n \n \nOn the other hand, numerous circumstances weigh against Applicant in the \nwhole person analysis: Israel\u2019s aggressive pursuit of sensitive or protected U.S. \ninformation; Applicant was born and educated in Israel, and emigrated at age 25; almost \nall of his relatives and in-laws (except his mother-in-law, wife and children) are residents \nand citizens of Israel. He served in the Israeli Army, worked for the Israeli government \nuntil 1988, and received training by the ISA in several of his jobs. He held the position of \nresearch and development assistant defense attach\u00e9 at the Israeli Embassy, and \npossessed an Israeli security clearance.  \n \nApplicant current business is directly derived from the jobs he held at the Israeli \nEmbassy. He has maintained contact with Israeli friends who are or were members of \nthe ISA, as well as with a retired general who was the head of one of Israel\u2019s \nintelligence sections. Applicant\u2019s lucrative U.S. business is directly tied to his close \ncontacts with the Israeli government and defense industry. He represents both \ncompanies owned by the government of Israel and Israeli defense contractors in their \nbusiness with the U.S. government and defense industry. Applicant\u2019s multi-million dollar \nbusiness in the United States depends largely on his personal contacts with the Israeli \ngovernment, companies, friends and business associates. \n \nIn sum, he had significant connections to Israel before he immigrated to the \nUnited States \u2013 connections that he continues to maintain. Applicant has frequent and \n\n \n19 \n \n \nnon-casual contact with his family members, friends, and business associates living in \nIsrael. These contacts create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause there is always the possibility that Israeli agents or defense contractors may \nattempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members, friends or business associates living in \nIsrael, as well as his business interests to obtain technological information. His financial \nand economic interests could be used to reward or pressure him to obtain information \nabout the United States.  \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign preference, foreign influence, and outside \nactivities.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n1.f, and 1.g: \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.e and 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline L:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n20 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: David P. Price, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his handling protected \ninformation and personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \n \nOn October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 25, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge The case was assigned to me on January 17, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 14, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nMay 22, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nscheduled on April 10, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called five \nwitnesses, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A-1 through A-20 and B-1 through B-29, which \nwere received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 22, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nThe SOR references paragraphs of the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM) (5220.22-M), dated January 1995, and also the NISPOM \ndated February 28, 2006. Department Counsel orally requested that I take \nadministrative notice of the referenced sections of both versions of the NISPOM. \nDepartment Counsel did not offer a copy of the requested provisions. The Federal \nRules of Evidence serve as a guide at DOHA hearings.1 The Appeal Board has noted \nthat administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader than judicial \nnotice under the Federal Rules of Evidence and is appropriate for DOHA hearings.2 \nRule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence addresses judicial notice: \n \n(d) When mandatory. A court shall take judicial notice if requested by a \nparty and supplied with the necessary information.  \n \n(e) Opportunity to be heard. A party is entitled upon timely request to an \nopportunity to be heard as to the propriety of taking judicial notice and the \ntenor of the matter noticed. In the absence of prior notification, the request \nmay be made after judicial notice has been taken. \n \nI withheld ruling on the request and directed Department Counsel to submit a copy of \nthe requested sections to myself and Applicant\u2019s counsel by April 25, 2008, with \nApplicant\u2019s counsel to file any objections by May 2, 2008. Department Counsel did not \nsubmit any matter by the assigned date. Department Counsel verified after the assigned \ndate was past that he did not submit the documentation. He did not request additional \ntime to submit any matter. Based upon the Government\u2019s failure to provide the \nnecessary information and the inability of Applicant to be heard on the matter, the \nrequest for administrative notice is denied. \n \nGE 6 (Master System Security Plan) \n \n \nGE 6 is the Master System Security Plan at Applicant\u2019s company. It is dated \nSeptember 2001 and revised March 2005. The conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \noccurred before the revision of the Plan. The Plan contains a description of the changes \nto the plan, which included \u201c[i]dentified security personnel\u201d and \u201c[e]laborated on the \n                                                          \n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19. \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007). \n \n\n \n3 \n \nroles of personnel.\u201d I held the record open until April 25, 2008, to allow the Government \nto submit a copy of the original Plan that was in effect during the first two SOR \nallegations. Applicant\u2019s counsel had until May 2, 2008, to file any objections and rebuttal \nmaterial. No additional evidence was submitted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old senior engineering specialist for a defense contractor. \nHe attended a few years of college and has a diploma from a technical school awarded \nin 1985. He started working for a defense contactor in 1985, and has held a security \nclearance since then. He has worked for his same management team since 1985, but \nthe companies have changed hands and went through name changes. He is married \nand has two children, ages 16 and 10.3  \n \n \nIn about March 2004, an employee at Applicant\u2019s company, in an unclassified \narea, scanned a large amount of documents into an electronic file. He did not believe \nthe documents contained any classified information. He e-mailed the file in an \nattachment to Applicant. Applicant forwarded the e-mail to several people without \nreading the attachment. He then started reading the attachment and realized it \ncontained information that could be classified. He immediately called his supervisor and \nthe company\u2019s security officer and reported it. He called all the recipients and told them \nnot to open the attachment. He was able to recall the e-mail without the information \nbeing compromised.4 Applicant was issued a written Security Violation Notice by \nInterdepartmental Correspondence on March 5, 2004. It stated: \n \nThough unintentional, your actions are in direct violation of established \nsecurity procedures to properly protect classified information. As a result \nthis Security Violation Notice is being issued to you. You are reminded \nthat the handling and protection of classified information requires extreme \ncaution and attention to individual responsibility in order to preclude \ncompromise or loss of classified information, customer criticism, and \npossible impact on our company\u2019s clearance by the Government. \nSubsequent violations may result in further disciplinary actions to include \ntermination.5 \n \n \nAccording to the Master System Security Plan at Applicant\u2019s company, the \nInformation System Security Manager (ISSM) \u201chas the oversight responsibility for the \ndevelopment, implementation, and evaluation of the facility\u2019s IS Security Program.\u201d The \nISSM appoints and delegates certain responsibilities to an Information System Security \nOfficer (ISSO).6 The company had a classified test station which consisted of a series of \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 88, 148-149, 200-201; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. at 47-51, 149-155; Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR; GE 3; AE A-1. \n \n5 GE 3. \n \n6 GE 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified computers in a secured area. Everyone who worked in the area had a \nclearance. It was the responsibility of the ISSM to set up the initial user accounts and \naccess privileges. The optimum way of accomplishing this for the company\u2019s project \nwould be to create a common user \u201cdesktop\u201d with all the access privileges and \npermissions set up. Each user would then be given their own copy of this desktop with \ntheir own unique login. For technical reasons, they were unable to do this and a \ncommon desktop was unattainable. Instead each user\u2019s desktop was set up uniquely, \noften with different privileges. Technicians received a limited set of privileges to run \ncertain software and access data files. Test engineers had somewhat more privileges \nsuch as accessing the test software. The ISSO had limited administrator privileges to \ncreate the user accounts and review the computer security logs. The ISSM had full \nadministrator rights to install/remove software and all the lesser privileges of the others.7  \n \n \nApplicant was orally named an ISSO some time in or before September 2004. \nThe standard briefing was an overview provided by the ISSM on an as-needed basis to \nexplain the basic rules. Applicant\u2019s briefing on his duties by the ISSM took about five \nminutes. Additional training was minimal or nonexistent.8 The test engineer who \ndesigned the test station in question described the ISSO: \n \nA person is assigned to be the Security Custodian for the station. He is \nresponsible for creating and disabling the user accounts as necessary, \nand to perform periodic audits of the security logs. This person is referred \nto as the ISSO (Information System Security Officer). He is typically not a \ncomputer security expert and receives only the most rudimentary training \nto perform his duties. I should note that the ISSO receives no additional \ncompensation or privileges for doing this duty. In reality the most likely \noutcome of being an ISSO is that at some point you will receive a security \nviolation, often for something that occurs on a station over which you had \nlittle or no control. Such is the case with [Applicant].9 \n \n \nA security review on September 14, 2004, revealed potential security violations. \nApplicant was formally designated the ISSO in writing with his delegated duties \nenumerated on September 23, 2004. Part of his listed duties included performing IS \nweekly audit reviews. He signed his Authorization and Briefing Form on the same day.10 \n \n \nApplicant was issued a Security Violation Notice (Written Warning) by \nInterdepartmental Correspondence on September 24, 2004. It stated: \n \nOn September 14, 2004 it was found that an unapproved computer had \nbeen connected to a system for at least three weeks in which you were \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 53-90; AE A-5. \n \n8 Tr. at 86, 167-168; AE A-5. \n \n9 AE A-5. \n \n10 Tr. at 167, 173; GE 4, 7, 8. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nthe Information System Security Officer. A check of system logs indicate \nthat the required weekly audit reviews had not occurred since the system \nwas established. Furthermore, you had admitted to allowing system \naccess beyond what had been established for user levels.  \n \nYour failure to perform required ISSO duties are in direct violation of \nestablished security procedures to properly protect classified information.  \nAs a result this Security Violation Notice is being issued to you. \nFurthermore, this is your second security violation (unrelated) within the \npast twelve months. This notice serves as a written warning reminding  \nyou that the handling and protection of classified information requires  \nextreme caution and attention to individual responsibility in order to \npreclude compromise or loss of classified information, customer criticism, \nand possible impact on our company\u2019s clearance by the Government. A \nsimilar subsequent violation will result in an adverse information report \nbeing submitted to the Government and may result in further disciplinary \nactions to include termination.11 \n \n \nThe security violation referencing the unapproved computer resulted from one of \nthe test engineers who had an unapproved computer that was linked to the classified \nsystem. Applicant had also not completed the required weekly audit reviews. The test \nengineer who designed the test station at issue wrote a statement and testified on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. He has also served as an ISSO. He stated that \u201cthe security logs are, \nat best, very cryptic and it is only recently (a few months ago) that our local DSS \nrepresentative has even explained what kind of log entries to look for as signs of \nsecurity problems.\u201d Additionally, some of the computers were running programs \nconstantly  for testing for as long as a few weeks. Automated testing took between 14 to \n18 hours to run. If the user logged off the system while it was running, the system would \nshut down and have to be restarted and rebooted, which would require the program to \nstart from the beginning. An audit would require the user to log off the system. The final \naspect of the security violation is that Applicant permitted the practice of people working \nwhile logged onto the system with other people\u2019s log-in, including Applicant\u2019s. This was \na common practice and was necessary to run the tests. Passwords were not shared; it \nwas done with everyone\u2019s knowledge; and all the workers had clearances. There is \nnothing specifically in the company\u2019s Master System Security Plan that prohibits this \npractice and it was eventually approved.12 \n \n \nThe project engineer testified and admitted that Applicant should have been \nremoved as ISSO after the second Security Violation Notice for his own protection. \nWhat was stressed after the second Security Violation Notice was that Applicant review \nthe computer security logs and complete the weekly audit reviews. There is no evidence \nthat this ever became a concern again. Running programs while logged onto the system \nwith other people\u2019s log-in was not emphasized as a concern. The project engineer \n                                                          \n11 GE 3. \n \n12 Tr. at 65-67, 79-85, 119-120, 159-160, 167-169; AE A-5. \n \n\n \n6 \n \ntestified that he did not realize it was against the rules to do so until after Applicant\u2019s \nthird Security Violation Notice.13 The test engineer who designed the test station also \ntestified. I asked him: \n \n \nQ: \nThe rules regarding logging on and off that gave a lot of problems, \nwere they established by the company, by the NISPOM, by DSS, or a \ncombination, or do you know? \n \n \nA: \nHonestly I don\u2019t know exactly.14 \n \n \nApplicant was issued a Security Violation Notice (Final Written Warning) by \nInterdepartmental Correspondence on October 30, 2006, stating: \n \nOn October 26th, 2006, you had admitted that you were logged into your \nadministrator account on an unapproved classified computer for the \npurpose of conducting a classified test which is unauthorized for that \npurpose. Furthermore, the account had remained logged in for fourteen \ndays and you had subsequently used the open account to conduct \nadditional tests suggesting that you were aware others were using your \nadministrator account.  \n \nUsing your ISSO account to perform classified testing is in direct violation \nof established security procedures. . . A similar subsequent violation will \nresult in termination of your employment.15 \n \n \nThe guidelines as far as users operating the system while logged onto another\u2019s \naccount were unclear. The problem with Applicant permitting others to be logged onto \nthe system with his log-in is that they could potentially access security logs that only the \nISSO should have access to. Applicant did not become aware that he had additional \naccess as an ISSO until the hearing. At some point after Applicant received his third \nSecurity Violation Notice, the implementation of the guidelines changed to essentially \npermit the system to stay logged onto the same user until the program ran its course. \nISSOs were still prohibited from permitting others to access the system with their ISSO \naccount. Applicant was removed as an ISSO after the third violation. No classified \ninformation was compromised as a result of the alleged security violations.16 \n \n \nFive witnesses testified on applicant\u2019s behalf. Twenty letters and numerous \nperformance appraisals, evaluations, awards, and accolades were submitted in \nevidence. Applicant is a conscientious, dedicated, and highly-valued employee. He is \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 124-128, 133-134. \n \n14 Tr. at 88. \n \n15 GE 5. \n \n16 Tr. at 59-60, 118-120, 131-134, 177-179, 195. \n \n\n \n7 \n \ndescribed as hard working, ethical, honest, trustworthy, and reliable. He is \nrecommended to retain his security clearance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \n\n \n8 \n \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Handling Protected Information \nis set out in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate or negligent disclosure of classified or other protected \ninformation to unauthorized persons, including but not limited to personal \nor business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at seminars, \nmeetings, or conferences; \n \n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \nin any other unauthorized location; \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \n\u201cpalm\u201d or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and \n \n(h) negligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n \nApplicant forwarded an e-mail without reading the attachment. When he read the \nattachment shortly thereafter, he realized that it contained classified information and \ntook immediate remedial action, which included reporting it to his supervisor and \nsecurity officer. This action satisfies the requirements of AG \u00b6 34(c). However, AG \u00b6 33 \naddresses \u201c[d]eliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information.\u201d Applicant\u2019s action was not \ndeliberate. Negligence is commonly defined as the failure to use reasonable care under \nthe circumstances. It is the doing of something which a reasonably prudent person \nwould not do, or the failure to do something which a reasonably prudent person would \n\n \n9 \n \ndo under like circumstances. After considering all the evidence, I conclude that the \nforwarding of the e-mail did not constitute negligent conduct.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions as listed in the second and third Security Violation Notices are \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(g) and 34(h) for consideration.  \nConditions that could mitigate Handling Protected Information security concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 35. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \n \n \nApplicant was chosen to be an ISSO without any real training on his \nresponsibilities. He was not formally designated the ISSO in writing with his delegated \nduties enumerated until September 23, 2004, the day before he was issued the second \nSecurity Violation Notice, but after the actions that formed the basis of the Notice. He \nstill did not receive sufficient training to do his job. It was stressed that Applicant review \nthe computer security logs and complete the weekly audit reviews. This behavior was \nnot repeated. The practice of people running programs while logged onto other person\u2019s \naccounts continued. It is still unclear where the prohibition of this practice came from, as \nit is not in the company\u2019s Master System Security Plan, the witnesses could not identify \nwho or what prohibited the practice, and the practice was eventually approved. ISSOs \ncould not and are still prohibited from permitting others to log-in through their account as \nit allows access to security files that should be available only to the ISSO, ISSM, and \nthe security officer. Because of the lack of proper training, he was unaware that he \ncould access files as the ISSO that others could not. Applicant did not have a lax \nattitude toward security. He always approached his job with a view toward protecting \nclassified information. He simply was ill-prepared for his additional security duties. He \nno longer has those additional duties. He approaches the discharge of his security \nresponsibilities with a renewed vigor and a positive attitude. I find all three mitigating \nconditions to be applicable.  \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n10 \n \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct was also alleged under the Handling Protected \nInformation guideline, as addressed above. It constitutes credible adverse information in \nanother adjudicative issue area that may not be sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It is also personal conduct that \ncould create a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(e) have been raised for consideration. \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThe discussion under the guideline for Handling Protected Information is equally \nappropriate for this guideline. Additionally, Applicant has been open and honest about \nthe conduct which has reduced any potential vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress. The above mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Security violations are one of the \nstrongest possible reasons for denying or revoking access to classified information, as \nthey raise very serious questions about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Once it is established that an applicant has committed a security violation, \nhe or she has a very heavy burden of demonstrating that he or she should be entrusted \nwith classified information. Because security violations strike at the very heart of the \nindustrial security program, an Administrative Judge must give any claims of reform and \nrehabilitation strict scrutiny. In many security clearance cases, applicants are denied a \nclearance for having an indicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation \n(e.g., alcohol abuse, delinquent debts or drug use). Security violation cases reveal more \nthan simply an indicator of risk.17 The frequency and duration of the security violations \nare also aggravating factors.18 Applicant is a hard working, dedicated, honest man who \nwas in over his head as an ISSO. His problems were compounded by the almost \ncomplete lack of training. He focused on the big picture of safeguarding the classified \ninformation, but the devil is in the details, and he was not armed to handle the details. \nThere is no real potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress and the \n                                                          \n17 ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006). \n \n18 ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 5 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998). \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence of the same behavior is very low. Applicant has \nmet his heavy burden. I am convinced that there are no lingering concerns about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his handling \nprotected information and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

Clearance is denied.\nOn July 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the allegations, on August 19,\n2008, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 5, 2009. On\nMarch 16, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the case for April 9, 2009. It\nMay 29, 2009\n\n2\nwas held as scheduled. At the hearing, I received 10 government exhibits and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was received on April 15, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old man with three children, ages 19, 12, and eight. He is\ncurrently separated from his wife, the mother of the 12-year-old (Tr. 14). The other two\nchildren are from other relationships.\nApplicant has a high school education. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1988 to\n1991. His discharge was honorable. For the past 11 years, he has worked for a defense\ncontractor as an industrial applicator. His job duties include painting, lead inspection,\nand sandblasting of Navy vessels (Tr. 16). For the past four to five years, he has been a\nsupervisor.\nOn April 17, 1996, Applicant was charged with assault and battery after an\naltercation with his wife (Answer). The charge was later dismissed (Answer to SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a).\nOn or about April 7, 1998, Applicant\u2019s wife accused him of assaulting her, and\nlater making threats to her life over the phone (Answer to SOR subparagraph 1.b). At\nthe time, they were separated, and a protective order was in place. Subsequently,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery, using profane, threatening\nlanguage over a public airway, violating emergency protective orders, and threatening\nbodily harm (Answer). He was found guilty of misdemeanor domestic assault, and the\nremaining charges were nolle prossed. \nOn February 24, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with contempt of\ncourt (Answer to SOR subparagraph 1.c). There is no record evidence either identifying\nthe court order that Applicant allegedly violated, or detailing the outcome of the charge.\nOn March 18, 2000, Applicant was charged with malicious wounding and carrying\na concealed weapon after a nightclub brawl with several bouncers (Answer to SOR\nsubparagraph 1.d, at 2). The concealed weapon was a small knife attached to his key\nchain (Tr. 32). The charges were nolle prossed.\nIn 2000, Applicant\u2019s friend devised a scheme where he would print counterfeit\nchecks using his computer. The checks were written to various friends, including\nApplicant. Over a two to three month period, Applicant cashed approximately $18,000 of\ncounterfeit checks at a local credit union (Tr. 20). \nOn June 30, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with multiple counts of\nforging bank notes, and obtaining money by false pretenses (Answer at 2, SOR\nsubparagraph 1.f). He was found guilty of the latter charge, sentenced to three years,\nsuspended, and ordered to pay restitution.\n\nThe \u201cfailure to appear\u201d charge, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.g, is a duplicate of SOR subparagraph 1.e.\n1\n3\nOn October 6, 2000, Applicant was found guilty of driving on a suspended\nlicense and failure to appear (Answer at 2). For each charge, he was sentenced to 10\ndays in jail with five days suspended pending 12 months of good behavior, and payment\nof costs.1\nOn February 12, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony probation\nviolation for not paying restitution as ordered in 2000 (SOR subparagraph 1.h, Answer\nat 2; Tr. 21). He was found guilty and required to start serving his prison sentence. After\napproximately one month, he was released, and re-sentenced to three years,\nsuspended, pending his successful completion of five years probation and payment of\nrestitution.\nOn March 26, 2002, Applicant fell asleep at the wheel of his car while driving\nhome from work, and hit a telephone pole (Answer, SOR subparagraph 1.i; Tr. 33). He\nhad not been drinking alcohol before the accident. The police arrived and charged him\nwith reckless driving (Answer at 2). The outcome of this charge is unknown from the\nrecord.\nOn or about April 1, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with failure to\nappear on a misdemeanor charge (SOR subparagraph 1.j, Answer at 2). The court\nconcluded that Applicant was not notified properly of the charge. Consequently, the\ncharge was dismissed (Tr. 24).\nOn May 20, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with probation violation\nfor allegedly not making his restitution payments from the 2000 felony conviction (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.k). Applicant pleaded not guilty, and provided evidence that he had\nbeen making payments (Tr. 35). The charge was then dismissed.\nIn 2005, Applicant fell behind on his restitution payments. In approximately July\n2005, he was arrested and charged with violation of probation (SOR subparagraph 1.l).\nThis charge was dismissed after Applicant satisfied his back restitution payments. \nSince 2005, Applicant has satisfied all of the restitution payments. He is no\nlonger on probation.\nOn February 11, 2008, Applicant\u2019s estranged wife attacked him in the parking lot\nof his job (Tr. 38). An altercation ensued. Subsequently, both Applicant and his wife\npressed charges (SOR subparagraph 1.m). They then both agreed to drop the charges\n(Tr. 39).\nApplicant attributes the domestic incidents to his volatile ex-wife. He contends\nthat his physical contact during their altercations has been limited to pinning her down\nor restraining her after she attacked him. During some episodes when she got physical,\n\n4\nApplicant left the home. She has pressed charges against him after both types of\nsituations. Their divorce is pending.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, . . . it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 30).\nBetween 1996 and 2008, Applicant was arrested 12 times and charged with numerous\ncrimes. The most serious was a felony that resulted in a three year suspended sentence\nand five years of probation. AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrest occurred less that 18 months ago. Consequently,\nAG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\n\n5\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not\napply.\nThere is no record evidence either identifying the court order that Applicant\nallegedly violated, or detailing the outcome of the charge listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.c. Consequently, I have resolved this subparagraph in his favor.\nSOR subparagraph 1.j fails to identify the misdemeanor for which Applicant\nallegedly failed to appear in court. The record contains no additional clarifying evidence,\nand the charge was dismissed. SOR subparagraph 1.j is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant was arrested in 2004 and charged with violation of probation after the\nstate alleged he was not making restitution payments related to his 2000 conviction. He\nsuccessfully proved that he had been making the payments, and the court dismissed\nthe charge. SOR subparagraph 1.k is resolved in his favor.\nMany of Applicant\u2019s legal troubles stemmed from his tempestuous relationship\nwith his currently estranged wife who may have precipitated much of their conflict. Their\ndivorce is pending. AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing\nthe act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life,\u201d is partially\napplicable.\nApplicant has paid restitution and served probation for his most serious crime,\nthe 2000 felony. His restitution payments, however, were inconsistent, leading to an\narrests in 2002 and 2005 for probation violation. Also, as described above, Applicant\u2019s\nmost recent arrest occurred less than 18 months ago. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6\n32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining, or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement,\u201d applies, but has limited probative value.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n6\nMuch of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct stemmed from his troubled relationship with\nhis estranged wife. Because their divorce is being finalized, these domestic-related\noffenses are unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s most serious offense, the check cashing\nfraud, did not involve his wife, however. In that Applicant was 32-years-old when he\nparticipated in the fraudulent check cashing scheme, immaturity is not a mitigating\nfactor. In light of the nature, extent, and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct,\ntogether with its frequency and recency, I conclude the possibility of recurrence is\nunacceptably high. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\nClearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j - 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l - 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Between 2000 and 2004, Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts. Altogether, he incurred four delinquent debts that were covered in the SOR. Of these listed debts, one (creditor 1.a) resulted in an adverse judgment entered against him. Two of the debts (creditors 1.b and 1.c are relatively small in amount).

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge\nStatement of Case\nOn September 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 9, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 25, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on\nNovember 29, 2007.  A hearing was held on November 29, 2007, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\nJanuary 18, 2008\n\n2\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on December 10, 2007.       \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his creditor contacts and efforts to repay his creditors.\nThere being no objection from the Government, and good cause being demonstrated,\nApplicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record.  Applicant failed to\nsupplement the record.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent\ndebts: He is alleged (a) to have a judgment entered against him for $1,666.00 and (b) to\nhave three delinquent debts in excess of $42,000.00.  Under Guideline E, Applicant is\nalleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86), dated January 9,\n2007, by denying any debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively.\nFor his response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted the judgment entered against\nhim and the listed three delinquent debts without explanation.  He denied any deliberate\nfalsification of his SF-86.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a  50-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant is married with three children.  He has an Associates degree from a\nlocal community college and is assigned to missile testing by his defense employer.\nBetween 2000 and 2004, Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts.\nAltogether, he incurred four delinquent debts that were covered in the SOR.  Of these\nlisted debts, one (creditor 1.a) resulted in an adverse judgment entered against him.\nTwo of the debts (creditors 1.b and 1.c are relatively small in amount).  By far, his\nlargest debt is a deficiency balance following the creditor\u2019s (creditor 1.d) repossession of\nhis mobile home in 2004 (R.T., at 19-20). \nApplicant has little recall of the circumstances that prompted the apartment\ncomplex to seek and obtain a judgment against him in January 2001.  He assures his\nwife is committed to contacting the judgment creditor to pay off the judgment (R.T., at\n16-17).  He assures, too, that he intends to take care of both his medical (creditor 1.b)\nand furniture debts (R.T., at 17-19).  Afforded a post-hearing opportunity to document\nhis repayment efforts with both of these creditors, Applicant failed to do so.\n\n3\nMore difficult to reconcile is the deficiency balance associated with the\nrepossession of Applicant\u2019s mobile home in 2004.  Applicant purchased the home for\naround $66,000.00 in 2000, or thereabouts, 2 (R.T., at 28-30).  After making payments\non the home for several years, his wife hurt her back in 2003 and was out of work for\nalmost a year on disability (R.T., at 20-21).   Applicant tried to obtain refinancing of the\nhome with the mortgagee following his wife\u2019s injury, but without success (R.T., at 20-\n21).  In 2004, the mortgagee repossessed the home.  Following the creditor\u2019s\nrepossession of the home for defaulted payments, he was notified of the impending\npublic sale, and later the deficiency balance that remained following the sale of the\nhome for around $25,000.00 (R.T., at 30-31).  The mortgagee never responded to\nApplicant\u2019s letter requests to settle the deficiency and has continued to demand the full\ndeficiency (R.T., at 22, 31-32).    \nApplicant and his wife (W) now live in a temporary mobile home.  W has worked\nat a grocery store, but has had to quit working after suffering a heart attack.  Last year,\nApplicant was in an auto accident that caused him to miss several weeks of work (R.T.,\nat 24).  \nApplicant\u2019s income and expenses remain unchanged.  His monthly take home\npay of around $1,560.00 is barely enough to cover his expenses.  He has a savings\nplan that is funded by payroll deductions (R.T., at 25-26).  Applicant filed for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in the 80s and received his discharge.  Since emerging from Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, he has encountered difficulty keeping up with his debts with the amount of\nincome available to him.  \nAsked to complete an SF-86 in January 2007, Applicant omitted his mobile home\ndebt.  When asked about his debts in a June 2007 OPM  interview, he disclosed his\ndebts, including the deficiency owed on his mobile home without any prompting from the\nagent (R.T., at 34-35). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n\n4\nFinancial Considerations\n\u201cThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, para. 18).  \nPersonal Conduct\n    \u201cThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure\nto cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, para. 15).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\n\n5\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts between 2000 and 2004\nafter his wife hurt her back and had to quit working.  Three of the debts are relatively\nsmall and include an unsatisfied judgment.  A fourth debt covers a deficiency balance\non a mobile home repossession and is significant (around $42,000.00).  To date, he\nhas been unable to document any repayment efforts regarding any of the listed debts\nin the SOR.  Security concerns are also raised over Applicant\u2019s omissions of his\ndelinquent debts in the SF-86 he executed in June 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nRegulation where the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation\nof delinquent debts and his failure to document his addressing of any of them, even\nwith additional time afforded after the hearing, warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations: DC 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and DC 19\u00a9) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).\nApplicant attributes his debt delinquencies to his wife\u2019s disability and more\nrecent medical issues, and to his own inability to earn enough money to pay off his\nsmaller debts and continue to carry the payments on his mobile home.  To a  limited\nextent in this case, Applicant\u2019s accrued debts do merit extenuation credit.   His debts all\nbear some relationship to his wife\u2019s health setbacks associated with her work-related\naccident in 2003, and more recent heart attack.  Under these recounted circumstances,\nMC 20 (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d) of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the\nguidelines for financial considerations has some application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nMitigation is more difficult to establish without any documented repayment\nefforts with his creditors.  The new Adjudicative Guidelines simply do not permit\nmitigation credit for unresolved debts  without documented proof that the applicant has\nmade earnest efforts to resolve his debts with the resources and counseling sources\navailable to him.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of good judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  Financial stability in a person cleared to access classified information\nis required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance. \n\n6\nBased on both the guidelines and a whole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity risk, given the present state of his finances, Applicant still leaves too many\nquestions unanswered regarding his repayment efforts to mitigate raised security\nconcerns.  Whether his lack of documented efforts to resolve the remainder of his\ncreditors is the result of information or resource problems is not clear, but the\nnecessary documentation and/or probative showing of a concrete repayment efforts\nhas not been demonstrated.   Applicant\u2019s current finances remain too unsettled to\nenable safe predictions that he will be able to regain sufficient control of them to\nabsolve him of continuing security risks. \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations and lack of probative efforts to repay them, Applicant fails to\nmitigate security concerns related to his longstanding debt delinquencies.  Unfavorable\nconclusions are drawn with respect to the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a\nthrough 1.e. \nPersonal conduct issues with SF-86 omissions\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list his debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively.   So\nmuch trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that the margins\nfor excusing candor lapses are necessarily narrow.\nApplicant\u2019s omissions require initial application of a disqualifying condition (DC)\nfor personal conduct of the Guidelines: 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d).  \nWhile it is less than clear why Applicant answered in the negative to having\ndelinquent debts when he responded to question 28 of his January 2007 SF-86, he is\ncredited with supplying prompt, good faith answers when subsequently interviewed by\nan OPM agent.  MC 17(a) of the Guidelines (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d) is applicable. \nBased on his prompt, good-faith disclosure of his debt delinquencies, Applicant is able\nto successfully mitigate security concerns associated with his omissions. \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2.2 factors), favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to sub-paragraph  2.a of Guideline E.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, and the factors listed above, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras 1.a through 1.e\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

He is employed by a defense contractor as a Material Production Clerk, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants. The Applicant admitted most of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.

On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and \nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance \nshould be denied or revoked. \n \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 5, 2007, and \nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to \nthe undersigned on November 7, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on November \n16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for December 3, 2007.  At the hearing the Government \npresented fourteen  exhibits.  The Applicant presented two exhibits.  He also testified on \n1 \n\nhis own behalf.  The record was left open until close of business on December 13, \n2007, to allow the Applicant to submit additional supporting documentation.  On \nDecember 10, 2007, he submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit consisting of seventeen \npages that was admitted into evidence.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on \nDecember 11, 2007. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe Applicant is 53 years old and a widower.  He has a high school diploma.  He \nis employed by a defense contractor as a Material Production Clerk, and is applying for \na security clearance in connection with his employment. \n \n \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the \nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings \nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants. \n \n \nThe Applicant admitted most of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this \nguideline.  However, with respect to allegations 1(a) and 1(b), he claims that they \ninvolve the same arrest.  Allegations 1(f) and 1(h), also concern the same incident.    \nAfter a close review of the Government\u2019s exhibits, there is no evidence in the record to \nsubstantiate allegations 1(a), and 1(h). Accordingly, allegations 1(a), and 1(h) are found \nfor the Applicant. \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s excessive use of alcohol began in about 1975/1976.  He testified \nthat in the beginning he usually consumed alcohol with friends at their homes where he \nwould drink several beers, four or five times a week.  To get to a friend\u2019s house, he \nwould usually ride a bike, walk or get a ride from someone else.  On several occasions, \nwhen he had what he believed to be too much to drink, he would spend the night at his \nfriend\u2019s house.  On other occasions, when he had only a few drinks, he would drive \nhome. \n \n \nThe Applicant was arrested and convicted for Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol in 1976 and 1977.  (See Government Exhibits 1 and 2).  Following both \nconvictions, the Applicant was fined either $200.00 or $300.00.     \n \n \nRealizing that his pattern of drinking was self-destructive, in December 1980, the \nApplicant voluntarily sought out help from his Employee Assistance Program for his \nabusive alcohol consumption.  It was recommended by the Employee Assistance \nProgram Manager that he enter a 30 day in-patient alcohol and drug treatment program.  \nThe Applicant agreed and entered the program.  From December 19, 1980 through \nJanuary 15, 1981, the Applicant received in-patient alcohol and drug rehabilitation.  At \n2 \n\nthat time he was diagnosed with drug abuse and dependence.  (See Government \nExhibit 2). \n \n \nFollowing this treatment program, the Applicant completely abstained from \nalcohol until October 1982, when his father passed away.  The Applicant then started \ndrinking intermittently, but not on a continuous basis.  (Tr. p. 45). \n \n \nFrom 1992 through 1999, the Applicant wife suffered from a debilitating condition \nthat kept her in extreme pain.  The Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol increased during \nthis time.  His wife passed away in 1999. \n \n \n \nIn February 1995, the Applicant was charged with Drunk Driving involving alcohol \n/drugs and Drunk Driving 10% or above.  He pled guilty to Drunk Driving and was \nsentenced to 180 days in county jail, (suspended) placed on summary probation for five \nyears, and fined approximately $500.00.  In lieu of the 180 days in county jail the \nApplicant did 15 days in a work release program.    \n \n \n \nOn January 2, 1996, the Applicant was suspended (he was not fired as alleged in \nthe SOR) from his job with a defense contractor when he reported to work under the \ninfluence of alcohol.  The Applicant testified that he did not consume alcohol at work. He \nhad been drinking the night before until early in the morning, went to bed for a short \ntime and then got up and went to work.  A co-worker smelled alcohol on his breath.  (Tr. \np. 57).  The Applicant was required to complete alcohol counseling program and to \nsubmit to random drug/alcohol testing.     \n \n \nIn September 1996, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DUI, (2) \nDriving with .08% or More Alcohol in Blood and (3) Reckless Driving.  The Applicant\u2019s \nblood alcohol level was .11%.  He pled guilty to Reckless Driving and was sentenced to \nthree years probation, 15 days in custody and fines and fees totaling $864.00.  (See \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Government Exhibit 8).  The Applicant testified that he did not \nspend 15 days in custody.   \n \n \nFrom January 10 1997, through February 28, 1997, the Applicant attended a 30 \nday out-patient treatment program.  Following this treatment program he completely \nabstained from alcohol for about a year and a half before he started drinking again.  \n(See Government Exhibit 2).   \n \n \nIn October or November 2002, the Applicant was charged with (1) Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol, (2) Speeding, and (3) Not Driving in Proper Lane.  He pled no \ncontest to Not Driving In Proper Lane.  The Applicant admits that he had consumed one \ndrink of alcohol before the arrest and his blood alcohol level was .04%.  The charges \nagainst him were ultimately dismissed.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B and Government \nExhibit 6). \n   \n \nSince his last arrest for DUI in November 2002, the Applicant has been trying to \nreduce his alcohol consumption.  He believes that he now drinks in a responsible \n3 \n\n4 \nmanner.  During an interview by a Special Agent from the Defense Security Service on \nSeptember 6, 2006, the Applicant stated that he consumed alcohol two to three times \nweekly.  The Applicant states that he currently drinks about once a week and has only \ntwo beers.  (Tr. p. 85).  He is not involved in any treatment program or Alcoholics \nAnonymous.      \n \n \nSeventeen letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from \nhis company security officer, supervisor, coworkers, friends and family attest to the \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good judgment, responsible and hardworking nature.  They \nall recommend him for a position of trust.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies \ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying \nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case: \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.   \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern: \n \n \n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent;  \n \n \n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent. \n \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \nNone. \n \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in \nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should \nconsider the following general factors: \n \n \na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances \n \n \nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation \n\n \n5 \n \n \n  \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct \n \n \nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct \n \n \ne. The voluntariness of participation \n \n \nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior \nchanges \n \n \ng. The motivation for the conduct  \n \n \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress \n \n \ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal \ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, \nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. \n \n \nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted \nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative \nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person \nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative \nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical \nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions \nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized \nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to \ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information \ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore \nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for \nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or \nunreliability. \n \n \nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support \nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the \ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation \nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The \nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance. \n \n \nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the \nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor \njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of \nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or \nconnection with his security clearance eligibility. \n \n \nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive \nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the \nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR. \n \n \nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, \nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and, \n22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent\u201d apply. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly \nGuideline G is found against the Applicant.  \n \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse began over 30 years ago and has \nresulted in at least three arrests for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, the most \nrecent of which occurred in 2002.  Although there is no formal diagnosis in the record of \nalcohol dependence, the Applicant sought out help for his alcohol abuse, and attended, \nparticipated in, and received both a 30 day in-patient program and a 30-day outpatient \ntreatment program.  Following his arrests for DUI, and after his two alcohol rehabilitation \nprograms, he completely abstained from the use of alcohol for a period of time.  He is \ncommended for these efforts.  However, with the stress of everyday life, as well as \nsome very devastating circumstances including his father\u2019s death and his wife\u2019s long \npainful illness and her eventual death, he has returned to drinking, and was \nsubsequently charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  He has not made \nthe commitment to stop.  At this time, he is not working a structured recovery program \nthat includes Alcohol Anonymous meetings or any other program, and has not been \nable to stay alcohol free.  He continues to drink, although he believes that he is now \ndrinking responsibly.  He is not on the right road to recovery.  Based upon his long \nhistory of alcohol abuse and its related effects on the Applicant there is insufficient \nevidence in the record to show that he is sufficiently trustworthy, or that he will not \nreturn to his old ways.       \n \n \nI have also carefully considered the favorable words from his security officer, \nsupervisor, co-workers, family and friends, but that evidence does not come close to \nmitigating the negative effect of his numerous alcohol related arrests.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the \nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.   Accordingly, the \nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary \nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR. \n \n      \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as \nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1:  \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.a.: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.b.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.c.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.d.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.e.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.f.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.g.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.h.: \nFor the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.i.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.j.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.k.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n    Subpara.  1.l.: \nAgainst the Applicant. \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nthe Applicant. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nDarlene Lokey-Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On June 11, 2008, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph Testan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\nwere supported by substantial record evidence.  We also construe Applicant\u2019s appeal as asserting that\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, which included two\njudgements rendered against her in favor of creditors.  The total amount of the debts is nearly\n$8,000.00.  In July 2006, while filling out her security clearance application (SCA), Applicant\nprovided false information in response to three questions.

She stated to a government investigator\nthat she did so because of concern over \u201crepercussions from her job supervisor and/or security\nofficer.\u201d  Decision at 2.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 29, 2007, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 8, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\nNo such statement was on the EQNSP. \n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant is indebted in the approximate amount of $4,740.00 to an individual as\na result of a judgement entered against her in 2003.\nApplicant is indebted to Capitol One Bank in the approximate amount of $925.00\nas a result of a judgment entered against her in 2001.\nApplicant is indebted to Pallino in the approximate amount of $862.00.

She has struggled since then while\nrasing her two children without child support from the husband. Her financial difficulties\nwere compounded by several periods of unemployment.\nApplicant completed an electronic questionnaire for national security positions\n(EQNSP) in July 2006. In response to three questions on the EQNSP, applicant\nintentionally provided false, material information. Specifically, in response to Question\n28A, she denied that in the prior seven years she had been over 180 days delinquent\non any debt; in response to Question 28B, she denied she was then over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debts; and in response to Question 29, she denied that in the prior\nseven years she had any judgments against her that had not been paid. As documented\nabove, applicant was well over 180 days delinquent on numerous debts, including two\njudgment debts from 2001 and 2003, when she completed the EQNSP. During a\nDecember 2006 interview with an OPM investigator, applicant stated she didn\u2019t list her\ndebts on the EQNSP because she feared \u201crepercussions from her job supervisor and/or\nsecurity officer.\u201d In her response to the SOR, she stated she didn\u2019t list the debts or\njudgments because (1) she was rushing to complete the EQNSP and was concentrating\non her job history, (2) because of her 2001 interview with an investigator, she knew the\nGovernment was aware of her debts, and (3) she thought she had put down on the\nEQNSP that she \u201cwould discuss [her debts] with interviewer.\u201d   This was not the first\n1\ntime applicant falsified material facts on a DoD security questionnaire. On an April 1999\nsecurity clearance application (SCA), she denied having any financial problems when, in\nfact, she had numerous delinquent debts, including judgment debts, outstanding.\n\n3\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\n\n4\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a long history of an inability\nor unwillingness to pay her debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to honor her\nfinancial obligations is both recent and frequent. This fact, and the fact the evidence\ndoes not support a finding that her financial difficulties are likely to be resolved anytime\nsoon, precludes application of this mitigation condition.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were arguably largely the result of factors beyond her\ncontrol; namely, her divorce and numerous periods of unemployment. However, it is\nimpossible to conclude she acted responsibly under the circumstances for at least two\nreasons. First, she has made no payments on any of her long-standing past-due debts\neven though she has been gainfully employed since 2003. Second, in 2006 she either\npurchased a new home or refinanced her then current home by taking out two new\nmortgages. These two mortgages total approximately $350,000.00, and require\napplicant to make monthly payments totaling approximately $2,500.00. According to a\nJuly 2007 financial statement completed by applicant, when these mortgage payments\nare factored in, she has a net monthly cash flow of less than $60.00, and this $60.00\nfigure assumes a monthly $200.00 to $400.00 contribution from her mother and no\npayments to her delinquent creditors. Under the circumstances, obtaining these two\nmortgages does not evince responsibility. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. This mitigation condition does not apply.\nParagraph 20.d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has\nmade statements that she will begin making payments on her delinquent debts but has\nnot provided any proof that she has actually done so. This mitigating condition does not\napply.\n\n5\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false,\nmaterial information on an EQNSP.\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nhas a history of not meeting her financial obligations. In addition, she lied to the\nGovernment in July 2006 when she denied any delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s inability or\nunwillingness to honor her financial obligations and to be truthful about them is serious\n\n6\nand recent. Her failure to offer credible evidence that her financial difficulties are unlikely\nto continue, and her incredible denial of an intent to deceive the Government about her\nfinancial condition when completing the EQNSP, preclude findings that her financial\ndifficulties will not recur and she is unlikely to provide false information to the\nGovernment in the future. Based on the foregoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from Guidelines E and F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant=s written answer to the SOR is dated July 24, 2008. On September 18, \n2008, he requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \n \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 26, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nOn September 18, 2008, Department Counsel submitted the Department=s \nwritten case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to \nthe Applicant on September 23, 2008. He was given the opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the file \non October 15, 2008.  Applicant did not file a response to the FORM within the 30 day \ntime allowed that would have expired on November 14, 2008. I received the case \nassignment on December 12, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 24, 2008, Applicant admitted all the factual \nallegations of the SOR, except in & 1.d, and offered explanations for his admissions and \ndenial. \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, married, has one child, and works for a defense \ncontractor.  He served 11 years on active Navy duty.  He worked for defense \ncontractors after his Navy service, but was unemployed from June 2004 until August \n2004 and then again from November 2004 until May 2005. (Item 4) \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2004.  His delinquent \ndebts, secured and unsecured, listed in that bankruptcy totaled $1219,171.  Some debts \ndated from 1993.  In May 2005, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed Applicant\u2019s petition \nbecause he failed to make the payments according to the bankruptcy plan, which would \nhave required Applicant to make 60 payments of $535 monthly, for a total of $32,100.  \n(Items 2, 16-20) \n \nNext, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2005. His total \nliabilities came to $154,261.  The creditors included payday loan companies, credit card \ndebts, signature loans, and debts for returned checks based insufficient funds in \nApplicant\u2019s checking account, among other liabilities.  The bankruptcy payment plan \nrequired Applicant to pay $325 for four months, then $443 for 56 months, totaling \n$26,108.  On May 24, 2007, the trustee moved to dismiss Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy action because Applicant failed to make these all the payments.  This action \nwas postponed, but finally it was dismissed in July 2008 for failure to make the \nbankruptcy payments.  Applicant paid only $12,154 under that plan until dismissal \noccurred.  The 14 delinquent debts in the plan were again due after dismissal, and \nthose debts totaled $122,361.  (Items 2, 11-15) \n \nApplicant owes a wireless telephone service $1,591.  This debt has not been \npaid. (Items 2, 7, 8) \n \nApplicant owes $51 to a telephone company.  While Applicant denies this debt, it \ndoes appear on his September 17, 2008, credit report.  It was placed for collection in \nSeptember 2007. The debt has not been repaid. (Items 2, 7, 8) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nA medical account debt of $225 remains unpaid.  Applicant admitted this debt.  It \nwas first placed for collection in 2005.  His September 17, 2008, credit report shows the \ndebt as unresolved. (Items 2, 7-9) \n \nApplicant admitted his $275 delinquent debt to a cable television service \nprovider.  This debt was first placed for collection in September 2004.  The September \n17, 2008, credit report shows the debt as unpaid. (Items 2, 7, 12, 19) \n \nThe $6,111 debt is a student loan which Applicant admits owing.  Applicant \nclaims the debt is \u201crescinded\u201d and he is paying $120 to a collection agency for this debt.  \nThe documents he supplied with his Answer show a $120 payment in July 2008.  This \npayment was made with Applicant\u2019s debit card.  There is no evidence of any payments \nbefore July 2008, or of any after.  (Items 2, 7) \n \nThe five delinquent debts listed in the SOR, without the inclusion of any debts \nlisted in the two attempts to complete Chapter 13 bankruptcy actions, total $8,967.  The \ntotal of debts from the 2005 bankruptcy and the five specific debts alleged total \n$131,326, none of which have been paid or resolved.  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201dThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt since 1993 that \nhe has not resolved.  Finally, AG \u00b6 19 (e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d applies because Applicant\u2019s total \nindebtedness is $131,326. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where \nAthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ There is no evidence to support the application of this \ncondition. AG \u00b6 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d might apply if Applicant paid either of his Chapter \n13 bankruptcy actions according to the plan, but he failed to accomplish those tasks.  \nHe has not paid them, and offers no reasonable, good-faith explanation as to why he \nhas not paid these debts listed in the SOR, or was unable to complete his two Chapter \n13 bankruptcy filings. The burden of proof is on him to show that the mitigating \nconditions should apply to him.  He failed in this burden.  I do not find these two \npotentially mitigating conditions are a factor for consideration in this case.  There are no \nother mitigating conditions raised by the evidence.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recentcy of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. It is unclear from Applicant=s \nanswers when and how his financial problems arose, and what were the bases for these \ndebts which are now delinquent. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) Applicant does not explain in any \ndetail how his debts occurred, what efforts he made to repay them, except for his \nincomplete Chapter 13 actions and the one payment on his student loans, or how he \nintends to avoid such problems in the future. (See AG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant provided no \ninformation concerning behavioral changes to remedy the situation.  Applicant owes \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n$131,326 and has not demonstrated any efforts to repay these debts, including a $51 \nphone bill. (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  The potential for coercion, exploitation or duress exists \nbecause of the size of the debt, which will affect his credit ratings,  could cause him to \ntake advantage of any method to extricate himself from this predicament, including \ncoercive methods by other persons. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Applicant voluntarily incurred \nthese debts, and it is likely he will continue in his inability to repay them based on the \nevidence in this file. (See AG & 2(a)(5) and (9).) \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as \nto Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

However, Applicant maintains his Tunisian passport and \nhas failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concern under Guideline C, \nforeign preference. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \n \n1\nMay 14, 2008\n\nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 15, 2007, detailing security \nconcerns under Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  \n  \n \nOn August 23, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On December 14, 2007, I was assigned the case. On \nMarch 12, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on \nMarch 26, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was kept open \nto allow Applicant to submit additional matters which were received on March 31, 2008. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the material and it was admitted into evidence as \nExs.

On April 11, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Tunisia. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx.)

(Tr. 62) When Applicant lived in \nTunisia, he returned to the U.S. every other year, spending a month to six weeks visiting \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2\n\nhis grandparents during the summer. (Tr. 27) His mother\u2019s father was an accountant \nand his mother\u2019s mother did not work outside the home. (Tr. 66) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father worked in human resources for an oil company, taught English \nat a university, and was involved in agriculture. (Tr. 63) He is now retired and raises \nbees. (Tr. 63) Applicant does not know where his father is. (Tr. 50) Since his parents \ndivorced in 2003, Applicant has maintained no contact with his father. (Tr. 51) His \nmother, who has lived in Tunisia more than 30 years, chose to remain in Tunisia \nfollowing the divorce. (Tr. 23) She has mentioned returning to the U.S. permanently. (Tr. \n50) Applicant\u2019s mother visited him from Christmas time until February. (Tr. 50) \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers, grandmother, uncles and everyone on his mother\u2019s side of the \nfamily live in the same state he does. (Tr. 35)  \n \nAt age 19, Applicant returned to the U.S. to attend school. He visited Tunisia \nduring the summers or during Christmas breaks at school. (Tr. 40) He traveled to \nTunisia during July and August 1998, December 1999 and January 2000, July and \nAugust 2001, December2001 and January 2002, and July and August 2004.  \n \n \nApplicant has a Tunisian passport issued in October 2003, which will expire in \nOctober 2008. He last used this passport on his 2004 trip to Tunisia. He used his U.S. \npassport for travel to Tunisia. (Tr. 38) He uses his U.S. passport for all travel except \nwhen visiting Tunisia. (Tr. 41) Upon leaving Tunisia he will show both his U.S. and \nTunisian passports. (Tr. 41) In June 2007, when Applicant completed written \ninterrogatories (Ex. 2), he stated he had no intention of giving up his Tunisian passport. \nHe maintains his Tunisian passport for ease of travel when visiting Tunisia. Applicant \nplans on visiting his relatives in Tunisia every three years. (Tr. 21)  \n \nIn May 1996, Applicant obtained his bachelors degree in electrical engineering \nfrom a U.S. state university. In December 2001, Applicant married a woman born in \nTunisia who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 2006. They have two children, \nages one and five, both born in the U.S. His wife is an accountant. They own a home \nworth approximately $170,000 on which is owed $117,000. (Ex. 3, Ex. C, Ex. D)  \n \nApplicant has approximately $11,500 in a credit union saving account, $7,500 in \nhis checking account, and $9,000 in share certificates. (Ex. E) He has $100,000 in his \ncompany 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 30) Applicant and his wife have $9,000 in a \nsavings account in Tunisia. (Tr. 31) It is a special account for housing purchases. (Tr. \n32) He no longer adds to that account because he has reached the maximum amount \nallowable for that account.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a Tunisian citizen who is a retired civil engineer. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a Tunisian citizen who is retired from the banking industry. \n(Ex. 3) Applicant talks with them weekly. Applicant has two brothers-in-law, one of \nwhom is a computer engineer. The other is a college student. (Tr. 66) One brother-in-\nlaw lives in Canada and the other is about to move there. (Tr. 47) Within the last six \nmonths, his parents-in-law stayed with Applicant and his family for three months before \n \n3\n\nvisiting Canada. Upon their return from Canada, they stayed with Applicant and his \nfamily for another four months, leaving two weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 47)  \n \n \nApplicant has never voted in a foreign election. (Tr. 22, 42) He owns no foreign \nproperty. (Tr.29) Applicant has no loyalty to the Tunisian government (Tr. 58)  \n \n \nTunisia \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Tunisia is a republic with a \nstrong presidential system dominated by a single political party. There are eight legal \nopposition parties. Progress toward full democracy has been slow. The current \npresident has stood unopposed for re-election several times. In 1974 he was made \n\u201cPresident for Life\u201d by a constitutional amendment. (HExs. II and V) Tunisia has a long-\ntime policy of seeking good relations with the West, including the Unites States, while \nplaying an active role in Arab and African regional bodies. (HExs. II and V)  \n \nThe Department of States warns Tunisia has open borders with Libya and \nAlgeria. During late 2002 and early 2003, a number of tourists were kidnapped in the \nSahara desert. In April 2002, tourists were also attacked by terrorists and in January \n2007, another terrorist attack on tourists was disrupted. (HExs. I and IV) In light of the \nreported kidnappings of two western tourists in the Tunisian-Algerian southern desert \nregion, the Department of State advises U.S. citizens to exercise extreme caution if \ntraveling in this area. (HEx. VII) \n \nThe Tunisian government continues to commit serious human rights abuses \nwhich include infringement on citizens\u2019 privacy rights, severe restriction on freedom of \nspeech and the press, and restriction on the freedom of assembly and association. \n(HExs. III and VI) There are frequent reports of widespread torture and abuse of \nprisoners, especially political prisoners. Tunisian security forces arbitrarily arrest and \ndetain individuals. (HExs. III and VI) \n \nAmerican citizens of Tunisian origin are expected to enter and exit Tunisia on \ntheir Tunisian passports. If a Tunisian-American enters on a U.S. passport, they will still \nhave to present a Tunisian passport to exit the country. (HExs. I and IV)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n \n4\n\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \nForeign preference is a security concern because, when an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, he \nor she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States. AG & 9. Additionally, the possession or use of a foreign \npassport is a condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. AG \n& 10(a) (1) Applicant has a Tunisian passport, which he used when visiting Tunisia. He \nhas no intention of giving up his Tunisian passport. (Ex. 2) I find AG 10(a) (1) applies.  \n \n \n5\n\n \n6\nApplicant used his Tunisian passport in compliance with requirements stated in \nthe Consular Information Sheet: Tunisia, U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular \nAffairs, dated October 3, 2007 and February 5, 2008. (HExs. I and IV) By Tunisian law, \nAmerican citizens of Tunisian origin are expected to enter and exit Tunisia on their \nTunisian passports. If a Tunisian-American enters on a U.S. passport, they will still have \nto present a Tunisian passport to exit the country. AG & 11(d) states it may be a \nmitigating condition if \u201cuse of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority.\u201d Compliance with advisements set forth in the Consular Information Sheet: \nTunisia is not equivalent to approval by a cognizant security authority. AG & 11(d) does \nnot apply nor, as discussed below, do any of the other mitigating conditions under this \nguideline. \n  \nAG & 11(e) sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns if the \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated. Surrendering his passport to his company\u2019s security officer and \nobtain it when he intends to travel to Tunisia might meet the requirements set forth in \nAG & 11(d). The passport would have been surrendered to a \u201ccognizant security \nauthority,\u201d and would be beyond Applicant\u2019s control to the same extent as if one of the \nnamed events had occurred.  \n \nThe government has a number of concerns when an individual possesses a \nforeign passport. First, the government\u2019s knowledge of that individual\u2019s travel once they \nleave the U.S. would be severely limited. Second, the government would have no way \nof preventing that individual from leaving the country. In an appropriate case, an \nindividual with a U.S. passport could have that passport cancelled or revoked to prevent \nflight from the U.S. When a person possesses a foreign passport, the government\u2019s \nability to prevent flight from the U.S. is greatly reduced.  \n \nIf the Tunisian passport was under the control of the company\u2019s security officer \nand Applicant had to retrieve it before traveling to Tunisia, there would be a greater \ndegree of control over Applicant\u2019s travel. It is not certain that it would result in mitigating \nthe security concern, but would be considered in making the determination as to \nwhether a security concern existed. The entire matter is speculative because Applicant \nmaintains control of his Tunisian passport and has not surrendered it to his company\u2019s \nsecurity officer or other cognizant security authority.  \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, \nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign \ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG & 6 \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nThe terrorists in Tunisia are not government supported terrorists. Tunisia is not \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. Applicant does not have \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests. The $9,000 Tunisian account Applicant \nand his wife have is deminimus when compared to Applicant\u2019s U.S. assets. \n \nI have considered the foreign influence disqualifying conditions, which are listed \nunder AG & 7. I find AG & 7(a) \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d and AG & 7(b) \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual=s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens and residents of \nTunisia and are all retired. His mother is a dual U.S. and Tunisian citizen living in \nTunisia. Normally, an individual\u2019s relationship with their father is a close relationship. \nHowever, in this case, Applicant is not close to his father. Since his parent\u2019s 2003 \ndivorce, Applicant has had no contact with his father and is unsure of his father\u2019s \nlocation. Applicant talks to his in-laws weekly, but is not overly close to them.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother was born and raised in the U.S. She married a Tunisian, \nmoved there, and has lived there more than 30 years. Her parents and siblings reside in \nthe same state Applicant does. Applicant\u2019s two brothers also live in the U.S. in the same \ncity where Applicant lives.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.,\u201d and AG \u00b6 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual=s sense of loyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s parents and in-laws.  \n \nApplicant was born in the U.S. and lived here until age seven. From age 7 until \n19 he lived in Tunisia, but returned to the U.S. every two or three years to visit his \nmother\u2019s relatives. At age 19, he returned to the U.S. to attend school and has \nremained. His wife was born in Tunisia but is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Both of his \nchildren were born in the U.S. Applicant owns a home in the U.S. Because of these \nthings there is little likelihood Applicant has a conflict of interest. If there was a conflict \nhis longstanding loyalty to the U.S. makes it likely the conflict would be resolved it in \nfavor of the U.S.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI also considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in the U.S., \nleft the country at age seven, and returned in 1991, at age 19 to attend college, and has \nremained since. His wife, children, brothers, and his mother\u2019s family all reside in the \nU.S. He is an established, highly regarded engineer, with considerable U.S. ties and \nassets.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Tunisia and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country. None of his \nrelatives are connected to any foreign government. Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest at the hearing. It is unlikely his parents or in-laws will be subjected to coercion or \nduress from terrorist groups or the Tunisian government. His relatives art not a security \nconcern.  \n \nHowever, Applicant maintains his Tunisian passport so he can travel to Tunisia. \nThis is a security concern that has not been mitigated. Even with Applicant\u2019s deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S., including his uncompromising \ncommitment to his country, wife, and children, the possession of the foreign passport \nremains of security concern.  \n \nDue to possession of the foreign passport, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns, but not the foreign preference concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

On October 25, 2007, I was assigned the case. On \nNovember 13, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing for November 29, 2007. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional matters. Additional documents were received on December 21, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the material and it was admitted into evidence as \nEx. A. On December 7, 2007, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nName Change  \n \nFollowing the issuance of the SOR, Applicant married.

At the time, she was living pay check to pay check. Her son is now 14 \nyears old and his asthma condition has substantially improved. (Tr. 48) \n \nIn February 1998, Applicant\u2014then age 20\u2014filed for Chapter 13, Wage Earner\u2019s \nPlan, bankruptcy protection. The debts included medical bills for her son\u2019s asthma \n \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\ntreatment and treatment for her back problems. (Tr. 24) The plan required her to make \nmonthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee. She was unable to make the monthly \npayments and in May 1998, the bankruptcy was dismissed. She refilled for Chapter 13 \nprotection in June 1998, and it was dismissed in July 1999. She had made payments for \n13 months before the second bankruptcy was dismissed. In 2000, Applicant underwent \ngallbladder surgery and was unable to work, which contributed to her medical debts and \nfinancial problems. \n \n \nA friend lent her money to purchase a car, which was later involved in a wreck. In \nAugust 2005, the friend obtained a $6,000 judgment against Applicant. In July 2007, \nApplicant sent a letter to the creditor holding the $6,000 judgment listed in \u00b6 1.c, \nindicating she would like to arrange payments on the debt. The attorney for the creditor \nindicated his records had been destroyed by a hurricane. Applicant intends to pay this \ndebt. \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant completed a personal financial statement, which listed \nher gross net monthly income at $1,810 and her net monthly remainder at $190. She \nhas recently married and received a salary increase. Her salary increase was $2.50 per \nhour, which represents a 15 percent raise. (Tr.48) Applicant no longer has a $200 per \nmonth car loan, the car having been recently paid off. (Tr. 49) For the past two years, \nApplicant has had a garnishment of her wages, taking $75 from her pay every two \nweeks to pay the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.s. She has contacted all of the creditors listed in \nthe SOR. (Ex 2) \n \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had applied for a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) \nloan. (Tr. 43) On December 11, 2007 she received the loan, at a 4.5 percent interest \nrate, which provided her with $18,950, and she used it to pay all the debts listed in the \nSOR.  \n \nThe SOR lists a judgment and 22 accounts charged off or placed for collection as listed \nin her credit reports. (Exs. 3, 4) The debts total approximately $17,000. Half of the \naccounts are for debts less than $200 and 83 per cent of her debts are obligations of \nless than $500 each. Only six of her debts exceed $500 each.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \n\n \n \n \n5\n                                                          \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial \nobligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $17,000 on 23 past due obligations. \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial problems were contributed to by her son\u2019s asthma. Not only were medical \nexpenses incurred, but Applicant lost time from work to obtain treatment for her son.  \n \nFrequently medical problems associated with asthma are lessened as children \nget older. This is the case with Applicant\u2019s son for his asthma condition has substantially \nimproved. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt due her medical issues, her \nson\u2019s medical issues, and reduced income from having to obtain treatment. These \ncircumstances are no longer extant. I find the behavior occurred under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. This mitigating condition applies.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n6\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from her and her son\u2019s medical problems, including the \nsubstantial medical bills and her loss of income due to having to take time off to take her \nson to treatment. She acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find \nthis mitigating condition applies.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has received a $18,950 TSP loan and resolved her \ndelinquent debts. Documents showing payment to each creditor have not been \nsupplied. However, after hearing her testimony, observing her demeanor, and \nevaluating all the evidence of record, I found her testimony credible that she would use \nthe TSP loan to pay her bills. She is now married, has received a substantial raise in \npay, and has an additional $200 per month each month now that her vehicle is paid off. \nShe is now financially sound and prepared for future contingencies. I conclude these \npotentially mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was very young woman. Her son was born when she was 15. She was a \nsingle mother. Mounting medical bills resulted in her\u2500then age 20\u2500filing for bankruptcy \nprotection. She was able to make her payments for more than a year before she was \nunable to continue with the monthly payments. She accumulated debt due to \n\n \n \n \n7\ncircumstances largely beyond her control, including time off from work to take her son to \ntreatment and large, unexpected medical expenses. (See AG & 2(a)(2).)  \n \nThe debts incurred were not the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Money was not spent \nfrivolously. The debts were not incurred on luxuries, but were for medical treatment, \nflood clean up, and needed transportation. The modest amounts spent on the vehicles \npurchased fails to show extravagance on Applicant\u2019s part or living beyond her means. \n \nSince the filing of her bankruptcy, medical bills and loss of time from work have \ncontinued, but Applicant has undergone significant changes in her life including \nmarriage and salary increases. Most significantly, she has taken affirmative action to \npay or resolve the delinquent debts raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) \nThese debts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is \nnot simply whether all her debts are paid\u2014it is whether her financial circumstances \nraise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.y: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 26, 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nJanuary 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as modified \nDecember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nand revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and it recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nOn February 2, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJuly 24, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 31, 2009. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on August 25, 2009. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, presented three witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 5, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 1, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6 1, except for SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nwhich he denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor \nand testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old program manager in charge of his employer\u2019s logistics \nsupport for defense contractors. His father was an American service member and \nfought in World War Two. Applicant graduated from college in 1973, and received a \nBachelor of Arts degree in political science. He completed his Master of Arts degree in \n1976. After college, he received a Reserve Officer Training Corps commission. He \nstarted his service as a nuclear missile launch officer. Later, Applicant became a fighter \npilot. In 1991, he flew combat missions during the Desert Storm War and was awarded \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism in combat. \n \nBetween 1999 and 2001, Applicant was assigned to a North African country as \nthe Defense Attach\u00e9 to an American Embassy. In 2001, he retired honorably from the \nservice after achieving the rank of colonel. He held access to classified information \nduring all his time in the military. Outside of the SOR allegations, Applicant\u2019s military \nrecord is unblemished. There is no evidence that he was ever involved in any additional \nquestionable behavior while in the military, or since his retirement in 2001. After his \nretirement, Applicant worked for two defense contractors. He has worked for his current \nemployer since July 2002. \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) directed application of revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines in all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. \n1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant married his wife in 1973, and they have two adult children. His \ndaughter is an officer and a pilot in the military. She has flown combat missions in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. His son works for a government agency.  \n \nIn August 2001, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He received a reprimand and forfeiture of \n$3,000 pay per month for two months ($2,000 suspended). He was found guilty of:  \n \n(a) Dereliction of duty (a violation of Article 92 (UCMJ)), because he allowed \nofficial vehicles to be used for non-authorized purposes \u2013 the transportation of his cook, \nbetween her residence and her place of employment. Applicant explained that, at the \ntime, he erroneously believed he was using the official vehicles for authorized purposes \nbecause he followed the same course of conduct as his predecessors. He admitted that \nhis improper use of the vehicles violated service rules and regulations. \n \n(b) Dereliction of duty (a violation of Article 92 (UCMJ), because he willfully failed \nto report continuing personal contact with a foreign national as it was his duty to do. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted that he knew he was required to report to the \nDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA) any continuing personal contact with a foreign \nnational. He hired an unmarried foreign national woman to be his French instructor. The \nwoman visited, and usually stayed overnight at Applicant\u2019s residence in the U.S. \nEmbassy compound at least three weekends per month from May 2000 to March 2001. \nApplicant willfully failed to report his continuing personal contact with his French \ninstructor, because he was concerned about the adverse impact such reports would \nhave on the foreign national. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his continuing personal contact with a foreign national \nviolated DIA security rules and procedures. The country to which Applicant was \nassigned had extreme security concerns because of the threat of a terrorist attack. \nApplicant acknowledged that his failure to report his continuing personal contact with a \nforeign national was a serious error in judgment. He has learned his lesson, and \npromised that if he was ever again in the same situation, he would report the contact. \n \n(c) Conduct unbecoming an officer (a violation of Article 133 (UCMJ)), because \nhe engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a woman who was not his wife. \nApplicant denied he ever engaged in a sexual relationship with his French instructor. He \nadmitted, however, that his behavior and contact with the French instructor was \nimproper. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged that Applicant improperly allowed a foreign national to enter \nthe U.S. Embassy Compound. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows, however, that he submitted \nvisitor notification forms to the Embassy Regional Security Office and to the State \nDepartment, as he was required to do every time the French instructor visited the \nEmbassy. I find this allegation for Applicant. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn his March 2006 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he \nreceived non-judicial punishment in August 2001, and that he received a reprimand. He \nalso identified the command that imposed the non-judicial punishment. SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleged that during a September 2006 interview, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nto the investigator that he was issued non-judicial punishment for offenses that included \nconduct unbecoming an officer.  \n \nThe September 2006 personal subject interview (GE 2) indicates that Applicant \ndiscussed with the investigator two of the non-judicial punishment specification against \nhim: his improper use of an official vehicle and his failure to report his continuing \npersonal conduct with a foreign national. There is no mention of the third allegation, that \nApplicant engaged in conduct unbecoming an officer by entering into an improper \nrelationship with a woman not his wife. \n \nApplicant presented five character letters for consideration, including a letter from \nthe U.S. Ambassador under whom he served as Defense Attach\u00e9 during the period in \nquestion. In her 2001 letter, the Ambassador stated that Applicant consistently \nconducted himself in a highly professional, competent, and dedicated manner. She \nhighly valued his advice and counsel. She considered Applicant\u2019s service a credit to the \nU.S. Government. She noted that Applicant was awarded a Department of State \nMeritorious Honor Award for his outstanding work, a rare honor for a non-foreign service \nofficer. Applicant was not relieved of his Defense Attach\u00e9 position as a result of the \ncircumstances that led to his non-judicial punishment. Neither DIA nor his service \nrevoked Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \nA senior special agent with the Department of State Office of Diplomatic Security \ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He was the Deputy Regional Security Officer at the same \nembassy during the period Applicant engaged in the conduct alleged in the SOR. His \njob was to oversee the security of the embassy and the local guard program. To his \nknowledge, Applicant always filed the proper forms and notices to request foreign \nnationals be allowed to enter the Embassy compound. Applicant never allowed his \nFrench instructor to improperly access the Embassy compound. \n \nApplicant has been successful working for two government contractors since his \nretirement in 2001. All of Applicant\u2019s references consider Applicant to be honest, \ntrustworthy, and of high moral character. He was commended for his judgment, \nmaturity, work ethic, and overall performance. All of his references recommended \nwithout reservations that he receive access to classified information.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified he never had any intent to falsify his 2006 statement \nto a government investigator. Because of his experience in the service, he knew that the \ngovernment always keeps records of non-judicial punishments to officers. He loved his \ncareer in the service. He is proud that his father fought in World War Two, and that his \ndaughter is currently a pilot flying combat missions. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nFrom about May 2000 to March 2001, while serving as a Defense Attach\u00e9 to a \nU.S. Embassy, Applicant was derelict in the performance of his duties by using a \ngovernment vehicle for unauthorized purposes. He also failed to follow security rules \nand procedures when he willfully failed to report to DIA his continuing personal conduct \nwith a foreign national. Additionally, he wrongfully entered into an inappropriate \nrelationship with a woman who was not his wife. At a minimum, he created the \nappearance of impropriety.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n16(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations;\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), \nand 17(e) all apply, at least in part, to the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s failure to follow \nsecurity rules and regulations, particularly when they concerned the security of an \nEmbassy compound, constituted a serious offense. Notwithstanding, the seriousness of \nhis actions, I find his behavior to be remote. It occurred approximately eight years ago, \nand under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. After his retirement, Applicant \nreturned to the country in question as an employee of a government contractor. There is \nno evidence to show he continued with his questionable behavior with respect to the \nforeign national.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father fought in Europe during World War II. Applicant honorably \nserved 28 years in the military, and achieved the rank of colonel. He served in combat \nmissions and was awarded the Distinguish Flying Cross for heroism in battle. Except for \nthe allegations in the current SOR, there is no evidence of any other blemish on \nApplicant\u2019s military career, or that he has otherwise failed to follow rules and \nregulations, or violated security procedures. His daughter is a captain in the service and \nhas flown combat missions in the Middle East. These facts are indicative of Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and reliability. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his inappropriate behavior and expressed sincere \nremorse for his actions. He promised never to violate security rules and procedures in \nthe future. Applicant\u2019s wife, colleagues, friends, and employers know about his \ninappropriate behavior. As such, he is not professionally vulnerable to exploitation or \nduress. He is happily married to his long-time wife and is stable. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.b, I find the personal subject interview, by itself, is not \nsufficient to show Applicant lied to the investigator. Applicant disclosed in his March \n2006, security clearance application that he received non-judicial punishment in August \n2001, and was issued a reprimand. The September 2006 personal subject interview \n(GE 2) indicates that Applicant discussed, at least in part, the non-judicial punishment \nallegations with the investigator. Available information does not show that Applicant \nintended to make a false statement or to conceal information about his conduct.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. He was successful in the military and retired as a colonel after 28 years \nof honorable service to his country. He served in combat missions and was awarded the \nDistinguish Flying Cross for heroism in battle. Except for the allegations in the current \nSOR, there is no evidence of any other blemishes on Applicant\u2019s military career, or that \nhe has otherwise failed to follow rules and regulations, or violated security procedures.  \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his inappropriate behavior and expressed sincere \nremorse for his actions. He promised never to violate security rules and procedures in \nthe future. He has substantially reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation or \n\n \n9 \n \n \nduress. Since 2001, he has been successful working for two defense contractors. He \nhas established a reputation as a valuable, dedicated and reliable employee.  \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant deliberately violated security rules and procedures \nfor approximately one year notwithstanding his knowledge of the illegality of his actions \nand the risks associated with it. His failure to follow security rules and procedures is a \nserious offense. It squarely brings up the issue of whether Applicant is a security risk \nbased on his past behavior. On balance, and after considering all the evidence, I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his personal conduct. Applicant\u2019s life-long favorable evidence of \nhonorable service to his country outweighs his questionable behavior. Overall, the \nrecord evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 5, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to be proceed on June 26, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on July 28, 2008. On July 31, 2008, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2008. The case was heard \non that date. The Government offered six exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 6. The Applicant offered one exhibit which was admitted as Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A. Applicant also testified. The record was held open until September 22, \nSeptember 23, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2008 to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a \nnine-page document which was admitted without objection. The transcript was received \non September 11, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.n, but denies the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b.  \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed with his company for one year \nand 8 months. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He served on active duty, as a helicopter \npilot, in the United States Army for 27 years. He retired at the rank of Chief Warrant \nOfficer 5 on September 31, 2005. He is married and has two daughters, ages 10 and \n15. (Tr at 5-6, 23-25,51; Gov 1)  \n \nOn November 30, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing, (e-QIP), in conjunction with his employment with a \ndepartment of defense contractor.

(Gov 2.) In response to interrogatories, dated January \n\n \n3 \n \n \n25, 2008, Applicant stated that he researched the accounts, and they are his debts. He \nwas coordinating repayment arrangements with his creditors. (Gov 3.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife handled the family finances. She did not tell him about several \naccounts that became delinquent. They divorced in September 2005. Applicant admits \nto being financially irresponsible during the period when he was on his own. He and his \nwife reconciled in January 2007. Applicant did not obtain a copy of his credit report \nwhen he completed his e-QIP questionnaire. He was not aware that he had delinquent \ndebts over 90-180 days old until he was sent the financial interrogatories. He believed \nthat he was answering is e-QIP questionnaire correctly when he stated that he had no \ndebts over 90 days delinquent. (Tr at 49-55; Gov 2 at 9, 11.)   \n \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he has paid or resolved most of the delinquent \naccounts in the SOR. He was unable to locate the creditor for the $28 medical account \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The government\u2019s evidence, a credit report, listed a $29 debt for a \nmedical account. The name of the creditor was not provided. (Tr at 22.) I find for \nApplicant regarding this debt because the pleading is too vague.  \n \nApplicant states that he contacted the creditor for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.j, and 1.k. They have no records of an account and intend to remove the items from \nhis credit report. (Tr at 40-41.)  \n \nApplicant agreed to pay $500 per month towards the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m.  \nApplicant\u2019s car was repossessed in the Spring 2007. This is his largest debt. He set up \nan allotment through his bank account. (Tr at 44, 46, AE A, #4; AE B at 5,7,8.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n is the same as the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. (Tr \nat 42-43, 45.) I find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b61.n.  \n \nSufficient proof has been provided to conclude the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.l have been resolved. (AE A; AE B.) Applicant claims that \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c has been paid. (Tr at 31; AE A; AE B.) No documentation \nwas provided supporting payment. Applicant used money from his savings account and \n$8,000 received in special pay from his employer to pay the debts. (Tr at 63.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial position is stable. His net monthly take home pay is \napproximately $6,000. He receives a monthly military retirement check of approximately \n$4,000.  His total net monthly income is $10,000. He pays $2,000 a month in rent. Other \nmonthly expenses include: $400 groceries; $560 gas; $400 clothing; $400 utilities; $120 \ncar insurance; $558 auto loan; $350 truck loan, and $320 medical. Total monthly \nexpenses are approximately $5,108.  Applicant has approximately $4,892 left over each \nmonth after expenses to pay towards other bills. He is current on federal and state \ntaxes. (Tr at 59-63.) \n \nDuring his military career, Applicant has deployed to Bosnia, Somalia, \nAfghanistan, and Iraq. (Tr at 25.) His awards and decorations included the Legion of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nMerit, the Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal (3rd Award), Air Medal W/V Device, \nArmy Commendation Medal (4th Award), Army Achievement Medal (4th Award); \nValorous Unit Medal (2nd Award), Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal (2nd Award), Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (2nd Award), Southwest Asia \nService Medal with Bronze Service Star (3rd Award), Army Service Ribbon, Overseas \nService Ribbon (3rd Award), UN Medal, Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) Kuwait \nLiberation Medal (Kuwait), NATO Medal, USA Master Aviator Badge, and the Global \nWar on Terrorism Service Medal. (Tr at 24-25; AE B at 2-4.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. From 2001 to 2007, Applicant incurred \n12 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $22,243. The largest debt in \nthe amount of $17,129 relates to an automobile repossession in the spring 2007. \nApplicant\u2019s income is sufficient to meet his expenses. The financial issues appear to be \nthe result of neglect rather than an inability to pay debts. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial irresponsibility appears to have resulted from a break down in \ncommunication regarding certain bills with Applicant\u2019s wife who handled the family \nfinances.  His divorce in September 2005 more than likely added further complications. \nApplicant resolved most of the accounts and entered into a payment plan pertaining to \nhis largest debt. Although most of the payments are relatively recent, Applicant has \nsufficient income to meet his expenses.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part. Applicant\u2019s September \n2005 divorce played a part in his financial situation. He was unaware of the extent of his \ndelinquent debts until he received interrogatories in August 10, 2007. After confirming \nthe debts were valid, he took steps to resolve the accounts. He acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply with respect to financial counseling. However, there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved. Applicant paid most of the debts. He \nentered into a repayment agreement for his largest debt. His income is sufficient to \nmeet his expenses. This experience has taught Applicant to be more proactive in \ninsuring that his financial responsibilities are met.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant resolved the majority of his \ndelinquent accounts, and entered into a repayment agreement with the creditor of the \ndebt that has the highest balance.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns raised under Guideline F.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent debts in response to sections 28(a) and 28(b) on his e-QIP questionnaire, \ndated November 30, 2006. The following Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC \nDC) potentially applies to Applicant\u2019s case: PC DC \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).  \n \n \nI find that it does not apply. Applicant was not aware of the delinquent debts until \nhe was served interrogatories in conjunction with his background investigation on \nAugust 10, 2007. He states that his wife handled the family finances. Though he admits \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthat he neglected his finances when they were separated, he was not aware that he had \ndelinquent accounts more than 90/180 days delinquent when he completed his security \nclearance questionnaire. I conclude his omission was not intentional. \n \n \nI find for Applicant under the Personal Conduct concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s 27 years of \nhonorable service in the United States Army. Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent as a \nresult of neglect as opposed to a refusal or inability to pay. Applicant has taken steps to \nresolve his delinquent accounts. He earns sufficient income to meet his financial \nobligations and does not appear to live above his means. Applicant mitigated the \nconcerns raised under financial considerations based on his efforts to resolve his \naccounts. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant because he did not intentionally omit \nhis delinquent accounts on his e-QIP application.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Murphy, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n March 19, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn November 12, 2007, applicant answered the SOR in writing, and requested\nan Administrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 10, 2007. Applicant did not\nrespond to the FORM. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant was born in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1979. She became a United\nStates citizen in 1989. She received a United States passport in 2005.\nApplicant obtained her latest UK Passport in November 2006. It will expire in\n2016. She used her UK passport to travel to numerous countries, most recently in\nJanuary 2007. She does not want to give up the UK passport. As she stated in July\n2007:\nI enjoy traveling through Europe with ease and do not want to give up my\nright to live and work in the UK and EU in the future, should I choose to do\nso. (Exhibit 5).\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\n \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information.\n\n3\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10.a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nUnder Paragraph 10.b., taking action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen may also be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s renewal of her\nUK passport in 2006 requires application of these two conditions.\nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. The only one applicable\nis 11.a., which states, \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\na foreign country.\u201d\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant was born in the UK. At some point she moved to the United States with\nher parents, and while still a minor, became a United States citizen. Although her initial\nUK passport may have been obtained by her parents while she was a minor, she\nvoluntarily exercised the rights and privileges of her UK citizenship in 2006 when she\n\n4\nobtained her latest UK passport. This fact, together with her voluntary recent decisions\nto use her UK passport instead of her United States passport while traveling to various\ncountries, and her statement that she does not want to give up her UK passport\nbecause she does not want to \u201cgive up [her] right to live and work in the U.K. and EU in\nthe future\u201d if she chooses to do so, indicates a preference for the UK over the United\nStates. I therefore conclude that applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under\nGuideline C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nUnited States citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in\nthese proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and\nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nTherefore, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this\ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s\nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 18, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuideline B had not been mitigated.     In support of that contention, Applicant essentially restates\n1\nthe facts of his case and argues that the Judge did not give adequate weight to the favorable evidence.\nBased upon the record as a whole, Applicant asserts that the security concerns presented by his ties\nto Iran were outweighed by his ties to the United States and his favorable character references.\nApplicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s overall unfavorable conclusion is inconsistent with another\nhearing-level decision in which an applicant in ostensibly similar circumstances had been granted\na clearance.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Board gives due consideration to the case cited by Applicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-05903 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions\nin other hearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile her decision in this\ncase with her decision in another ostensibly similar case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2006).  \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits . . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 E2.2(b).\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09542 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08116 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007). \nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\n\n3\nApplicant with respect to several of the factual allegations.  However, she reasonably explained why\nthe evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number\nof variables to reach a commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2(c).  In some instances, this\nprocess led to favorable findings for Applicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a reasonable\nconcern that Applicant's circumstances could create a conflict of interest or be used to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure him.  That concern is based on close family ties in Iran, considered in the\ncontext of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant\noffers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that alternative interpretation\nof the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has\narticulated a rational explanation for her unfavorable determination under the disqualifying and\nmitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record evidence to support\nthat determination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side of national security.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 5 November 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR 19 November 2007, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 26 December 2007, and I convened a hearing\n5 February 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 13 February 2008.\n \nMarch 31, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for SOR 1.d.\u2014a debt he claimed\nto have paid in Summer 2006. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of\nfact. He is a 59-year-old systems and software engineer employed by a defense\ncontractor since April 2006. He seeks to retain the security clearance he has held since\n1973.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits confirm, six delinquent debts totaling\nover $16,000. Applicant admits five of the six, asserting without corroboration that he\npaid the $665 debt at SOR 1.d. in summer 2006. Applicant\u2019s answer asserts, again\nwithout corroboration that he paid two debts totaling $359 (SOR 1.b. and 1.f) in\nNovember 2007, after receiving the SOR. Applicant claims that he has been unable to\nidentify the creditor for the debt at SOR 1.a. ($122), although he is willing and able to\npay. However, he has not made any payment for the two principal debts (SOR 1.c. and\n1.e.), which have now grown to nearly $17,000 (G.E. 5). He has made no contact with\nthe creditor at 1.c.. He claims, without corroboration, to have contacted the creditor at\n1.e., but the creditor has told him to not worry about repayment. In addition, Applicant\nowes $2,000 to his aunt for a personal loan, and is $5000-6000 in arrears in child\nsupport payments to his second wife, from whom he is separated.\nApplicant ascribes his financial difficulties to a plethora of reasons: child support\nand college tuition expenses from his divorce from his first wife in May 1978, child\nsupport and college tuition expenses from his separation from his second wife in June\n2002, brief periods of unemployment (June-August 2002, May-June 2004, December\n2005-April 2006, and sometime in 2007), a longer period of underemployment (August\n2002-August 2003), a cancer diagnosis in September 2006 that resulted in surgery, and\nunanticipated automobile repairs (A.E. G, H). \nYet, despite these setbacks, Applicant\u2019s tax records (A.E. E) reflect that he\nearned over $87,000 in 2006 (including over $11,000 unemployment compensation)\nand over $76,000 in 2007 (including over $8,000 unemployment compensation). He has\nnot sought credit counseling, because of the perceived cost. He and his wife remain\nmarried because they are not able to afford the legal expenses of divorce proceedings. \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n3\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond\none\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high\ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances\n4\nthat it is  unlikely to recur . . . \n3\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Setting aside for the moment four small\ndebts each less than $700, three of which Applicant claims to have paid, government\nrecords reflect nearly $17,000 of delinquent debt that remain unaddressed, and which\ncontinue to grow.  Applicant makes a fair case that these financial problems are due to\n3\ncircumstances beyond his control. Yet, taken at face value, the financial circumstances\ncover more than 20 years even if most of the incidents seem to be since 2002. Further,\nhis finances for the last two years appear much improved, but he failed to address the\ndelinquent debts until faced with the security concerns raised by the government.\nApplicant meets only one of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  While the debts were due to\n4\ncircumstances beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly in addressing his\n\n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . .\n5\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n6\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\ndebts.  There is no evidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought\n5\nthe problem under control.  Although he may have paid some outstanding debts after\n6\nthe SOR was issued, and just before the hearing, the timing of the payments does not\nconstitute a good-faith effort to satisfy his debts.  Further, given his unwillingness to\n7\nseek or use financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant\nwill put his financial problems behind him.

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred significant debt which has not been paid. While some of the debt is due\nto reasons beyond his control, he has made only a minimal effort to resolve his outstanding debt. He\nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated March 17, 2006, at 1.\n1\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application) at 1, 7, 31; Tr. at 13-15.\n2\nGE 1 at 4-5; Tr. at 14-15, 24.\n3\n2\nOn July 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On August 17, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He\nrequested a hearing. \nThis matter was assigned to another administrative judge on September 12, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 21, 2007. Due to a personal emergency, DOHA reassigned\nthis case to me on October 10, 2007. I held a hearing on October 16, 2007. Five government exhibits\n(GE), 1 through 5, were marked and admitted into evidence. Applicant did not submit any documents\nat the hearing, although he testified. I held the record open until October 30, 2007 for the submission\nof additional evidence. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 24, 2007. Applicant\nsubmitted three documents, which were marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant exhibits\n(AE), A through C. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f of the\nSOR.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the\n1\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant, who is 25 years old, began working for a defense contractor two years ago. He\ncurrently works as a sheet metal mechanic. He completed his security clearance application (SF-86)\non January 31, 2006.2\nApplicant married on September 29, 2007. He and his wife have a daughter, age 2 \u00bd. He\ngraduated from high school in 2000. He attended technical college for two years. In 2003, Applicant\nmoved to his present location from another area of the country for a job. The job opportunity did not\nmaterialize as expected. He worked various jobs, with lower wages than he had previously earned\nuntil he obtained his current employment. Because of his lower income, he could not pay all his\nfinancial obligations, which resulted in unpaid debts.  \n3\n\nAE A (Budget); AE B (Leaving and earnings statements); Tr. at 16-17, 25-27.\n4\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated June 9, 2007); GE 4 (Credit report, dated May 24, 2007); GE 5 (Credit report, July\n5\n7, 2006); AE C (Payment plan); Tr. at 18-20.\nGE 3, supra note 5, at 3; Tr. at 22-23.\n6\nTr. at 28-29.\n7\n3\nApplicant received a pay raise of $1.20 an hour in September 2007. His current gross pay for\na 40 hour work week is $564.40. His earnings and leave statements from July 1, 2007 through\nOctober 14, 2007 (15 weeks) revealed that he worked overtime most pay periods and even when he\nworked less than 40 hours a week he had some overtime pay. During this period of time, his net\nincome averaged $684 a week. More recently, he has worked significantly less overtime, which\nmeans his weekly net income is significantly reduced. His wife\u2019s net income is approximately $1,100\na month. His monthly expenses, including rent, utilities, child care, food, car payment, gas, school\nloan, and miscellaneous expenses, averages approximately $2,850 a month. When he works\novertime, his income is greater than his expenses. When he does not work overtime, his family\nmonthly income pays his expenses. He has no other financial assets, except two cars, a 1996 Honda\nand 2002 Nissan.4\nThe SOR identifies six debts totaling $22,379. The majority of this debt, $18,714 relates to\ntwo unpaid education loans. Applicant pays monthly on a third education loan, which is current. He,\nhowever, has not made any payment arrangements on his outstanding education loans. Of the three\nremaining unpaid debts, he complies with the payment plan he established for the $787 debt listed\nin allegation 1.e. He contacted the collection company for the $1,363 credit card debt listed in\nallegation 1.d to work out a payment plan in late 2005 or early 2006. Initially, the creditor requested\npayment in full. When he made an offer to pay a certain amount each month, the creditor rejected\nhis offer. He has not made any additional contacts with this creditor. He has not made any payments\non the remaining debt.5\nWhen he first moved to his current location, he and two other young men leased an\napartment. One young man left the apartment fairly early, without paying his share of the rent. The\nother young man did not have employment, so Applicant attempted to pay the entire rent, but was\nonly able to pay his share of the rent. He soon vacated the premises. The landlord obtained a\njudgment against all three tenants. Applicant is attempting to obtain the money to pay the judgment\nfrom his former roommates, but has not been successful.6\nIn 2005 or 2006, Applicant contacted a consumer credit counseling agency for assistance in\nresolving his debt problems. This agency failed to provide useful assistance to him. He also\nattempted to consolidate his debt, but was told that his credit score was not high enough. He\nacknowledges that he made mistakes with managing his bills and that he acted irresponsibly towards\nhis debt, which he attributes to his immaturity. The creditors for the unpaid debts identified in\nallegations 1.c and 1.d cannot collect on these debts because the time to file a collection action in\ncourt has expired under the state\u2019s statute of limitations.

An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.8\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n9\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n10\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n11\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n12\nclearance decision.13\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n14\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n15\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n16\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\n\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n5\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n17\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individuals\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18.) Applicant has significant unpaid debt, and a\nhistory of debt problems, primarily related to his education loans. DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability \u2026 to satisfy\ndebts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nI have carefully reviewed the mitigating conditions under this guideline. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances and MC \u00b6 20 (d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts may\nhave some applicability in this case. Applicant left job security and move to a new area of the\ncountry for a promised job, which did not materialize. Although he found other employment, his\nearnings failed to provide him with sufficient income to pay his monthly bills. At the same time, he\nrented an apartment with two other young men, who failed to pay their share of the rent. Even though\nhe tried to pay the entire rent he could not. He wisely chose to move so as not to accrue any more\nunpaid rent than existed. Both of these events were not completely within his control and impacted\nhim financially. \nIn good faith and as a way to pay off his credit card debt, Applicant contacted the collection\nagency for the credit card company to work out a payment plan. The company refused his offer. The\ncompany\u2019s refusal does not negate his good faith effort. He has not contacted this company again.\nApplicant contacted a credit consolidation agency and a credit counseling company for assistance\nwith resolving his debts. Neither organization provided him with effective assistance. He has not\nmade any additional efforts to resolve his unpaid bills through these sources. Thus, Applicant\u2019s\nefforts reflect a good faith, but unsuccessful, effort to resolve his debts.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\n6\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nAs a teenager and young man, Applicant made unwise decisions about spending money,\nwhich resulted in his current debts problems. In recent years, he has not lived beyond his financial\nmeans and not accrued significant, new unpaid debts. He, however, has not taken enough initiative\nto resolve his old debts. He has made some effort, which has resulted in a payment plan for one debt.\nHis net monthly income fluctuates, depending upon how much overtime he works. In months when\nhe had higher income, he did not use this money to resolve some of his smaller debts, which would\nindicate his expressed intention to resolve his debts. Without his overtime, he lacks the resources to\nresolve his debts. \nApplicant credibly testified to the circumstances leading to his current credit problems. His\ntestimony about trying to repay his debts one at a time was sincere. He works hard and provides\nsteady  support for his family. He has many positive attributes. In weighing the positive and negative\nfactors in this case, I, however, find that Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns regarding his finances. Accordingly, I find against Applicant under Guideline F.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph e: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph f: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his foreign influence. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nOn December 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 11, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on March 3, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 14, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on April 9, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf but did not \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record \nMay 8, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nopen until April 23, 2008, to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted a fax cover \nsheet and two letters, which were marked Exhibits (AE) A through C, and received \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is Hearing Exhibit (HE) IX. The record \nclosed on April 23, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 18, \n2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nThe caption had Applicant\u2019s name reversed, with part of his first name listed as \nhis last name. On my own motion, I amended the SOR to reflect his correct first and last \nname, as listed in the caption of this decision. Department Counsel and Applicant did \nnot object to the motion.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Taiwan. Applicant did not object. The request and the \nattached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as \nHE I through VIII. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, \nbelow.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in \nTaiwan. His mother brought him and his three siblings to the U.S. when he was about \n13 years old. He has lived here ever since. He has a Bachelor of Science degree and a \nMaster of Science degree from an American university. He became a U.S. citizen in \nApril 2006. He has never been married and has no children.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is 66 years old. She moved back to Taiwan in about 2001. \nShe became a U.S. citizen several years before her move to Taiwan. She maintains \ndual citizenship with Taiwan. She is a retired college professor. His father is 70 years \nold. He is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He never moved to the U.S., but did spend \nsome extended visits and obtained permanent residence status. He was also a college \nprofessor before he retired. Applicant speaks to his parents about once or twice a \nweek.2  \n \n \nApplicant maintained dual citizenship with Taiwan after he became a U.S. citizen. \nHis parents asked him not to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. They own several \nproperties in Taiwan and intend to leave the properties to Applicant and his siblings \nafter their passing. They wanted Applicant to maintain his Taiwanese citizenship to \nensure that he could inherit the property without any problems. He kept his Taiwanese \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 21-22, 27, 36, 42; GE 1-3. \n \n2 Tr. at 22-26, 37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\npassport and used it during a trip to Taiwan in 2006. He also had a U.S. passport by \nthat time. When he realized that possession of a foreign passport could be a concern, \nhe provided the passport to his security officer who destroyed it in July 2007. He told his \nparents that he would be willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship and give up his \ninheritance if necessary.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three siblings all became U.S. citizens. Two live in the U.S. His \nyoungest brother is currently living in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). He is \nattempting to open a franchise store/restaurant that is part of a U.S. chain. None of his \nsiblings have formally renounced their Taiwanese citizenship. Applicant speaks to his \nsiblings about once a month.4 \n \n \nApplicant has about four friends that are Taiwanese citizens living in the U.S. as \npermanent residents. Several are attempting to become U.S. citizens. He has regular \nand frequent contact with them in person and on the telephone. He traveled to Taiwan \nand visited his parents in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Applicant has about \n$400,000 in real estate and other assets in the U.S.5  \n \n \nCharacter letters from Applicant\u2019s supervisors attest that he is dedicated, honest, \nresponsible, professional, and ethical, with a high level of integrity, dependability, and \nattention to detail. He is recommended for a security clearance.6 \n \nTaiwan  \n \n \nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. That \nsame year, Communists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand a separate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC does \nnot recognize Taiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d Taiwan\u2019s large military \nestablishment\u2019s primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is \nseen as the predominant threat and which has not renounced the use of force against \nTaiwan. The PRC maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan. Taiwan is known to be \nan active collector of U.S. economic intelligence. \n \n \nTaiwan is a multi-party democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work \nand sound economic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an \nunderdeveloped, agricultural island to an economic power that is a leading producer of \nhigh-technology goods. On January 1, 1979, the United States formally recognized the \nPRC as the sole legal government of China. The U.S. also announced that it would \nmaintain cultural, commercial, and other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. \nThe Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) signed into law on April 10, 1979, created the legal \nauthority for the conduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. The American Institute in \nTaiwan, a private nonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is authorized to issue \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 26-33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n4 Tr. at 33-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3. \n \n5 Tr. at 37-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n6 AE B, C. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nvisas, accept passport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in Taiwan. A \ncounterpart organization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the U.S. \n \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. \ndoes not support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in \nappropriate international organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nwhich it joined in 2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the \nAsian Development Bank. In addition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for \nTaiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in organizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to help Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to \nTaiwan, in accordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the \nUnited States would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a \nsubstantial sale of U.S. weapons to Taiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine \naircraft, and diesel submarines. The White House also was more accommodating to \nvisits from Taiwan\u2019s officials than previous U.S. Administrations, and permitted visits \nfrom Taiwan\u2019s president in 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s vice president and defense \nminister in 2002. \n \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new \npresident disavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party - the \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it - and instead has adopted the \nmore provocative position that Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \n\u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to maintain. There was also a series of recent corruption \nscandals. \n \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to \nhave dialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still \npursuing a close relationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing \ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and \nwarnings to the effect that U.S. support for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n (i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make \nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign \nperson, group, government, or country.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Taiwan, a country known to be an \nactive collector of U.S. economic intelligence. His mother is a dual U.S.-Taiwan citizen \nliving in Taiwan. His three siblings are all dual citizens. Applicant\u2019s foreign connections \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. They also create a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \n \nI do not find that Applicant\u2019s friendship with Taiwanese citizens who are U.S. \npermanent residents is sufficient to raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.d is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s periodic trips to Taiwan \nmade him vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country. While the trips are relevant evidence for other considerations, \nthey do not raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.e is concluded for Applicant.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n\n \n7 \n \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant has lived in this country since he was 13 years old, when his mother \nbrought him and his three siblings here. He became a U.S. citizen in April 2006. His \nmother and three siblings also became U.S. citizens. His father never moved to the U.S. \nand his mother moved back to Taiwan in about 2001. Applicant maintained dual \ncitizenship with Taiwan at his parents\u2019 request so that he and his siblings could inherit \ntheir property without any problems. While he destroyed his Taiwanese passport and \nstated he is willing to forsake his inheritance and Taiwanese citizenship, he has not \nbeen a U.S. citizen unencumbered by direct ties to Taiwan for long enough to fully \nsatisfy any mitigating condition.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan. Taiwan is an ally of \nthe United States. However, it is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic \nintelligence and Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe \nUnited States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified [or \nsensitive] information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d7 The distinctions between friendly and \nunfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can \nshift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly.  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the U.S. \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen about two years ago. He maintained his \nTaiwanese citizenship at his parents\u2019 request to ensure his inheritance would pass to \nhim without incident. He used his Taiwanese passport during a trip to Taiwan in 2006, \nafter he became a U.S. citizen. When he realized the passport was a concern, he had it \ndestroyed. He stated that he is willing to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship and give \nup his inheritance if necessary. His two siblings live in the U.S. He has a good job \nwhere he is a valued and trusted engineer. He has extensive U.S. assets valued at \nabout $400,000. Applicant carries the burden of persuasion in this case. When I \nbalance all the evidence, I find that Applicant has not been a fully committed U.S. citizen \nlong enough to counter the concerns raised by his foreign ties and connections.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 24, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under SOR \u00b6 1(g) is not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were supported by substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law   Finding no harmful error, we affirm.  \n1\nThe Judge made the following sustainable findings of fact: Applicant is a service systems\nengineer for a Defense contractor.  He was born and raised in Iran, immigrating to the U.S. in the\n1970s.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in the mid 1990s.  He obtained a U.S. passport but\nretained his Iranian passport, using it upon one occasion.  He has since surrendered his Iranian\npassport to his employer.  He has never worked for the Iranian government in any capacity.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born and raised in Iran.  She too immigrated to the U.S. and became\na naturalized citizen in the mid 1990s.  Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran.\nApplicant talks with his mother by telephone every couple of months.  Applicant\u2019s siblings are also\ncitizens and residents of Iran.  He maintains telephone contact with one of the siblings every six\nmonths and with the other three monthly.  Most of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family members are citizens\nand residents of Iran, including her parents.  \nIran is a country that sponsors terrorism and practices human rights violations.  It is engaged\nin an effort to obtain and/or develop weapons of mass destruction and it supports violent opposition\nto the Middle East process.   Arbitrary arrest and detention are standard practices.  The Iranian\ngovernment treats U.S.-Iranian dual nationals as Iranian citizens.  U.S. nationals who enter Iran only\non a U.S. passport risk detention absent persuasive proof of their formal renunciation of Iranian\ncitizenship.  Applicant \u201ccould conceivably obtain an Iranian passport in the future [although] he has\nno intention of doing so.  He has never made any attempt to renounce his Iranian citizenship.\u201d\nDecision at 3.  Applicant has no plans to return to Iran.  Id. at 4.  He has selected a third country in\nwhich to meet with family members.\nThe Board has considered the Judge\u2019s findings in light of the record as a whole.  The Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings of security concern are supported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d) Applicant\ntakes issue with certain of the Judge\u2019s statements.  For example, the Judge found that \u201cIran\u2019s post-\nrevolution has been marked by an eight-year war with Iran . . .\u201d  Decision at 5 (emphasis added).\nThis statement appears to refer to Iran\u2019s war with Iraq, the challenged use of \u201cIran\u201d merely\nconstituting a typographical error.  See, e. g., Administrative Notice Document I, U.S. Department\nof State Background Note: Iran, at 7.   Applicant also draws the Board\u2019s attention to two references\nin the Analysis section of the decision to Sudan.  One describes \u201cApplicant\u2019s assurances of reporting\nhis travel plans to Sudan and his long absence from the country . . .\u201d  Id. at 11.  The other concerns\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cfamilial relationships in the Sudan.\u201d  Id. at 12.  These references are clearly erroneous,\ninsofar as the security concerns in this case arise from Applicants\u2019 contacts with Iran.  There is\nnothing in the record to connect him with Sudan.   However, reading them in the context of the entire\ndecision and the Judge\u2019s detailed findings of fact about Iran, these references, although erroneous,\nare without consequence.  The decision as a whole does not support a conclusion that the Judge\n\nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.6: \u201cAdjudication under [Guideline B] can and should consider the identity of the foreign\n2\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located . . .\u201d  \nactually evaluated Applicant\u2019s case in light of the wrong country.   The Board concludes that these\n2\nerrors are harmless in that, had they not occurred, the Judge would still have decided the case in the\nsame way.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 06-19544 at 4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2008); ISCR Case No.\n0706332 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). \nConcerning the remaining issue, the Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the\nrecord as a whole.  The Judge has drawn a rational connection between the facts found and his\nultimate adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun.\n2, 2006).  See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly consistent with national interest to grant or\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.  Decision at 12.  See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 22, 2008, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on June 14, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on July 15,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 15, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and three exhibits.  The transcript\nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\n(R.T.) was received on July 23, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is denied.\nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of 12\ndocuments:  Background Note: Iran, U.S. Department of State (March 2008); Country\nSpecific Information, Iran, U.S. Department of State (June 2007) U.S. Department of\nState (August 2007); Travel Warning, Iran, U.S. Department of State (January 2008);\nCRS Response for Congress, Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses, U.S.\nDepartment of State (January 2008);  Country Reports on Human Rights Practices -\n2007, Iran, U.S. Department of State  (March 2008); Country Reports on Terrorism 2007,\nChapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, U.S. Department of State (November\n2007); Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism\nOverview, U.S. Department of State (April 2008); The National Security Strategy of the\nUnited States of America, President of the United States (March 2006); The Iranian\nRegime: A Challenge to the World, U.S. Department of State (May 2006); Making\nAmerica Safer by Defeating Extremists in the Middle East, Statement by President of the\nUnited States  (August 2007); President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address\n(January 2008); President Bush\u2019s Message to the Congress of the United States (March\n2008);  Annual Threat Assessment for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence\n(February 2008). \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 02-24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for\nnoticing facts or government reports that are well known.   See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Iran.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent  with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did  not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Iran\u2019s current state.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have immediate family members\n(his spouse, mother, brother and three sisters who are citizens and residents of Iran, (b)\nhave a father-in-law and mother-in-law who are citizens and residents of Iran, (c) have\ntraveled to Iran in 2001, and (d) traveled to the UAE in 2004 to visit family.  For his\nanswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old service systems engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in Iran and attended private schools there.  He\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1978 at the age of 18 on a student visa to attend an accredited\nuniversity and pursue and engineering curriculum (R.T., at 35-36, 39-40).  \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1996 (see ex. 1), and\nrenewed his Iranian passport in February 1996 (see ex. 5).  When he became a U.S.\ncitizen, and obtained his U.S. passport, he retained his Iranian passport for a number of\nyears and used it on one occasion when he traveled to Iran (R.T., at 42, 79). He only\nrecently (in March 2008) surrendered his Iranian passport to his employer (see ex. 4;\nR.T., at 36-37), and still does not know how the Iranian government treats his dual\ncitizen status (R.T., at 42).   While he could conceivably obtain an Iranian passport in the\nfuture, he has no intention of doing so (R.T., at 42-43).  Still, he has never made any\nattempt to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  He has never served in the Iranian military,\nhas no willingness to do so now, and immigrated to the U.S. to avoid military service in\nIran\u2019s military forces (R.T., at 43).   Applicant has had nothing to do with the Iranian\ngovernment since immigrating to this country and has never worked for the Iranian\ngovernment in any capacity (R.T., at 44-45).\nApplicant met his wife (W) while attending college in the U.S. Like, Applicant, she\nwas born and raised in Iran and immigrated to the U.S. after high school to attend\ncollege.(R.T., at 49).  She joined Applicant in becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in\nSeptember 1996 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 47).  Applicant and his spouse were married in June\n1979.  They have two children: a daughter (age 25) who attends law school and a son\n(age 17) who will be senior in high school (see ex. 1; R.T., at 51-52).  \nApplicant\u2019s father, an Iranian citizen by birth, is deceased (ex. 1). During his\nlifetime, he neither served in the Iranian military or worked in the Iranian government\n(R.T., at 46-47, 53).  His mother is a citizen and resident of Iran (see exs. 1 and 2; R.T.,\nat 53-54).  She is 79 years of age and has never worked for the Iranian government (see\nex. 2; R.T., at 54).  She has no pension or health insurance from the Iranian government.\nShe is self sufficient through his father\u2019s savings insurance and receives no financial\nsupport from Applicant (R.T., at 54, 57).  Applicant talks with his mother by telephone\nevery  couple of months (R.T., at 56).  \nBoth Applicant\u2019s brother and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iran.  His\nbrother (two years younger than Applicant) works for a major university in Iran, which\nmay or may not be affiliated with the Iranian government (R.T., at 59-60).  His brother\nhas worked for this university for most of his adult life.  He served for two years in the\nIranian military, which is mandatory for all male Iranian citizens (R.T., at 61).  Applicant\ndoes not know whether his brother has a military pension or not (R.T., at 62).  And to the\nbest of his knowledge, his brother has had no other affiliations with the Iranian\ngovernment (R.T., at 63). He makes telephone contact with his brother every six months\n(R.T., at 63).  His brother has two children who reside in Iran and attend college there\n(R.T.,at 64).\n\n4\nBesides his brother, Applicant has three sisters who are citizens and residents of\nIran.  The oldest previously worked for a bank and has not been in the work force for\nover 20 years (R.T., at 65).  Her husband owns a private appliance store (R.T., at 66).\nApplicant\u2019s next oldest sister was a school teacher at a private school before she retired\nseveral years ago (R.T., at 66).  She has a private pension from the same school.  Her\nhusband is an agricultural engineer, and they have two children; one resides abroad,\nwhile the youngest lives at home and attends an Iranian college (R.T., at 67).\nApplicant\u2019s youngest sister is also a retired school teacher (R.T., at 69).  Her husband\ncontinues to teach school.  They have three children: the oldest is an engineer for a\nprivate firm, and the youngest attends college (R.T., at 69-70).  Applicant talks with his\nand sisters monthly by telephone (see ex. 2).\nMost of W\u2019s family members are also citizens and residents of Iran (R.T., at 71-\n74).  They visit the U.S. every five to six years to see Applicant and W, and typically\nspend two to three months with Applicant and his family. W\u2019s father owns a private\nbusiness in Iran, and has neither served in the Iranian military nor worked for the Iranian\ngovernment (R.T., at 72).  Her mother is a housewife and has had no involvement with\nthe Iranian government (R.T., at 72).  W\u2019s brothers (two in all) and sisters (three in\nnumber) are Iranian citizens by birth and reside in Iran.  Each of his sisters is a\nhousewife, and has no involvement in the Iranian government.  One brother sells\nappliances and has no involvement with the Iranian government (R.T., at 73).  The other\nbrother currently resides in India while attending college (R.T., at 73-74).  Applicant has\nno relatives affiliated with the Iranian military or government that he is aware of.  \nApplicant has no assets in Iran, no expectation of any inheritance from his family,\nand no known obligations to any Iranian citizens/residents (ex. 2; R.T., at 75).  W\u2019s family\nmembers own apartment units in Iran, but W has no interest in any of these units.\nApplicant\u2019s home in the U.S. has been appraised at $365,000.00.   When he last traveled\nto Iran in 2001 to visit his family, he used his Iranian passport, but always showed his\nU.S. passport as well (R.T., at 77-80).  Iranian officials wanted to know here he was\ngoing (R.T., at 77-79). Frustrated with the Iranian government\u2019s internal and foreign\npolicies, he has no plans to return to the country (R.T., at 38).  In 2004, he picked the\nUAE as a venue to see his mother and sister, and used his U.S. passport to enter and\nexit the country (R.T., at 80-81).  While he strongly opposes the current Iranian regime,\nhe has no reason to believe that any of his family members are at any risk to pressure,\nduress or coercion from Iranian military and intelligence officials (see ex. 2; R.T., at 81-\n82).   He provides no details, though, as to why he believes his family is not at risk.\nPolitical and economic background of Iran\nAccording to official U.S. State Department documents, Iran is an Islamic republic\nthat is constitutionally constructed and has a head of state, an elected president and\ncounsel of ministers, a legislative body composed of a 290-member Islamic consultative\nassembly, and a judiciary (see U.S. Dept. of State Background Note on Iran, supra, at 5).\nThroughout its long history, Iran has been ruled by numerous dynasties.  Following a\nnationalist uprising against the Shah in 1905, Iran enacted a limited constitution in 1906.\n\n5\nTwo years later, oil was discovered, and Iran began its steady ascension  to a modern,\nsecularized political system.  Under the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi (an Iranian officer,\nwho seized control of the government in 1921), Iran enacted policies of modernization\nand secularization, established a central government and reasserted its authority over\nthe tribes and provinces (see U.S. Dept. of State Background Note on Iran, id., at 3).\nDuring the Allied occupation of western Iran in 1941, the Shah was forced to abdicate\nand was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (see U.S. Dept. of State\nBackground Note on Iran, id.).\nDomestic turmoil swept Iran in 1978 as the result of heated religious and political\nopposition to the Shah\u2019s rule and political/economic programs (especially the Shah\u2019s\ninternal security and intelligence service).  And in February 1979, exiled religious leader\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini returned from France to direct a revolution resulting in a\nnew, theocratic republic guided by Islamic principles.  Iran\u2019s 1979 constitution allocates\nthe duties of the chosen religious leaders and governing bodies in such a way that their\nduties often overlap.  Legislative issues on which the Majles (Iran\u2019s legislative governing\nbody) and the Council of Guardians (making up Iran\u2019s religious leadership) fail to agree\nare resolved by the Council of Expediency (a body created by Ayatollah Khomeini in\n1988).  Following the Ayatollah\u2019s death in June 1989, the Assembly of Experts (an\nelected body of senior clerics) chose the outgoing president of the republic (Ali\nKhamenei) to be the Ayatollah\u2019s successor as national religious leader (see U.S. Dept. of\nState Background Note on Iran, id., at 4).\nIran\u2019s post-revolution has been marked by an eight-year war with Iran, internal\npolitical struggles and unrest, and economic disorder.  Its post-revolution regime has\nbeen associated with human rights violations and political turmoil, including the seizure\nof the U.S. Embassy in November 1979 by Iranian militants and the hostage taking of 52\nAmericans (see CRS Response for Congress, Iran: U.S. Concerns and Policy\nResponses, U.S. Department of State (January 2008, supra, at 2).  Succeeding power\nstruggles have severely eroded the center and left of Iran\u2019s political institutions, leaving\nonly the clergy.  Both human rights and state sponsored terrorism remain serious\nproblems in Iran and the Middle East.  According to State Department reports,  Iran\u2019s\nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Ministry of Intelligence and Security Forces have\nbeen directly involved in terrorist acts, and continue to support Palestinian groups with\nleadership cadres in Syria and Lebanese Hizballah to use terrorism in pursuit of their\ngoals (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2007, Chapter 3 - State\nSponsors of Terrorism Overview, supra, at 1-5; Country Reports on terrorism 2008,\nChapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, supra, at 1-2).  State Department\nrepots claim Iranian authorities continue to provide military support and guidance to\nsome Iraqi militant groups that target Coalition and Iraqi security forces and Iraqi civilians\n(see Country Reports on terrorism 2008, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism\nOverview, id.).\n Long estranged from the West, Khomeini\u2019s regime charted regional goals that\ncurtail the presence of the U.S. and other outside powers in the region.  Iran\u2019s Islamic\nforeign policy continues to stress (1) vehement anti-U.S. and ant-Israel positions, (2)\n\n6\nelimination of outside influence in the region, (3) support for Muslim political movements\nabroad, (4) critical support to non-state terrorist groups, and (5) considerable increase in\ndiplomatic contacts with developing countries (see U.S. Dept. of State Background Note\non Iran, supra; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Chapter 3 - State\nSponsors of Terrorism Overview, supra; Country Reports on Terrorism 2007, Chapter 3 -\nState Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, supra).  In this vein, Iran maintains regular\ndiplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and the former Soviet republics.  Of\nspecial U.S. concern has been Russian sales of military equipment and technology to\nIran (see  U.S. Dept. of State Background Note on Iran, id., at 8).\nPotential obstacles to improved relations between Iran and the U.S. include\nIranian efforts to acquire technology that could be used to develop nuclear weapons and\nother weapons of mass destruction; its support for and involvement in international\nterrorism; its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\ndismal human rights record (see The National Security Strategy of the United States of\nAmerica, President of the United States (March 2006), supra; The Iranian Regime: A\nChallenge to the World, U.S. Department of State (May 2006); Making America Safer by\nDefeating Extremists in the Middle East, Statement by President of the United States\n(August 2007); President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address (January 2008);\nPresident Bush\u2019s Message to the Congress of the United States (March 2008);  Annual\nThreat Assessment for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (February 2008)).\nState Department country reports cite significant restrictions on the right of\ncitizens to change their government, summary executions (minors included),\ndisappearances, torture and severe punishments (such as amputations and flogging),\nviolence by vigilante groups with ties to the government, poor prison conditions, arbitrary\narrest and detention (including prolonged solitary confinement), lack of judicial\nindependence and fair public trials, political prisoners and detainees, excessive\ngovernment violence in Kurdish areas and unknown groups in Arab regions of the\ncountry, severe restrictions on civil liberties and freedom of religion, official corruption,\ngovernment transparency deficiencies, legal and societal discrimination against women,\nethnic and religious minorities, trafficking in persons, incitement of anti-Semitism, severe\nrestriction of workers\u2019 rights, and child labor (see Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices-2007, Iran, supra). \nAddressing reports of human rights violations in Iran, the UN General Assembly\nadopted a human rights resolution on Iran in December 2005 that expressed serious\nconcern at the continuing use of torture in Iran and cruel, trafficking in persons, inhuman\nand degrading treatment or punishment, such as floggings and amputations, as well as\npublic executions (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Iran, id., at 3-\n24). \nEven though Iran\u2019s constitution prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, these\npractices remain common. Its regular and paramilitary security forces that share\nresponsibility with Iranian police for law enforcement and maintaining order are reported\nto have committed numerous, serious human rights abuses in recent years (see Country\n\n7\nReports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Iran, id.). Security forces responsible for\narrest and detention often do not inform family members of a prisoner\u2019s welfare and\nlocations, and often deny visits by family members and counsel.\nState Department travel warnings urge U.S. citizens to carefully consider the risks\nof travel to Iran (see U.S. State Department Travel Warning, Iran, 2008, supra), a\ncountry with which the U.S. does not currently have diplomatic or consular relations.\nCiting Iran\u2019s non-recognition of dual citizenship and general declination to permit the\nSwiss to provide protective services for U.S. citizens who are also Iranian nationals,\nAmericans who travel to Iran are strongly encouraged to register through the State\nDepartment\u2019s travel registration website (see U.S. State Department Travel Warning,\nIran, 2008, id.).\nDual citizens residing or visiting in Iran are subject to all Iranian laws affecting\nU.S. citizens, as well as laws applicable to persons of Iranian nationality that impose\nspecial obligations on citizens of that country (see U.S. State Department Travel\nWarning, Iran, 2008, id.; Country Specific Information, Iran, 2007, supra).  Dual nationals\nremain subject to Iran\u2019s military service requirements and can be conscripted into service\nwhile on Iranian soil. While such conscripted service seems unlikely to confront\nApplicant, given his age and longstanding U.S. citizenship, it remains a possibility.\nReports indicate, too, that Iranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors\nunder surveillance, and even arrest or detain Iranian-Americans suspected of \u201cacting\nagainst national security\u201d  (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, Iran,\nsupra, at 5-6; Country Specific Information, Iran, 2007,  id., at 2-3). \n Because the Iranian government does not recognize dual nationality and will treat\nU.S.-Iranian dual nationals as Iranian citizens, regardless of there U.S. naturalization\nstatus, dual nationals who enter Iran only on a U.S. passport risk detention absent\npersuasive proof of their formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship (see Country\nSpecific Information, Iran, 2007,  id. at 1).  Because Applicant himself does not know\nhow the Iranian authorities might consider his Iranian citizen status, he cannot be\nabsolved of detention risk should he choose to travel to Iran on his U.S. passport.  \nCharacter assessments\nApplicant has received excellent endorsements from program managers and\nother colleagues who have worked with him worked with him closely and attest to his\ngood character.  Their assessments of Applicant reflect positively on his judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness (see ex. A).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\n\n8\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in\nU.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest.  Adjudication under the this Guideline can and\nshould considered the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is\nknown to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism\u201d (see\nAdjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\n\n9\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nBorn and raised in Iran, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996.  He\nmet his wife (a dual citizen with Iran) in 1996, and married her in 1999.  Security\nconcerns principally focus on Applicant\u2019s immediate and extended family members who\nare Iranian citizens residing in Iran.  Applicant and his wife and family have deep roots in\nIran, a country historically known to practice terrorism, and to exercise repression and\nhuman rights abuses against its own citizens, as well as dual citizens who visit the\ncountry.\nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s mother and\nsiblings on his side of the family who are citizens of Iran and reside there, as well as his\nwife\u2019s family members who are citizens and residents of Iran, might be subject to undue\nforeign influence by Iranian government authorities to access classified information in\nApplicant\u2019s possession or control.  \nBy virtue of the Iranian citizenship and residency of the family members of both\nApplicant and his wife, they present potential heightened security risks covered by\ndisqualifying condition  (DC) 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence.\nThe citizenship/residence status of these family members in Iran pose potential concerns\nfor Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise\nsensitive or classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. \nBecause none of Applicant\u2019s family or W\u2019s family have any identified Iranian prior\nmilitary or government service, no consideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between\nthe individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation,\u201d is warranted.  To be sure, from what is known from the presented evidence,\nnone of W\u2019s immediate family residing in Iran have any political affiliations with the\nIranian government or military, have any history to date of being subjected to any\ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \n\n10\nStill, upon fully considering Applicant\u2019s explanations about his immediate and\nextended family members residing in Iran, and his wife\u2019s dual Iranian citizenship and\ndeep family roots in Iran (which include all of her siblings who still reside there), risks of\nundue foreign influence on Applicant, his own siblings, his wife and her family members\nresiding in Iran, cannot be safely discounted. Applicant/W\u2019s contacts with their family\nmembers appear to be substantial and ongoing, and clearly of the magnitude that could\nmake them subject to a heightened security risk of pressure or compromise under\nGuideline B.\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines covering risks of\nforeign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel\nsecurity assessments continue to be governed by the same Change 4 requirements of\nthe Directive for appraising the security risks associated with the individual's having\nfamily abroad, which include both common sense assessments of country risks and\ninformation available from public sources.\nUnlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, though, the new ones do take into account\nthe country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in\ngauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create\na heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign\nregime involved do matter. \nAs demonstrated, Iran has long been known to be a repressive country, who has\ncommitted numerous, serious human rights abuses in recent years, and shown little\nrespect for the rule of law.  The U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Iran.  Iran remains\na country on the State Department \u2018s state terrorist list, and one with a known history of\nhostage taking and human rights abuses of wide magnitude and scope. Iran is\nconsistently characterized as a country historically hostile to American political and\nsecurity interests since the 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran and ensuing establishment of an\nIslamic republic with close ties and support to non-state terrorist groups.  Based on\nreported terrorist activities in the country and in other countries in the region with support\nlinks to Iran, Iran cannot be deemed to provide an acceptable political and security\nenvironment for managing hostage risks.  Without such assurances, no reasonable\nconclusions can be reached that Applicant\u2019s immediate and extended family members\nare not in a position to be exploited by Iranian authorities.\n Based on his case-specific circumstances, MC 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is not available to Applicant.  Neither Applicant nor his wife and their respective\n\n11\nfamily members residing in Iran can be characterized as sufficiently insulated from\npotential pressures and influence from the Iranian government and military officials to\nwarrant application of this mitigating condition.  Of some benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b),\n\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the\nU.S., while considerable, are not enough to neutralize all potential conflicts that are\nimplicit in his relationships with his spouse, his siblings, and his wife\u2019s family members.\nMC 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has\nsome applicability, too, based on Applicant own infrequent contacts with his wife\u2019s family\nmembers residing in Iran.  Application of MC 8(c) is necessarily limited, though, because\nof the frequent exchanges applicant and W maintain with their family members residing\nin Iran.\nTwo other mitigating conditions have mixed application to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nMC 8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country,\u201d has some prospective value based on Applicant\u2019s\nassurances of reporting his travel plans to Sudan, and his long absence from the country\n(no visits since 1996).  But there is really no documented record of Applicant\u2019s prior\nreporting of his contacts with members of his family and his wife\u2019s family, respectively, to\nwarrant any more than minimal consideration at this time.  The same holds true with\nrespect to MC 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d  The extent of\nApplicant\u2019s and W\u2019s financial interests and expectancies (e.g., inheritance) in Iran is not\nfully known at this time.  \nGiven that Iran remains a hostile country with no diplomatic relations with the\nU.S., and one that lacks a secure infrastructure and track record for respecting human\nrights and the rule of law, the risk of a pressure or influence situation involving an\nimmediate or extended family member of Applicant\u2019s cannot be safely discounted.  Iran\u2019s\nstrategic location and political character, when coupled with Applicant\u2019s own\ndemonstrated preference for the country, conduce to create security concerns over risks\nof direct or indirect pressure or influence of an immediate or extended family member of\nApplicant\u2019s by Iranian authorities.  These concerns are not sufficiently mitigated to permit\nsafe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of exploitation and\npressure attributable to his familial relationships and contacts with his immediate and\nextended family members domiciled  in Iran.\n\n12\nWhole person assessment is not available either to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure\nto conflict of interests with his Iranian family members.  While Applicant is not aware of\nany risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his, or his wife\u2019s, family members\nmight be exposed to, the potential risk of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought\nto bear on him, his wife, or any of their respective family members remains uncertain,\nand therefore potentially considerable. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's relations with\nhis wife and their respective family members residing in Iran are insufficiently mitigated\nto permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue\ninfluence attributable to his familial relationships in the Sudan.  Unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.f of\nGuideline B.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.g due to\nthe relative lack of any hostile threat posed by Applicant\u2019s travels to the UAE to visit his\nfamily.\nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2.2.2 of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

He was also required by Air Force regulation to attend alcohol counseling classes. He started those classes in Korea but 3 changed duty stations back to the United States before completing the classes. He was told not to consume alcohol because of his duty as an air traffic controller. He participated in some alcohol counseling and abstained from alcohol consumption for about a month in Korea after the offense before he resumed the consumption of alcohol (Tr. 24-26). After his change of station to an Air Force base in the United States in early 2000, Applicant completed alcohol evaluation and counseling and it was determined that he was an alcohol abuser.

DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 4, \n2008.  The government offered seven exhibits, marked Gov. Ex. 1-7, which were \nreceived without objection.  Applicant submitted 11 exhibits, marked App. Ex. A-K, \nwhich were received without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 15, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant testified in response to questions by Department Counsel that he was \ncharged with driving while intoxicated in April or May 2008.  He was found guilty of the \noffense on August 19, 2008, and was fined, ordered to complete an alcohol education \nclass, and his driver's license was suspended (Tr. 50-55). Based on this information, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add the following allegation under \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \n \n\"In about May 2008, you were charged with driving while under the \ninfluence in [City and State].  On or about August 19, 2008, you were \nfound guilty as charged.  You were sentenced to a fine of $800, ordered to \ncomplete 12 hours of alcohol education classes, and your license was \nsuspended for approximately seven months.\" \n \nApplicant had no objection to the request and the motion was granted amending the \nSOR to add subparagraph c to Paragraph 1 under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, \nas stated above. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and has been an air traffic control specialist and test \nengineer for a defense contractor for two years.  This position does not require him to \nbe alcohol free since he is not directly controlling aircraft.  He previously served over 20 \nyears on active duty with the Air Force as an air traffic controller (Tr. 22-23, 57-58; Gov. \nEx. 1, e-QIP, dated June 27, 2006).  He received an honorable discharge on April 30, \n2005 (Gov. Ex. 7, DD form 214, dated April 30, 2005). \n \nOn August 12, 1999, while stationed in Korea as an air traffic controller, Applicant \nreceived non-judicial punishment for driving while intoxicated.  He was reduced one \ngrade, and restricted to the installation (Tr. 22-23; Gov. Ex. 6, Record of non-judicial \npunishment proceedings, dated August 18, 1999).  He was also required by Air Force \nregulation to attend alcohol counseling classes.  He started those classes in Korea but \n\n \n3 \n \n \nchanged duty stations back to the United States before completing the classes.  He was \ntold not to consume alcohol because of his duty as an air traffic controller.  He \nparticipated in some alcohol counseling and abstained from alcohol consumption for \nabout a month in Korea after the offense before he resumed the consumption of alcohol \n(Tr. 24-26).   \n \nAfter his change of station to an Air Force base in the United States in early \n2000, Applicant completed alcohol evaluation and counseling and it was determined \nthat he was an alcohol abuser.  He was ordered not to drink alcohol because of his \nduties in air traffic control.  His command requested a waiver of the prohibition for him to \nwork in air traffic control because of the alcohol abuse diagnosis.  The waiver was \ngranted.  Applicant was not to consume any alcohol if he wanted to continue in his \ncareer field of air traffic control.  Applicant did not consume alcohol for about six \nmonths, but then started to again consume alcohol.  He did not inform his commander \nthat he was drinking alcohol.  In 2004, a subordinate informed Applicant's commander \nthat Applicant was harassing subordinates and drinking alcohol.  The commander \ninvestigated and determined there was no harassment but Applicant admitted to the \ncommander that he was drinking alcohol.  He was removed from the duty of direct \ncontact and control of aircraft and assigned to administrative functions until he retired in \nearly 2005.  While assigned to administrative duties, Applicant continued to drink \nalcohol.  He was not required to refrain from alcohol consumption because he was no \nlonger assigned to the duty of controlling aircraft (Tr. 19-36; Gov. Ex. 3, Interrogatories, \ndated March 2, 2007). \n \nApplicant denied that he consumes alcohol on a daily basis (SOR allegation 1.a).  \nHe did admit that he consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication about two or three \ntimes a week (Tr. 16-17).  Applicant denies that he is an alcoholic or that he has a \nproblem with alcohol consumption.  He has never been advised to stop drinking alcohol \n(Tr. 55-56). \n \nApplicant admitted that he last consumed alcohol the week-end (August 30, \n2008) before the hearing when he attended a wedding.  He admitted to consuming six \nor seven drinks of whiskey and was intoxicated.  He admitted he also drank to the point \nof intoxication the week-end before the wedding.  He admitted to drinking to the point of \nintoxication at least once a week.  It usually takes him three or five drinks to be \nintoxicated (Tr. 48-50). \n \nApplicant revealed that he was arrested about four months before the hearing for \ndriving under the influence of alcohol.  He had consumed about four drinks of whiskey \nat a bar after work before starting to drive home.  He was stopped by police for failing to \nmaintain a driving lane and given a field sobriety test that showed his blood alcohol to \nbe a .25.  Even though he contested the accuracy of the breathalyzer, he was found \nguilty on August 19, 2008, and sentenced to an $800 fine, to attend a 12 hour alcohol \nawareness program, and his license was suspended for seven months (Tr. 50-55). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant and his wife argued on the afternoon of August 13, 2005.  He had \nconsumed alcohol the night before but had not been drinking the day of the argument.  \nThe couple pushed and shoved each other and Applicant admitted to pushing his wife \nto the ground twice.  The police arrested Applicant for simple assault.  He pled guilty to \nthe offense and was sentenced to a fine of $564 and ordered to attend an anger \nmanagement program.  Applicant and his wife were both arrested in October 2006 for \narguing and assaulting each other.  The charges were dismissed in court (Tr. 36-40; \nGov. Ex. 4, Interrogatories, dated March 2, 2007; Gov. Ex. 5, Criminal justice report, \nundated). \n \nAs a result of the August 2005 incident, Applicant was required to attend an \nanger management course.  Applicant anticipated receiving a civilian air traffic control \nposition in the Middle East.  Applicant, on his and his attorney's request, received \npermission to find their own anger management course rather than one run by the local \ncourt authorities.  Applicant attended only two or three session of this anger \nmanagement course before he stopped attending.  He stated that he believed the \nmatter of his need for the course was resolved and he did not have to attend any more \nclasses because his attorney said he would send a letter to the court stating that he was \nattending the course.  He knew he was ordered to complete the course and knew he \nhad not completed the course but thought the matter had been resolved by his attorney. \nHe did not discuss the matter with his attorney before deciding not to complete the \ncourse.   \n \nApplicant was questioned by security investigators concerning his attendance \nand completion of the anger management course.  He informed the investigators that he \nhad completed the course.  He testified at the hearing that he did not complete the \ncourse but thought the matter had been resolved by his attorney.  He made a conscious \ndecision not to continue to attend the course.  His attorney determined that Applicant \nhad attended some sessions but did not complete the program.  Applicant tried to make \narrangements to complete the program.  No arrangements were made because his \noriginal doctor is not taking new patients and he cannot find another doctor that \nconducts an anger management course.  He has not made inquiries on available \ncourses in months (Tr. 40-43, 60-63; Gov. Ex. 4, Attorney's letter, dated August 16, \n2007). \n \nApplicant presented his evaluation reports for his entire Air Force career.  These \nevaluations show that Applicant was regarded as one of the best air traffic controllers in \nthe Air Force.  His performance of duty was excellent and he was considered to be the \n\"go to person\" for air traffic control issues and problems.  Even though he was reduced \nin grade as a result of the non-judicial punishment, he was promoted again to the grade \nof master sergeant (E-7) before he retired (App. Ex. K, Evaluation Reports, 1984-2004).   \n \nA former supervisor and colleague stated that Applicant worked directly for him \non numerous occasions.  He considered Applicant to be his most trusted and competent \nworker and could count on him to do the job correctly.  His integrity is beyond reproach \nand he could trust his word and judgment (App. Ex. A, Letter, dated August 15, 2008). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnother former colleague and supervisor, who knew Applicant for his entire Air \nForce career, stated the Applicant is a straight forward and honest individual.  He has \nno doubt Applicant can be trusted with a security clearance and access to classified \ninformation (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated August 11, 2008). \n \nAnother former colleague and supervisor stated that he has known Applicant for \nover eight years while he was in the Air Force.  Applicant did an excellent job as an air \ntraffic controller.  He knows of Applicant's alcohol related incident in Korea since \nApplicant worked for him at the time.  Applicant was honest about the incident and his \nconduct and took responsibility for his actions.  He recommended Applicant for his \npresent civilian position.  Applicant's best qualities are his honesty and truthfulness \n(App. Ex. C, Letter, dated August 26, 2008). \n \nApplicant received the Meritorious Service Medal with First Oak Leaf Cluster \n(App. Ex. D, citation, dated January 4, 2005; App. Ex. E, Citation October 15, 1998).  \nApplicant received the Air Force Commendation Medal and four Oak Leaf Clusters for \nhis service in Air Traffic Control (App. Ex. F-I, Citations, Various dates).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s non-judicial punishment for driving while intoxicated, his recent arrest \nand conviction for driving while intoxicated, as well as his continued drinking to excess \nto the point of intoxication at least once a week raise Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying \nConditions (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as \ndriving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC DC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  The driving while \nintoxicated incidents are alcohol-related incidents away from work.  His drinking to \nexcess at least once a week is an indication of binge or habitual consumption of alcohol.  \n \n \nThe SOR allegation states that Applicant generally consumed alcohol daily, that \nhe drinks to the point of intoxication one or two times per week, and he has no intention \nto change his behavior.  Applicant denies that he consumes alcohol almost daily, but \nadmits that he consumes alcohol once or twice a week to the point of intoxication, and \ndoes not intend to change his alcohol-related behavior.  There is no indication Applicant \ndrinks alcohol every day, but there is ample evidence to establish that he drinks alcohol \nto the point of intoxication once or twice a week, and that he does not intend to change \nhis behavior.  Applicant drank to the point of intoxication the week-end before the \nhearing and the week-end before that.  He had a recent arrest and conviction for driving \nwhile intoxicated.  This shows he has no intention of changing his drinking habits and \nbehavior. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant testified that while in the Air Force he was evaluated and determined to \nbe an alcohol abuser.  There is no indication of the qualification or status of the \nindividual that made the diagnoses.  For purposes of the disqualifying condition, the \nperson that made the diagnose must be a qualified medical person or licensed social \nworker in a recognized alcohol treatment program, I find the AC DC \u00b6 22(d) (diagnosis \nby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or \npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence), and AC DC AG \u00b6 22 (e) (the \nevaluation of alcohol abuse or dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a \nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) have not been raised.  \nLikewise, there is no indication Applicant was directed to attend an alcohol rehabilitation \nprogram.  Therefore, AC DC, AG \u00b6 22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or \ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program) has not been raised.   \n \n \nSince Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and the government produced \nsubstantial evidence by way of exhibits to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 \n22(a) and (c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15).  An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government (See, ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n \nSecurity concerns for excess alcohol consumption can be mitigated by \nconsideration of Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) AG \u00b6 23(a) (so \nmuch times has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AC MC AG \u00b6 \n23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of action taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).  \nApplicant\u2019s most recent driving under the influence of alcohol incident was just four \nmonths ago.  He admits to the continued consumption of alcohol once or twice a week \nto the point of intoxication.  He last drank to the point of intoxication only five days \nbefore the hearing.  He has a history of alcohol abuse.  Because of the recent \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of intoxication and his continued consumption of \nalcohol with no indications of any attempts to stop, the alcohol-related incidents are \nlikely to recur.  He has not acknowledged he has an alcohol-related problem and has \nnot shown a pattern of responsible use.  Applicant has not mitigated security concerns \nfor alcohol consumption. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)  Appellant\u2019s two arrests and one \nconviction for a domestic related assault and battery in violation of state law, and the \nnon-judicial punishment for driving while intoxicated in the Air Force raises Criminal \nConduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmultiple lesser offenses), and CD DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted). \n \nCriminal conduct can be mitigated under Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC \nMC AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.)  Applicant and his wife were involved in marital disputes that led to \nassaults and criminal action in 2005 and 2006.  The criminal charges happened in the \nlast two to three years and not under unusual circumstances.  In addition, Applicant was \nconvicted in August 2008 of driving under the influence which shows that is criminal \nconduct is likely to recur and he has not been successfully rehabilitated.  Applicant has \nnot presented any information to establish that these type incidents will not happen \nagain or that he has been rehabilitated.  It is more likely that the criminal action of \ndomestic assault will recur.  Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns for \ncriminal conduct. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n \n \nThe security clearance system depends on the individual providing correct and \naccurate information.  If a person conceals or provides false information, the security \nclearance process cannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified \ninformation is in the best interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s false \ninformation to security investigators concerning the anger management course \ncompletion raises a security concerns under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \n(PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false and misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, \nor other official government representative).   \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  He states that he informed the security \ninvestigator that he had completed the anger management course because his attorney \ninformed him when he was sentenced that once he started the course, he would send a \nletter to the court.  Applicant admits that he did not complete the course but he believed \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe issue was \"resolved\" by his attorney.  He never informed anyone, including the \ninstructor, that he was dropping the course.  He did not verify with his attorney that he \ncould drop the course.  While there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, \nor falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the \ngovernment when applying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or \ninaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant knew he had not \ncompleted the course.  Applicant decided himself not to complete the course.  He \ninformed the investigator that he had completed the course.  He never informed him of \nany guidance from his attorney or that he had stopped attending classes on the advice \nof his attorney.  I find that Applicant deliberately provided false information to security \ninvestigators.  \n \n \nApplicant's failure to complete the anger management course raises security \nconcerns under PC DC AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules or regulation, or other characteristics \nindicating that he person may not properly safeguard protected information).  As part of \nhis sentence, Applicant was required to complete the course.  The information shows he \ndecided on his own not to complete the course and did not inform the counselor or his \nattorney of his intent.  This indicates a willingness on the part of Applicant to follow his \nown rules and not those directed for the protection of classified information \n \n \nI considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand determine none apply.  Applicant never made a good faith effort to correct \nerroneous or inaccurate information.  He has not acknowledged that his information was \nfalse, but merely that he misunderstood what his attorney advised him. He deliberately \ndecided not to follow the direction of his sentence and to take his own action. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness.  I have considered Applicant's 20 years of honorable \nservice in the Air Force.  There is no doubt that he is a gifted and talented air traffic \ncontroller who has performed exceptionally well in his field.  He was honest and \nforthright in presenting his information concerning the consumption of alcohol at the \nhearing.  However, Applicant had alcohol-related incidents for many years and \ncontinues to drink alcohol.  He drinks to excess at least once or twice a week.  His most \nrecent excess consumption of alcohol was only five days before the hearing.  He has \nnot admitted he has an alcohol problem.  He was involved in two domestic violence \nincidents with his wife that led to criminal activity and he provided false information \nconcerning a course he was required to complete to security investigators.  He did not \ncomplete the anger management course as required by his court imposed sentence.  \nApplicant has not presented sufficient information to show that his consumption of \nalcohol, his criminal conduct, and his personal conduct are not security concerns.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts that Applicant will not \nconsume alcohol to excess in the future.  I have doubts about his eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance because he provided false information to security \ninvestigators and engaged in domestic violence criminal acts.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption, personal conduct, and criminal conduct.  I conclude he is not eligible for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are; \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.b.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nDECISION \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.  \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________ \nThomas M.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on July 26, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an\nadministrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this\ncase fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial\nproblems and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification of a security-\nclearance application.  \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on August 23, 2007, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was initially assigned to another administrative judge and then reassigned to me\non October 24, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled on November 14, 2007, and\nthe transcript (Tr.) was received on November 26, 2007.\nThe record was left open until December 14, 2007, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit documentary evidence in addition to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and\nC. In particular, Applicant was invited to submit the following: (1) a recent credit report\nas she referred to in her testimony; (2) proof of payment for the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b and 1.c; (3) a letter from a medical doctor or other information documenting her\nhusband\u2019s diagnosis of and death from Pick\u2019s disease; and (4) any other information\nshe thought was relevant to her financial situation (Tr. 98\u2013102). No such matters were\nreceived and the record closed on December 14, 2007. For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided against Applicant. \nProcedural Rulings\nAt the hearing, the SOR was amended to conform to the evidence. In particular,\nSOR \u00b6 1.i was amended to show that Applicant is indebted to the IRS, not a county\nregister of deeds, pursuant to a federal tax lien filed in 2002 for the amount of $8,982\n(Tr. 28\u201330). Based on this amendment, Applicant changed her response to \u00b6 1.i from a\ndenial to an admission (Tr. 31\u201333). Also, Applicant changed her response to \u00b6 1.ff from\na denial to an admission (Tr. 58\u201359). \nIn addition, government counsel conceded that the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are\nthe same (Tr. 51\u201352). And government counsel conceded that the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and\n1.ff are the same (Tr. 57\u201359). These debts will be treated accordingly.  \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges multiple delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \u00b6 1.ii)\nranging from $20 to $8,982 for about $50,000 in total. Her response is mixed, admitting\nmany and denying several of the debts. Also, she denies the allegations that she made\ndeliberately false statements when answering three questions about her financial record\non a security-clearance application. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the\nfollowing facts are established by substantial evidence.\n\n3\nApplicant is a 52-year-old instructional systems designer. She has worked for her\ncurrent employer since November 2005 after relocating to her current state of residence\nafter the premature death of her husband. Her current annual salary is about $68,000.\nBefore her current job, Applicant worked in the field of education at the college or\nuniversity level for many years. Her educational background includes a master\u2019s degree\nin education. She is seeking to obtain a security clearance from the Defense\nDepartment for the first time.    \nApplicant married her husband in 1981. Their marriage produced two children.\nHer 22-year-old son is now a college student and she provides him nominal financial\nsupport as he is on scholarship. Her 15-year-old son lives with her and attends public\nschool. Her husband worked as a carpenter, and he was also primarily responsible for\nmanaging the family\u2019s finances. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems as evidenced by multiple delinquent\ndebts, five judgments, and a federal tax lien. As alleged in the SOR, these matters are\nestablished by credit reports and other documentary evidence (Exhibits 2, 5, 6, 8).\nApplicant maintains that she paid the two largest judgments as alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.c, but she did not produce documentary evidence to confirm her representations. The\nmost recent credit report from October 2007 shows these two judgments are unpaid\n(Exhibit 8). Applicant agrees the other debts are unpaid. She has consulted with two\nattorneys, both of whom recommended that she pursue a case in bankruptcy, but she\nelected not to because bankruptcy is against her ethics and she wants to pay her debts.\nOn October 1, 2007, she sent letters to the three major credit reporting agencies in an\neffort to dispute multiple accounts (Exhibits A, B, and C). The results of her letters are\nunknown. At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that she did not really have a plan to\nresolve the debts other than her intent was to start with the IRS (Tr. 77-78). She\nbelieves the federal tax lien is the result of not filing a return for 2001 (Tr. 53). Likewise,\nshe estimates that she likely owes taxes for 2002 and 2003 (Tr. 54). She has not filed\nreturns for these three years and is talking with a tax attorney about doing so (Tr.\n53\u201354).  \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to her husband\u2019s illness and\npremature death (Exhibit 3 at 5). He was diagnosed in about 2000 with Pick\u2019s disease,\nwhich is a rare neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive destruction of nerve\ncells in the brain. He passed away in November 2003 or October 2004, as there is\nconflicting information in the record (Exhibit 3 at 5 and Exhibit 1 at 20). \nBefore his diagnosis, he was often ill and behaved oddly. He was treated for\nmany things, from depression to the flu. After his diagnosis, he was unable to work, lost\nhis ability to speak, his motor skills declined, and he regressed until his death. He had\nalways managed the family\u2019s finances, including the filing of income tax returns.\nApplicant believes her husband\u2019s illness caused him to forget many things and\nsometime hide things from her as well. She assumed responsibility for financial matters\nin about 2000, but she did not really pay attention to the bills due to being preoccupied\nwith her husband\u2019s situation. As a result, for example, they had to sell their home in\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n4\n2001 and then rented it back from the buyer. The judgments in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are for\nunpaid rent. Describing another example, Applicant explained that $30,000 and three\nclassic cars her husband collected disappeared during this time and she did not know\nwhat exactly happened to the money and the cars (Tr. 86\u201387). \nTo obtain a security clearance, she completed a security-clearance application in\nSeptember 2006 (Exhibit 1). When signing the application, she certified that her\nstatements were true, complete, and correct to the best on her knowledge and belief\nand were made in good faith, and she acknowledged that a knowing and willful false\nstatement could be punished under federal law. In particular, she answered the\nfollowing questions about her financial record as follows:\n\u2022\nQuestion 27c\u2013asking if in the last seven years she had a lien placed against her\nfor failing to pay taxes or other debts, to which she replied \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed\nthe federal tax lien filed in 2002.\n\u2022\nQuestion 27d\u2013asking if in the last seven years she had any judgments against\nher that had not been paid, to which she replied \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose the five\njudgments alleged in the SOR. \n\u2022\nQuestion 28a\u2013asking if in the last seven years she had been over 180-days\ndelinquent on any debts, to which she replied \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed the debt\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but no others.\n\u2022\nQuestion 28b\u2013asking if she was currently over 90-days delinquent on any debts,\nto which she replied \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose any debts. \nIn testimony, she explained that she did not realize she had judgments against\nher (Tr. 66). Likewise, she did not list the other debts in response to Questions 28a and\n28b because she did not know about them at the time (Tr. 70).  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n5\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 10.\n15\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n17\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n18\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n19\n6\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n14\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to \u201c[c]onduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations [that may] raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or\nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d15\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made false statements when providing answers\nto three questions about her financial record when she completed a security-clearance\napplication. Applicant contends her answers were not deliberately false. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations, as set forth in the findings of fact, are credible. It\u2019s plain that she had\nneither a firm grasp nor a full understanding of her financial situation. In addition,\nApplicant did disclose some adverse financial information in response to two questions.\nHer disclosures tend to undermine or undercut the case that she was trying to hide her\nadverse financial history when she completed the security-clearance application.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant. \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n16\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n17\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. Her history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n18\n19\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions. In addition, the record evidence supports a\n\n DC 7 is \u201cfailure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing\n20\nof the same.\u201d\n7\nconclusion of financial irresponsibility because Applicant largely ignored her finances\nduring her husband\u2019s illness and after his death until confronted during the security\nclearance process. Also established during the hearing was the failure to file federal\nincome tax returns for 2001\u20132003. This evidence raises a third disqualifying condition\nthat must be considered.  \n20\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none\napply. Two deserve discussion. First, MC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014does not apply. Obviously, and understandably, the prolonged illness and\ndeath of Applicant\u2019 husband was a major factor that led to the financial problems. His\ninability to work reduced the family\u2019s income. And his illness preoccupied Applicant. The\nMC does not apply, however, because Applicant did not act reasonably under the\ncircumstances. Although it is to be expected that she would be preoccupied, she\nnonetheless had an obligation to manage the finances to the best of her ability. Some\nslippage could be expected and tolerated under the circumstances, but she essentially\nignored the situation while it was occurring and after her husband\u2019s death. This\ncontinued until 2006 or 2007 when she was confronted during the security-clearance\nprocess.  \nSecond, a potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to\ninitiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant has taken some positive steps to resolve the delinquent indebtedness by\nattempting to dispute the information in her credit reports (Exhibits A, B, and C). The\nresults of her efforts are unknown at this point. Also, she maintains she paid the\njudgments for the back rent, but she has not documented her claims. These efforts, in\nlight of the remaining unaddressed financial problems\u2014including the federal tax\nissue\u2014do not amount to a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. \nApplicant is 52 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about\nher finances. Although her intent to resolve her financial problems appears to be\ngenuine, she has done little so far to demonstrate her intent. What is missing here is (1)\na realistic and workable plan to clean up her financial house, (2) documented actions\ntaken in furtherance of the plan, and (3) a measurable improvement to the situation.\nGiven the current circumstances, it is likely that the financial problems will continue or\nrecur because Applicant is facing a mountain of financial problems, starting with the\nIRS. And more important, her inability or unwillingness to address her financial\nproblems until being confronted during the security clearance process indicates a lack\nof good judgment that is necessary to obtain access to classified information.\nAccordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet her\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\n\n8\nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131ii:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.c:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The Government offered five exhibits which \nApril 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5 without objection. The Applicant \noffered 19 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 S without \nobjection. Applicant and his wife, who also served as his personal representative \ntestified.  The record was held open until March 1, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence. On March 4, 2008, Applicant requested an additional delay and the \nrecord was held open until March 21, 2008. Applicant timely submitted a two-page \ndocument which was admitted as AE T without objection. The transcript was received \non February 19, 2008. The record closed on March 21, 2008. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant did not receive the Notice of Hearing within 15 days as required by \u00b6 \nE3.1.8 of the Directive.  He waived the 15 day advance notice. (Tr at 7.) \n \n \nOn February 4, 2008, the Government submitted a motion to amend the SOR by \nadding the following subparagraph under Guideline F:  \n \n \n1.h. A California State Tax Lien was filed against you on or about \n \nSeptember 13, 2007, in the approximate amount of $9,456. As of \n \nFebruary 4, 2008, this lien has not been satisfied. \n \n \nApplicant was served a copy of the motion to amend. At hearing, Applicant did \nnot object to the motion.  The SOR was amended. Applicant admitted to the new \nallegation. (Tr at 15-16.)    \n \n \nLater in the hearing, the Government motioned to amend the SOR in accordance \nwith \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive to add the following allegation: \n \n \n1.i.  You failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n \n2002 through 2006. \n \nApplicant did not object and the motion to amend was granted. (Tr at 107-108.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g, and denied the allegation in \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a local area network \nadministrator with the defense contractor since September 2005. He is married and has \nthree children, a daughter, age 20, and a son, age 25, from a prior marriage, and an \neight-year-old daughter with his current wife. (Tr at 21; Gov 1.)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn February 1, 2006, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). In response to the question 27(c) \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other \ndebts?\u201d, Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d In response to questions in Section 28 of e-QIP \nrelated to financial delinquencies, Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d and listed a credit card with \na $10,000 balance that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:  a $221 account that was more than 180 days delinquent (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a); a $10,628 charged off credit account (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $264 account that was more \nthan 180 days delinquent (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $3,058 state tax lien recorded against \nApplicant for tax year 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and a $5,183 state tax lien recorded against \nApplicant for tax year 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Gov 3.)  A credit report, dated February 4, \n2008, revealed an additional state tax lien in the amount of $9,456 filed against \nApplicant on September 13, 2007. (Gov 4.)   \n \nIn February 1997, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection. His dischargeable debts were discharged in May 1997. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g; Gov \n5.)  State and federal tax debts were listed in the bankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s wife states that \nthese were her tax debts which existed prior to their marriage in June 1996. (Tr at 49-\n50.) They did not attend any financial counseling in conjunction with the bankruptcy. (Tr \nat 50.)  \n    \nThe bankruptcy was the result of an on-the-job injury suffered by Applicant in \n1995. He was out of work due to the injury for approximately a year and a half from \nSeptember 1996 to December 1998.  He had surgery in September 1997. Applicant\u2019s \nincome went from $60,000 per year to $200 per week during this time. (Tr at 39-41; Gov \n1, section 11, items 11 and 12.)  \n \nAfter his injury, Applicant attended training in the computer career field. He \ncompleted school in November 1998. He began his new career field at the bottom level \ndoing temporary work for various agencies. He took six months off after his daughter \nwas born in April 1999 because his wife earned more income at the time. (Tr at 44.) \nBetween January 2001 and December 2004, he had no breaks in employment. (Tr at \n45.)  \n \nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer.  He \nresided in another state.  In December 2004, Applicant and his wife moved to that other \nstate to care for him.  His father-in-law passed away in December 2004 but they still \nfollowed through with their move. After moving, Applicant was unemployed for several \nmonths between January 2005 to April 2005.  He worked for two other companies \nbefore obtaining a job with his current employer in September 2005. (Tr at  45-46, 105-\n106; Gov 1 at Section 11.)  \n \nIn his response to interrogatories, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant indicated that  \nhe and his wife were taking out a home equity loan in order to pay the debts off. (Gov \n\n \n4 \n \n \n2.) They refinanced the home in the amount of $50,000 in September 2007.  They used \nthe money to resolve several of the debts alleged in the SOR and pay down credit card \nbalances. Approximately $18,000 is left over which they intend to apply towards \nresolving their tax issues. (Tr at 102-103; AE G; AE H.) Applicant currently has \napproximately $1,500 to $1,800 left over each month after expenses. (Tr at 99.) \n \nThe current status of the debts are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Gas bill for $221.  Account was settled and paid in full on October 3, \n2007. (Tr at 55-56; AE D; AE N; Gov 4 at 1.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $10,628 charged off credit card account. Account was settled for \n$9,091 on September 17, 2007. (Tr at 56-57, 62-63; AE C; AE F; AE M; Gov 4 at 2.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $264 account. Applicant disputes this account. He does not \nrecognize the account.  He formally disputed the account to the credit bureaus on \nOctober 5, 2007.  He has not received a response to the formal dispute. (Tr at 63 \u2013 67; \nGov 3 at 5; AE E; AE F.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d:  $3,058 state tax lien for tax year 2002.  Applicant\u2019s wife arranged to \nhave an accountant friend do their taxes for tax years 2002 and 2003. They believed \nthat they were under an extension. They discovered in 2003 that the accountant did not \nfile their taxes.  On September 17, 2007, they paid the state tax lien. (Tr at 68-75; AE B; \nAE K.) They still have not filed tax returns for 2002 or 2003 but anticipate a refund when \nthey file. (Tr at 80-81.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $5,183 state tax lien for tax year 2003. Explanation same as the \nimmediate paragraph above pertaining to SOR \u00b6 1.d. On September 17, 2007, they \npaid the state tax lien. (Tr at 68-75; AE B; AE K.)  They still have not filed tax returns for \n2002 or 2003 but anticipate a refund when they file. (Tr at 80-81.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h:  $9,456 state tax lien for tax year 2004. They have not filed tax \nreturns for tax year 2004. The state tax lien has not been resolved. (Tr at 75-78; AE S.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: Applicant admits that they have not filed state or federal tax returns for \ntax years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. (Tr at 78-88.) After the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted a document indicating that they retained a certified public accountant on \nMarch 11, 2008, to handle all tax issues. (AE T.)  \n \nApplicant states that he was never aware of the tax issues until they were \naddressed during his background investigation. The state tax liens were first raised in \nJune 2007, when Applicant was sent interrogatories to answer pertaining to the tax \nissue. His wife later informed him of the other tax issues. (Tr at 72, 82-88.) Applicant\u2019s \nwife accepts full responsibility for the tax problems. She claims that she was responsible \nfor filing and paying the taxes and kept telling Applicant that everything was fine. (Tr at \n20, 76.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent performance evaluations indicate that he meets or exceeds \nstandards.  (AE P.)  The facilities manager of one of Applicant\u2019s former employers has \nknown Applicant for several years and states he has a \u201chigh degree of integrity, \nresponsibility, and ambition.\u201d Other co-workers describe him as dependable, honest and \nhard working. Three close personal friends wrote letters on his behalf describing similar \nattributes. (AE Q.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n6 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or the fraudulent filing of the same) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations. In 1997, he filed for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy. After his bankruptcy, Applicant incurred three delinquent consumer \naccounts with an approximate balance of $11,113.  In addition to the consumer debt \nApplicant incurred three state tax liens for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004, totaling \napproximately $17,697.  There may be additional tax debt. It was revealed during the \nhearing that Applicant and his wife have not filed federal and state tax returns for tax \nyears 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has a history of financial irresponsibility going back to 1997. Although \nApplicant resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e and formally \ndisputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, his tax issues remain unresolved. He still owes \nthe $9,456 tax lien for tax year 2004. Although he became aware of the tax issues in \nJune 2007, his state and federal tax returns for tax years 2002-2006 were not filed at \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe close of the record. After the hearing, an accountant was retained to assist in \nresolving his tax issues but no steps had been taken to resolve the matter.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s period of \nunemployment as a result of his on-the-job injury which resulted in the Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. However, it cannot be concluded that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances with regards to his federal and state income taxes. Applicant\u2019s wife \naccepts full responsibility for the tax problems. However, Applicant could have taken \nmore proactive steps to insure his state and federal income taxes were being filed. For \nthis reason, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.    \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  While several of the debts are resolved, Applicant\u2019s state and federal tax \nreturns for tax years 2002-2006 were not filed at the close of the record and it is unlikely \nthe tax issues will be resolved in the near future.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, in part, with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. 1.b. \n1.d, and 1.e. However, Applicant\u2019s state and federal tax problems remain. The $9,456 \nstate tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was not resolved even though Applicant apparently \nhad money available from his home refinancing.  Applicant became aware that he had \ntax issues in June 2007.  He took no action until after the close of the record, more than \nfive months later, to retain an accountant to assist with his tax problems.     \n \n \nFC MC \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) does not apply.  Although Applicant disputes the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, he \ndid not formally dispute the debt until after the SOR was issued. This issue remained \nunresolved at the close of the record.    \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his state \ntax liens for tax years 2002 and 2003 in response to section 27(c) on his e-QIP \napplication. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 17(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies to this \nallegation. Applicant claims he was unaware of the tax liens. He claims he was not \naware of the tax issues until he was sent interrogatories in June 2007. There is nothing \nin the record evidence indicating that he was aware of the state tax liens when he filled \nout the e-QIP application on September 14, 2006. I find Applicant did not deliberately \nwithhold this information when filling out his security clearance questionnaire.  I find for \nApplicant with respect to the personal conduct concern.   \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork evaluations, reference letters, and his efforts to resolve some of the accounts.  I \nalso considered Applicant\u2019s past financial problems which resulted in his filing for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997 and his unresolved state and federal tax issues. Despite, \nhis wife\u2019s claims that she is responsible for the tax problems, Applicant should have \nbeen more proactive in ensuring that his state and federal tax returns were filed. Once \nhe discovered the tax issues in June 2007, he took no steps to file his federal and state \ntax returns over a period of five months. He did not retain an accountant to assist with \nthe matter until after the hearing. At the close of the record, the state and federal tax \nreturns for tax years 2002-2006 still had not been filed.    \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and they are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old Ordinary Seaman who had worked for a federal contractor since 2003. He is not married and has no children. Applicant used marijuana from 1991 until at least 2003 with varying frequency. He used cocaine from at least March 1993 until at least August 2006 with varying frequency. He used Ecstasy from 1999 until 2004 with varying frequency. He also used LSD and mushrooms twice in approximately 1993. Applicant purchased cocaine from approximately 1995 until at least 2005. He also purchased Ecstasy from approximately 1999 until at least 2004 with varying frequency. In about August 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Hit and Run and Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He pled no contest to the Hit and Run and was convicted of the DUI. He was sentenced to community service, fined approximately $1,800, required to attend a six month alcohol program, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn September 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines H, G, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 11, 2007, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on October 24, 2007. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant on October 29, 2007, and it was received on November 20, 2007. \n \n1 \n \n \n)\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM, but submitted \nadditional information in a timely manner. Department Counsel did not object to the \nadditional information. The case was assigned to me on January 15, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and they are incorporated \nherein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \nstatements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old Ordinary Seaman who had worked for a federal \ncontractor since 2003. He is not married and has no children.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1991 until at least 2003 with varying frequency. \nHe used cocaine from at least March 1993 until at least August 2006 with varying \nfrequency. He used Ecstasy from 1999 until 2004 with varying frequency. He also used \nLSD and mushrooms twice in approximately 1993.  \n \n \nApplicant purchased cocaine from approximately 1995 until at least 2005. He \nalso purchased Ecstasy from approximately 1999 until at least 2004 with varying \nfrequency.  \n \n \nIn about August 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Hit and Run and \nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He pled no contest to the Hit and Run and \nwas convicted of the DUI. He was sentenced to community service, fined approximately \n$1,800, required to attend a six month alcohol program, and his driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended.  \n \n \nOn about December 11, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He \npled nolo contender and was sentenced to 365 days in jail, 5 years probation, and fined \napproximately $1,800. The punishment was deferred upon completion of an 18 month \nalcohol program in about May 2007. \n \n \n \nIn response to interrogatory questions, Applicant indicated he continues to drink \nalcohol and intends to continue in the future. He also indicated that he attended two \ncourt imposed DUI programs, one in 1999 and another in 2004.1 In response to \nquestions about his use of illegal substances, he stated \u201cafter my last DUI in December \n2004 I matured and decided to move on and grow up. I rarely go out or drink so I \nbasically stopped 2005 January on (sic) but slipped up August 2006.\u201d2 In response to a \nquestion as to why he decided to stop using illegal substances, he stated: \u201cIn my 20\u2019s I \nlike to go out, now I am getting married and want to prosper in life in every aspect. \n \n1 GE 5. \n \n2 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nHealth has become a priority also.\u201d3 He indicated he rarely goes out or drinks and \nfurther stated \u201cso I basically stopped 2005 January.\u201d4 Applicant indicated he does not \nintend to use illegal drugs in the future because he is getting married and wants \u201cto \nprosper in my life in every aspect.\u201d5  \n \n \nApplicant checked a box in answering an interrogatory question concerning if he \nstill associated with the same people with whom he used drugs. He checked \u201cno.\u201d He \ndid not provide any other amplifying information about what substantive changes he has \nmade in his life. On his SCA, Question 12 asked him to list three people who know him \nwell. One person he listed knew him from 1989 to the present. This same person he \nlisted in his interrogatories as a person with whom he used drugs.6  \n \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his security clearance application (SCA) when his \nresponse was \u201cNo\u201d to Question 24, which asked if he had illegally used any controlled \nsubstance in the last 7 years or since the age of 16. He also denied purchasing illegal \ndrugs, which was false. He falsified material facts during an interview with an authorized \ninvestigator of the Office of Personnel Management on about January 24, 2007. He \ninitially indicated his last use of marijuana was 1999, which was false. He had in fact \ncontinued to use marijuana until 2003. He also failed to provide information about his \npast illegal drug use until confronted with previous admissions he had made during his \nalcohol treatment program. He did not provide his illegal drug use information on his \nSCA because he thought it would look bad and he was immature. Applicant deliberately \nand intentionally provided false answers on his SCA and later during his interview. 7 \n \n \nApplicant believes he is a good reliable person who has made some poor \ndecisions, but has always been a good family member, friend and co-worker. He takes \nhis job seriously and his life is improving. He plans to get married, buy a house, and \nstart a family. He is ashamed of his past. He indicated he rarely drinks, but has not \ntotally abstained.8  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n3 Id.. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 GE 4 and 5. \n \n7 GE 5. \n \n8Id; Supplemental information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n25 and especially considered (a) (any drug abuse) and (c) (illegal drug possession, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or \npossession of drug paraphernalia). Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs from at least \n1991 to August 2006. He purchased cocaine and Ecstasy with varying frequency from \n1995 to 2005. I find both of the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the drug involvement mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 \nand especially considered (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, \nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and (b) (a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence;(4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation). Applicant abused illegal \ndrugs from 1991 to 2006. He purchased illegal drugs from 1995 to 2005. His drug use \nspanned a period of more than 15 years. He indicated he does not intend to use drugs \nagain, but did not provide any information as to what steps he has taken to accomplish \nhis intention. He admits he has lapsed in the past. The last time he used illegal drugs \nwas in August 2006 when he used cocaine. His drug use is recent and frequent and \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I find (a) does not \napply. Considering how long he used illegal drugs, his most recent use of cocaine in \n2006, the fact he listed a friend with whom he used drugs on his SCA as a present \nfriend who knows him well, and that he failed to provide substantive information about \nany drug treatment, counseling, or significant consistent life changes, I find (b) does not \napply. Applicant did not provide any information that he has attended a prescribed drug \ntreatment program. Therefore, mitigating condition (d) does not apply \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \nI have considered all of the alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 22 and especially considered (a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such \nas driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.). Applicant has two arrests for DUI. He was to \ncomplete an 18 month alcohol program. No information was provided as to the status of \nthe program and the charges that were pending against him. No information was \nprovided regarding a diagnosis or prognosis. Applicant continues to consume alcohol. I \nfind (a) applies to the facts.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23. I especially considered (a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment), and (b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser). Applicant was arrested and convicted for his first DUI in 1999. He \ncontinued to drink alcohol and was arrested again in 2004 for DUI. His jail time was \ndeferred pending completion of an 18 month alcohol program. No information was \nprovided to establish the completion of the program, or if there was a diagnosis or \nprognosis. Although Applicant stated he has curtailed his alcohol use, he continues to \nuse it. Without additional information I find neither of the above mitigating conditions \napplies.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nI have considered all of the personal conduct disqualifying under AG \u00b6 16 and \nespecially considered (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfiduciary responsibilities) and (b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative) under this guideline. \nApplicant intentionally and deliberately falsified information about his illegal drug activity \non his SCA. He also intentionally and deliberately was untruthful in divulging his drug \nactivity when interviewed by the OPM investigator, until he was confronted with \nadmissions he had made during an alcohol program. I find both disqualifying conditions \napply.  \nI have considered the allegations in SOR \u00b6 3.c and d and conclude the facts \npertaining to the drug involvement and alcohol consumption security concerns are the \nsame for the personal conduct security concerns. No other factual allegations were \nmade regarding personal conduct as it pertains to these two subparagraphs. I find \nbased on the facts and the adjudicative guidelines there are no separate personal \nconduct disqualifying conditions applicable. Therefore, I will not address separately the \npersonal conduct allegations under the above paragraphs. \nI have considered all of the personal conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n16.  Applicant admitted he did not divulge the truth because he did not want to look bad. \nWhen he was provided an opportunity to divulge the information during his interview he \ndid not until he was confronted with the facts. After careful considerations of all of the \nfacts I conclude none of the personal conduct mitigating conditions applies. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long history of drug \nabuse and a short history of abstinence. He also has a long history of alcohol abuse \nand a short history of responsible alcohol consumption. He believes he has matured \nand wants to lead a good life. However, he intentionally and deliberately lied on his SCA \nand to the OPM investigator.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from drug \ninvolvement, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nDismissed \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \n \nDismissed \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
