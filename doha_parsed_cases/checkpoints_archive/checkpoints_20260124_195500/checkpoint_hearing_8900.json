A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

The Judge specifically stated that\nhe did not consider the bankruptcy under the Guideline F disqualifying conditions, although he took\nit into account in performing his whole-person analysis.2  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\ntreatment of the bankruptcy was not error and that Applicant was not denied the due process\nafforded by the Directive.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

There is insufficient information about his overall financial \nsituation and these five debts to mitigate security concerns. Access to classified \ninformation is denied at this time.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 21, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On September \n18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing \nthe basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nMay 15, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn October 9, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nOctober 16, 2008. The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2009. On February 6, \n2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 4, 2009. At the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-4) (Transcript (Tr.) 27), and \nApplicant offered 17 exhibits (AE A-R). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-\n4 (Tr. 27), and AE A-R. Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR, the \nhearing notice, and the amended hearing notice (GEs 5-8). I attached Department \nCounsel\u2019s closing argument as hearing exhibit (HE) I. I received the transcript on March \n23, 2009. I initially held the record open until April 10, 2009 (Tr. 18-19). At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest I held the record open until May 11, 2009. After the hearing Applicant submitted \n29 exhibits (AE S-AT). I received Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument on May 6, \n2009 (GE 9; HE I), and her response to Applicant\u2019s final exhibit (HE II; AE AT). I \nattached emails from Applicant, Department Counsel, and me, to the record as HE III. \nThese emails discuss setting the date for the hearing, holding the record open for \nadditional documents, jurisdiction, and the absence of objections to documents (HE III). \nI closed the record on May 11, 2009.     \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.g, 1.i, 1.k to 1.p, and 1.r to 1.u; and he denied responsibility for SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h, 1.j and 1.q. He said SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.i are duplications.   \n \nApplicant is 37 years old network engineer with 13 years of information \ntechnology experience (Tr. 8-9). He is a high school graduate, and attended two years \nof college (Tr. 8). He has an interim Secret clearance (Tr. 8-9). In 1996, he discharged \nhis unsecured debts using a Chapter 7 bankruptcy (Tr. 169-170). In 1999, he married \n(AE R). In 2000 and 2003, his two children were born (AE R). He separated from his \nspouse in 2004, and moved in with his parents (Tr. 55). He had a job from 1999 to \n2006; however, he was discharged from this employment because he spent so much \ntime trying to resolve family problems (Tr. 55-56, 132). The family court records relating \nto his divorce list 16 pages of meetings, hearings, motions, orders and arbitrations, \nmostly concerning disputes over property, support, allegations of abuse and obstruction \nof visitation (AE Q, R). The court granted his divorce in January 2008 (AE A at 5). \n \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nAfter losing his seven-year employment in June 2006, he was intermittently \nunemployed for brief periods of time (Tr. 134-137). Applicant started his employment \nwith his current employer in April 2007 (Tr. 138). In January 2008, he became a \nsubcontractor (Tr. 150). He is the sole employee of his company (Tr. 151). \n \nIn 2005, Applicant took money out of his 401K account and he began to invest in \nreal estate (Tr. 56, 131, 132, 135). He purchased five houses (Tr. 56, 129, 131, 132, \n136). His spouse and Applicant ended their separation, and their family moved into one \nof the investment houses (Tr. 56-57, 129-130). He sold two houses for a profit (Tr. 131-\n132). He refinanced his mortgages or obtained second mortgages to raise money (Tr. \n131-132). He was able to pay the mortgages on the three houses until 2007 (Tr. 130-\n131). Those three houses subsequently were foreclosed, resulting in substantial \ndeficiencies. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and the downturn in the \nreal estate market (Tr. 25-26). His September 29, 2007, credit report showed his \naccounts were in good standing (Tr. 140; GE 4). The total payments on his mortgages \nwere about $13,000 to $17,000 per month, and without tenants he had a major financial \nproblem (Tr. 141). Due to the neglect of his tenants, two of his houses were in shambles \n(one had serious water damage) and could not be rented (Tr. 141, 143). His main debts \nresulted from three houses that were into foreclosure. Those three houses had a total of \nfive mortgages (AE S at 1-2).  \n \nApplicant paid or satisfactorily disputed 14 debts, which are the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.g, 1.k, 1.p to 1.u. Two debts are in current payment plans, which are the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j. There is insufficient evidence to resolve five debts, which are the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. The source, status, and amount of his \nindividual SOR debts are more specifically described as follows (paragraph letters \ncorrespond with the SOR subparagraphs): \n  \n(a) Credit card debt of $12,216 was settled for $3,665 and paid on January 28, \n2009 (Tr. 59-65; GE 3; AE B and C; AE S at 2); \n \n(b) Bank debt of $1,470 was settled for $642 and paid on January 29, 2009 (Tr. \n66-69; AE D and E at 4; AE S at 2); \n \n(c) On February 27, 2009, Applicant and creditor reached a settlement \nagreement to resolve his share trading debt of $11,349 (Tr. 69-73; AE F; AE V). The \nsettlement agreement with the creditor required Applicant to make three payments of \n$1,891 (totaling $5,674), with a payment required every thirty days (Tr. 72; AE F). The \nfirst payment was required along with a signed settlement agreement (AE F). At his \nhearing, he said on February 28, 2009, or March 1, 2009, he made one payment of \n$1,891 (Tr. 72). However, he noted the payment was not reflected in his monthly bank \nstatement (AE E). On March 20, 2009, the creditor offered to settle the $11,349 debt for \n\n \n \n4 \n \n$3,404 (AE V). The March 20, 2009, settlement agreement did not indicate any \npayments were made, and the balance owed was the same as on the February 27, \n2009, settlement agreement. He provided his customer copy of a MoneyGram, dated \nApril 3, 2009, showing payment of $3,404 to the creditor, resolving this debt (Tr. 73; AE \nS at 2; AE U). \n \n(d) Credit card debt of $3,997 was settled for $1,400 and paid on February 13, \n2009 (Tr. 74-77; AE E at 3; AE G; AE S at 2). \n \n(e) Department store credit card debt of $3,868 was settled for $1,547 on \nJanuary 29, 2009, and paid (Tr. 78-79; AE E at 4; AE H; AE S at 2; AE O at 47).  \n \n(f) Debt of $22,320 with a payment plan, dated February 11, 2009, with payments  \nto be made on February 28, March 30, and April 29, 2009 (Tr. 80-81; AE E at 7; AE I). \nHe provided a settlement for an account, dated April 8, 2009, showing three monthly \npayments of $3,720 required to resolve the debt (AE AA, AE AB). He provided proof \nthat he paid $3,720 on March 31, 2009, and April 29, 2009 (Tr. 81; AE S at 2; AE AB). \nOn May 11, 2009, I received a receipt from creditor indicating Applicant paid the creditor \n$11,160 on April 30, 2009, settling and resolving this debt (AE AT). \n \n(g) Credit card debt of $6,018 was settled for $1,806 on January 28, 2009, and \npaid on February 28, 2009 (Tr. 81-83; AE E at 4; AE J; AE S at 2; AE AC; AE AD).   \n \n(h) Child support debt of $6,312\u2014payment summary shows he made every \nmonthly payment of $1,300 starting in February 2008 (Tr. 83-87; AE K). According to \nthe statement, he is paying $278 monthly towards his arrears (AE K; AE S at 3). \nAccording to his credit report of April 29, 2009, in April 2009, arrears were down to \n$6,097 (AE AO at 84). His account is current in so far as the collection agency is \nsatisfied that he is making progress reducing his arrearage (AE K, AE S at 3). \n \n(i) Applicant had a mortgage past due debt of $48,450 with a loan balance of \n$398,000 (Tr. 87-89; SOR \u00b6 1.i). In February 2005, Applicant purchased a property to \nuse as a rental (AE A at 1-2). In January 2007, his tenants moved out and Applicant \nunsuccessfully attempted to sell the property (AE A at 2). His credit report, dated August \n21, 2008, indicates he initiated a mortgage on the property in October 2006 (GE 3 at 3). \nAccording to his August 21, 2008, credit report, the initial amount of the October 2006 \nmortgage was $351,000; the monthly payment was $3,165; and the current balance \nwas $398,000 (GE 3 at 3). The lender foreclosed on the loan (Tr. 88). At the time of his \nhearing, Applicant said he did not have any documentation from the foreclosure sale \n(Tr. 87-88). Applicant thought the property was sold for a sufficient amount to cover the \nmortgage (Tr. 88; AE C at 1; AE S at 3). He stated, \u201cSo, it\u2019s foreclosed on, but I believe \nthey got the full value for the property.  .  .  . But regardless, they got their money that \nwas owed.\u201d Department Counsel asked, \u201cSo if I understand your testimony, you believe \nit was sold for the full amount of the mortgage and you owe nothing?\u201d He responded, \n\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d (Tr. 88). His basis for believing he did not owe anything was a credit \nreport that did not indicate he owed anything on the debt (AE C at 1). After his hearing, \n\n \n \n5 \n \nhe provided documentation showing he executed a mortgage for $351,500 on \nSeptember 12, 2007 (AE AE at 18). The auction on September 17, 2008, resulted in a \nsales price of $174,250 (AE AE at 3). He did not provide a recitation or summary of the \ncosts and the amount of the deficiency on this property. This property did not have a \nsecond mortgage (AE S at 2). Applicant\u2019s April 29, 2009, credit report indicates, \u201cCredit \ngrantor reclaimed collateral to settle defaulted mortgage account information disputed \nby consumer\u201d (AE AO at 16). It also shows amount past due as $0 (AE AO at 16). \nHowever, there is no court document or letter from the credit grantor agreeing to accept \nthe property to settle the debt or declining to seek a deficiency judgment against \nApplicant. There is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant does not owe about \n$224,000 plus costs and interest on this property (based on the difference between the \ncurrent loan balance (about $398,000) and the amount received from the foreclosure \n($174,250)). Auction and trustee costs as well as interest may add to the $224,000 \npotential deficiency.  \n \n(j) From January 9 to February 18, 2009, Applicant made payments of $1,317, \n$1,327, $1,327 and $1,307 on his automobile BMW lease debt of $3,940 (Tr. 90-92; AE \nE at 2-3, 6). The BMW-lease originated in February 2006, and the lease amount was \n$80,725 (AE T at 21, AE AO at 23, 25). He is current on his BMW-lease payments (Tr. \n92; AE S at 3). \n \n(k) Credit card debt of $12,024 was settled for $4,000 on February 4, 2009, and \nthe debt was paid on April 7, 2009 (Tr. 93-97; GE 2 at 2; AE L; AE S at 3; AE T at 5; AE \nAF). \n \n(l) Real estate mortgage loan with $27,339 in arrears on the $276,000 mortgage \nthat was foreclosed (Tr. 98-105; AE M). On November 19, 2008, the property was sold \nfor $301,400 (Tr. 100; AE M; AE Y). Applicant had previously purchased the property on \nFebruary 14, 2005, for $273,800 (AE M at 2, state tax record). Applicant\u2019s credit report \nof April 9, 2009, showed the amount of the overdue interest as $47,844, with monthly \npayments of $2,278 (AE AO at 11, 74, 82). The sale resulted in a deficiency of $20,816, \nwhich includes a Trustee Commission of $15,070 and accrued interest of $13,640 (AE \nZ). Applicant did not receive any proceeds from the sale (Tr. 102). The debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.n of $69,000 is the debt owed on the second mortgage account, which Applicant still \nowes (Tr. 106; AE S at 3). For the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, I conclude Applicant owes the \ndeficiency amount of approximately $21,000.  \n \n(m) Truck loan debt of $27,339 involved Applicant\u2019s purchase of a used truck on \nJanuary 5, 2007 (Tr. 107-116; AE AG). The truck was damaged by vandalism and had \nmechanical trouble (Tr. 107-116). In December 2008, Applicant signed an agreement to \nhave the vehicle repaired with an estimate of $6,673 (AE N). However, another portion \nof the estimate indicates the total job will cost $13,174 (AE N). Applicant signed that \nportion of the estimate and agreed to be responsible for paying $6,500 (AE N). Some \nrepairs were made and Applicant thought the vehicle repair company may have placed \na mechanic\u2019s lien for $6,000 on the vehicle (Tr. 109, 113; AE N). The estimate also \nshows monthly storage costs of $1,000 (AE N). Applicant said he paid his deductible \n\n \n \n6 \n \nand his insurance was disputing the amount of the repairs (Tr. 165). Applicant agreed \nwith Department Counsel\u2019s statement that he paid $6,500 and the insurance company \nwas supposed to pay the remainder of $13,173 bill (Tr. 165). He said he had proof of \nthe $6,500 payment, Department Counsel asked for proof of it, and Applicant agreed to \nprovide it (Tr. 166; AE S at 3). Applicant financed $30,212 (AE AG). Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport of April 29, 2009, showed a balance of $28,990 and a past due amount of $3,202 \n(AE AO at 31). An undated document indicates the vehicle repair firm is undertaking a \nnon-judicial sale of the truck (AE AG). Applicant did not provide any documentation \nshowing he paid any of the repair bill. I conclude Applicant owes about $28,000 on this \ndebt. \n \n(n) Real estate mortgage loan of $69,000 is in settlement negotiations (Tr. 106-\n107; AE S at 3). This is the same creditor as in SOR \u00b6 1.l (AE S at 3). Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport of April 29, 2009, shows this account in delinquent status (AE AO at 73). I \nconclude Applicant owes about $69,000 on this debt. \n \n(o) Mortgage loan of $359,650 pertained to Applicant\u2019s personal residence (Tr. \n116). His former wife stayed in their residence after the divorce (Tr. 116-117). The \nmortgage was not paid and the house went into foreclosure (Tr. 117). On August 29, \n2005, Applicant purchased the property for $499,000 (AE P at 1). On December 17, \n2007, the sale price was $374,808 and notification of the owner was by newspaper (AE \nP at 1; AE AJ). A 2008 IRS Form 1099-A shows a fair market value of $372,165 (AE O). \nApplicant has a taxable gain in income of about $12,000; however, he can offset that \nwith expenses on his transaction. The court issued a final order on the foreclosure on \nApril 29, 2008 (AE P at 7). The expenses of sale were $22,540 (AE P). On April 29, \n2008, the court issued a final order (AE P). On September 15, 2008, Applicant \nchallenged the sale (AE P at 3-6). On January 16, 2009, the court issued an order \ndenying Applicant\u2019s requested exceptions (AE P at 2). Ultimately, he had a remaining \ndeficiency of $17,856 (AE P at 8). This deficiency included a \u201cTrustee\u2019s Commission\u201d of \n$18,740 (AE P at 8). However, Applicant thought he did not owe the creditor on the first \nmortgage anything (Tr. 122). There was a second mortgage on the property of \n$158,616 (AE P at 12), which Applicant settled for $5,000 (Tr. 121-122; AE P at 12). \nThe $5,000 from Applicant was due on March 6, 2009 (Tr. 122; AE P at 12). A letter \nfrom the creditor, dated April 2, 2009, shows the $5,000 was paid, resolving this debt \n(AE AK, AL). Applicant understands that he will still owe a substantial federal tax bill as \na result of the release of liability for this second mortgage (the savings is about \n$153,000) (Tr. 167-168). Of course, he will be able to offset most of the tax liability with \nhis loss on the investment property. In sum, Applicant currently owes the first \nmortgagee about $17,000.    \n \n(p) Utility debt of $230 was unresolved because the creditor could not locate \ninformation on the account (Tr. 125-128). Applicant thought it might be a debt from one \nof the tenants in one of Applicant\u2019s houses (Tr. 141; AE S at 3). On April 7, 2009, the \ncreditor wrote and requested that the credit reporting agency remove the debt from \nApplicant\u2019s report (AE AI). \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n(q) Applicant said a home improvement loan of $944 was paid, and Applicant \npromised to provide proof of the payment (Tr. 122). However, no proof of payment was \nprovided. Applicant\u2019s credit report of April 29, 2009, shows a credit card account to a \ndifferent creditor with an amount of $949 with a zero balance, and paid as agreed (AE \nAO at 34).  It is listed in the closed accounts section of the report (AE AO at 43-44).  \n \n(r) Insurance debt of $225 was unresolved until after his hearing because \nApplicant forgot about this debt (Tr. 127-128). On April 7, 2009, Applicant received a \nletter indicating the debt was paid on June 18, 2007 (AE AH, AM). \n \n(s)-(u) Traffic ticket debts of $100, 105 and 100, respectively (Tr. 28; GE 4 at 20). \nAt his hearing, Applicant said these tickets were unresolved (Tr. 129). However, he \npromised to check into the tickets and to pay if they were his responsibility (Tr. 129). He \npaid two tickets of $105 each on March 18, 2009 (AE AN). The ticket-debts did not \nappear on his March 3, 2009, credit report (GE 2). I find For Applicant on these three \nalleged debts.   \n \nApplicant contended that the only mortgage account he still owed was listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($69,000) (Tr. 159-160).  \n \nApplicant disclosed a non-SOR, second mortgage debt of about $47,000 that he \ndisputed (GE 2 at 3; GE 4 at 18; AE AO at 5, 78, 86-87). The loan was made in \nFebruary 2006 (GE 4 at 18). By August 2007, the past due amount was $1,189 (GE 4 at \n8). The dispute is noted in his April 29, 2009 credit report (AE AO at 78). On his April \n29, 2009, credit report, the past due amount was listed at $9,973 (AE AO at 5, 78, 86-\n87). Applicant provided a warranty deed dated November 16, 2006, in which he \npromises clear title on the property (AE AP). Applicant did not provide a copy of the \nagreement between himself and the creditor, or explain how the warranty deed resolved \nthe delinquent debt. Because this document was not listed in the SOR, I decline to \nmake an adverse finding based on this debt.  \n \nApplicant does not receive any rent income (Tr. 161). He has not bought any new \ncars or taken out any new credit cards in the last year (Tr. 161). He has not recently \npurchased any expensive items (Tr. 162). He believed he would have all of his \nremaining debt paid in five months (Tr. 162). After he eliminates his delinquent debt, he \nplans to move out of his mother\u2019s residence (Tr. 163, 164). He promised to resolve the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.m (Tr. 164).  \n \nApplicant provided a receipt showing a non-SOR credit card account with a \nbalance of $2,598 was paid on March 10, 2009 (AE X).  \n \nApplicant did not maintain a formal budget of his accounts (Tr. 145). After taxes, \nhis current income is about $14,000 (Tr. 146).  In December 2008, he moved back in \nwith his mother and he pays her $1,500 a month for rent (Tr. 147). He also pays for \ngroceries (Tr. 147). He pays $1,300 a month for his BMW lease (Tr. 148). In April 2009, \n\n \n \n8 \n \nthe lease is up and he intends to obtain a less expensive vehicle (Tr. 148). His child \nsupport payment is $1,300 per month (Tr. 149).  \n \nOn November 1, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant (AE A). Applicant disclosed his gross monthly income was \n$10,000, and his monthly expenses totaled $6,674 (AE A at 3). Four expenses were \n$500 or more: (1) $3,000 for rent; (2) $500 for utilities; (3) $650 for car expenses; and \n(4) $1,574 for alimony/child support/day care (AE A at 3). His monthly debt payments \ntotal $12,377, and six debts required monthly payments exceeding $300: (1) creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.o plus a home equity loan for $36,000 (see AE T at 22) ($3,000 monthly \npayment); (2) SOR \u00b6 1.i ($3,165 monthly payment); (3) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n ($2,858 \nmonthly payment); (4) SOR \u00b6 1.j ($1,316 monthly payment); (5) SOR \u00b6 1.m debt ($640 \nmonthly payment on $28,890 debt-see AE T at 9; AE AO at 31); and (6) non-SOR debt \n($475 monthly payment on $47,500 debt-see AE T at 8). Once Applicant divests himself \nof the three homes, his monthly expenses would only exceed his income by $28 (AE A \nat 3). Department Counsel requested an updated personal financial statement, and \nApplicant agreed to provide one (Tr. 158-159, 171). However, Applicant did not \nsubsequently provide an updated personal financial statement.  \n \nApplicant provided a checking account statement for January 2, 2009, to March \n3, 2009 (AE E). This statement lists more than $30,000 in debits, and several deposits \nare crossed out (AE E). When asked about how he had so much money in his account, \nApplicant explained that when he became a contractor \u201cit freed up more money\u201d (Tr. \n172). He also raised the possibility of third-party, private real estate investors providing \nfunds, and then concluded, \u201cSo I didn\u2019t get a lump sum from anywhere. It\u2019s just that \nmore money was available to me because of the way I was getting paid from [ ] my \ncurrent [ ] employer.\u201d (Tr. 172).   \n  \nApplicant has not received financial counseling (Tr. 172). He agreed to seek \nfinancial counseling (Tr. 173). He did not provide evidence that he completed financial \ncounseling. \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has known Applicant since 2006 (Tr. 31, 51). She explained \nthat Applicant\u2019s divorce and court-ordered child support took a toll on Applicant\u2019s \nfinances (Tr. 31, 42, 48). The judge ordered him to pay his arrearage in child support, \neven though he had paid quite a large amount of the children\u2019s expenses (Tr. 48-49). \nHe had to pay for daycare, and medical insurance (Tr. 33). His former spouse stopped \nmaking car payments and he was legally responsible for the car loan (Tr. 33). He hired \na company to recover the car (Tr. 46-48). The car was recovered and sold (Tr. 53). His \ntenants moved out of his two houses for various reasons (Tr. 32). They left the \nproperties in poor condition and Applicant could not afford repairs (Tr. 32, 46-47). One \nhad significant water damage (Tr. 46). She attended Applicant\u2019s court hearings, relating \nto his divorce (Tr. 35, 44-45). She assisted Applicant in the organization of his financial \nrecords (Tr. 43). He worked some extra hours to increase his income (Tr. 51). Applicant \n\n \n \n9 \n \nis loyal, very reliable and responsible (Tr. 33-34). He has excellent work habits and is \nvery trustworthy (Tr. 34).   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n \n10 \n \n                                           \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had   \n[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his credit reports, his SOR response and at his hearing. Because \nApplicant\u2019s 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy was not listed in the SOR, I decline to consider it \nunder AG \u00b6 19(c).2 However, 21 delinquent debts were listed in the SOR, and in \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response he admitted responsibility for all except three of them. He \nfailed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 19(a) and further inquiry about the applicability of \nmitigating conditions is required. \n   \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n2 His 1996 bankruptcy is considered under the whole person concept, at pages 14-15, infra.  \n\n \n \n11 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) or \n20(e) because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) because his \nfinancial problems initially resulted because of his acrimonious divorce and his brief \nintermittent periods of unemployment. The real estate downturn was even more \nimportant and damaging to his financial situation. He receives substantial mitigating \ncredit because he established these unforeseeable events and linked them to his \nfinancial predicament. However, I am not convinced his financial problems occurred \nunder such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2007, and by 2008 almost all of the SOR \ndebts were delinquent. The SOR was issued in October 2008. Nevertheless, he did not \nbegin paying his SOR debts until January 2009. From January to April 2009, he \naggressively endeavored to resolve his delinquent debts. He settled and paid, paid or \notherwise resolved 14 of 21 SOR debts, and two debts are in payment plans, which are \napparently satisfactory to the creditors. His actions on these 16 SOR debts show he \n\n \n \n12 \n \n                                           \nacted responsibly under the circumstances for those 16 debts.3 AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.q and 1.s to 1.u. Those five debts were either paid, or the creditor could \nnot locate the account. I consider them to be successfully disputed. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant did not receive financial counseling \nand there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.\u201d However, he receives some credit because he has a sophisticated knowledge \nof debts, settlements, mortgages, and finances. He understands the security \nimplications of delinquent debt. He has also established some, but not full mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed some good faith4 in the resolution of his SOR \ndebts through his negotiation and settlement of other resolution of 16 of his 21 SOR \ndebts. He also has shown good faith in the restoration of currency for two of his SOR \ndebts that are in payment plans. However, he cannot receive full credit because five \nlarge debts totaling about $350,000 were not sufficiently established as resolved.  He \nlived beyond his means (as indicated, for example, by his February 2006 BMW lease, \ntotaling $80,725) and he did not show financial responsibility when he refinanced his \nproperties, and took out second mortgages in order to pull more cash out of the \nproperties. He did not provide sufficient information about what he did with the funds he \nborrowed on those mortgages. There is insufficient documentary evidence of his \nfinancial actions over the last four years to fully establish mitigating under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nor 20(d).       \n \nThe lack of sufficient financial information was emphasized as a possible security \nconcern in ISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 4-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008), where the Appeal \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n13 \n \nBoard focused on the judge\u2019s responsibility to determine where an Applicant obtained a \nlarge sum of money to pay debts listed in the SOR stating: \n \n.  .  .  the Judge has significantly undercut the validity of his analysis of \nmatters in mitigation in this case by focusing only on the current status of \nthe debt owed the IRS and by not considering Applicant\u2019s overall debt \npicture. While it is true that the outstanding debt to the IRS has been \nsubstantially reduced through refund intercepts and payments made by \nApplicant and his wife, Applicant and his wife have made most of this \nprogress by incurring new debt in the form of a $30,000 loan and $6,200 \nworth of credit card charges. The record evidence clearly indicates that \nApplicant has, in effect, done little more than transfer a large part of his \noutstanding IRS debt to new, apparently current, debts with private \nlenders. Any comprehensive evaluation of Applicant\u2019s current financial \nstatus (which includes a determination of just how mitigating Applicant\u2019s \npartial satisfaction of his IRS debt is in the context of the totality of the \nrecord evidence) must contain an acknowledgment of this fact along with \nsome analysis of how it affects Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. Yet the \n\u201cConclusions\u201d section of the Judge\u2019s decision contains no such analysis, \nand the Judge instead restricts his comments solely to the reduction of the \nIRS debt and the plan to retire the debt in the future. By failing to discuss \nthe significance of the debts incurred to reduce the IRS debt, including \nsome evaluation of Applicant\u2019s future ability to repay the private debts in \naddition to the remaining IRS debt, the Judge ignored an important aspect \nof the case. This was error. \n \nId. at 4.  From January to April 2009, Applicant paid $48,946 as indicated below \nto resolve most of his SOR debts:  \n \n(1) January 2009 ($8,471): 1.a ($3,665), 1.b ($642), 1.e ($1,547), 1.h \n($1,300); 1.j ($1,317); \n \n(2) February 2009 ($4,027): 1.d ($1,400), 1.h ($1,300), 1.j ($1,327);  \n \n(3) March 2009 ($11,557): 1.f ($3,720), 1.h ($1,300), 1.j ($1,327), 1.o (2nd \nmortgage $5,000); 1.s to 1.u ($210); and  \n \n(4) April 2009 ($24,891): 1.c ($3,404), 1.f ($3,720), 1.f ($11,160), 1.h \n($1,300), 1.j ($1,307), 1.k ($4,000).   \n \nApplicant agreed to provide a personal financial statement, indicating his income, \nall of his expenses, and debt payments each month (Tr. 158-159). I reinforced the \nimportance of including every debt on his personal financial statement, especially in \nlight of his negative income statement provided to the OPM investigator (Tr. 170-171). \nHowever, Applicant did not provide a personal financial statement.  He did not provide \nproof that he paid his share of the repairs on his truck (SOR \u00b6 1.m). He erroneously \n\n \n \n14 \n \nstated he had a payment plan and made the initial $1,891 payment on the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c.  He said he thought the sale price on one property was sufficient to cover the \nmortgage when the actual sale price was $224,000 less than the mortgage plus interest. \nSee discussion relating to SOR \u00b6 1.i, supra at page 4.  I do not intend to imply Applicant \nis dishonest, but point out these mistakes to emphasize the importance of receiving \ncomplete documentation in this case so that I can better understand the flow of financial \ntransactions and better determine the issue of financial responsibility.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. His actions to date are insufficient to fully apply \nany of the mitigating conditions.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nSome mitigating evidence under the whole person concept tends to support \napproval of a security clearance. Applicant is 37 years old with an established \nemployment record. There is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding \ncitizen. Applicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through \nhis service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and through his hard work in \nthe private sector for a well known and widely respected corporation. His current \nfinancial problems were caused by three factors beyond his control: (1) his divorce, (2) \nthe real estate downturn, and (3) intermittent, brief periods of unemployment. Ultimately, \nhe settled and paid, paid or otherwise resolved 14 of 21 SOR debts, and two debts are \nin current payment plans. He also resolved several other non-SOR debts. He made \ndramatic progress on debt resolution from January through April 2009. He documented \nexpenditures of $48,000 in January through April 2009 to resolve his delinquent debts. \n\n \n \n15 \n \nSeveral SOR debts were resolved earlier or were properly disputed. He is a patriotic \nU.S. citizen and I have no concern that he would jeopardize national security for \npecuniary gain.   \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial at this \ntime. Applicant has a long history of financial problems. His debts were discharged in \n1996 through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The significance of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy is \nlow because it is temporally remote, except to show his current financial problems are \nnot isolated. In 2007 to 2009, he generated about 20 delinquent SOR debts. He \nadmitted responsibility for 18 delinquent SOR debts. He failed to obtain financial \ncounselling. He received the SOR in October 2008, and did not establish significant \neffort to resolve his debts until January 2009. Although he showed excellent effort over \nthe last four or five months to resolve his delinquent debts, he could have acted more \naggressively to avoid delinquent debt, to seek debt repayment or resolution, and to \nbetter document his remedial efforts over the past two years. He failed to clearly and \nconvincingly explain how he raised $48,000 to satisfy his delinquent debts from January \nthrough April 2009. He failed to provide an updated personal financial statement. These \nfactors show some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. Applicant will have a \nsignificant tax debt because of his resolution of some of his debts without making full \npayment. For example, on April 2, 2009, he paid a creditor $5,000 to resolve a debt of \nabout $158,000. He will owe at least $50,000 federal taxes as a result of the release of \nliability for this second mortgage (the savings is about $153,000 and I assume his \nmarginal tax rate will be about 30%). This tax debt will be offset from the losses resulting \nfrom the decrease in value of his real estate investments. Most importantly, the five \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($224,000), 1.l ($21,000), 1.m ($28,000), 1.n ($69,000), and 1.o \n($17,000) were not sufficiently proven to be satisfactorily resolved. There was simply not \nenough documentary evidence for me to be confident that Applicant would not have \nfuture deficiency judgments issued on these five debts. Moreover, he is likely to have a \nsubstantial federal tax problem, assuming he does not repay these debts in full when \nthey are finally resolved.  Because \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information,\u201d I \nhave lingering doubts about Applicant\u2019s worthiness to hold a security clearance at this \ntime.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence to fully mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns at this time.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. \n\n \n \n16 \n \nFor the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information \nat this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.h: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j and 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l to 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p to 1.u: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 13, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about November 10, 2008, and requested a \nhearing.  DOHA assigned the case to me on December 5, 2008, and issued a Notice of \nHearing on January 7, 2009. The case was heard on January 27, 2009 as scheduled.  \nDepartment Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, called two character witnesses, and offered Exhibits (AE) A through \nH into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil February 13, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted four exhibits that were marked AE I through L, \nand admitted into the record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on February 4, 2009.           \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew Paragraph \n2, related to security concerns raised under the Personal Conduct guideline.

Her admissions are incorporated into the following findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and twice divorced. She has a 13-year old son from a first \nmarriage who resides with his father. She married her second husband in February \n2001 and separated in October 2002. They were divorced in March 2005. She \ngraduated from high school in 1985 and completed two years of business school after \nthat. From 1991 until February 2008, she had various low paying positions with law \nfirms, banks, insurance companies, and private companies. She was unemployed from \nJuly 2007 until February 2008, and from June 2005 until November 2005, for a total of \nabout 14 months. In February 2008, she started her present position as an armed \nsecurity officer with a defense contractor. (GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after she married her second husband in \n2001 and became responsible for all of their joint debts. (Tr. 41) During that time, she \nhad a surgical procedure that resulted in additional medical bills, not covered by \ninsurance. (Tr. 49) In May 2006, she hired a law firm to resolve her delinquent debts \nand avoid bankruptcy. (Tr. 88) However, she was unable to make many payments on \nthe debts or pay the law firm\u2019s monthly fee because she needed to move out-of-state \nquickly due to her former husband\u2019s criminal behavior in September 2006. She thinks \nshe made about four payments on two debts. (Tr. 63; 90; 92) \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant again retained the law firm to help with her financial \ndelinquencies and credit problems. On January 14, 2009, the firm began disputing \nsome of the debts listed on the SOR. (AE I & J) She recognizes that the firm has a high \nmonthly fee of $80, but feels that \u201cit is worth it because they are going to help me re-\nestablish my credit. But I am going to pay this. I have to pay them.\u201d (Tr. 102) She \nsincerely asserted, \u201cI just don\u2019t want this over my head any longer. It has been since I \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nseparated from my divorce, -- when I got divorced and it weighing heavy on me. I just \nwant to get these debts paid off.\u201d (Id.) Applicant sometimes works 14-hour days and has \nbeen unable to contact the bulk of the creditors because she does not have a computer \nat home and cannot use her employer\u2019s computer for personal matters. (Tr. 99)  On \nFebruary 12, 2009, she executed a Debt Settlement Agreement that includes four \ndelinquent debts, totaling $16,043. Payments on the agreement are set to begin in \nMarch 2009. The company will not handle outstanding medical or utility bills. (AE K & L) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR), dated April 2008 and August 2008, the \nSOR alleges 28 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $22,300, which started \naccumulating in September 2001 and continued into April 2008. (GE 2 & 3) The status \nof the debts is as follows: \n \n \nFour debts, previously disputed, are included in the debt settlement plan: \u00b6 1.b \nfor $3,177 (educational loans); \u00b6 1.j for $10,000 (a previous automobile repossession); \u00b6 \n1.k for $1,175 (credit card); and \u00b6 1.k for $709 (credit card). The amount of the monthly \npayment is not included in settlement plan, as the company is in the process of \nnegotiating a settlement amount for these four debts.    \n \n \nEight debts are being investigated and disputed: \u00b6 1.a for $459; \u00b6 1.c for $532 \nand \u00b6 1.x for $1,153 may be duplicates; \u00b6 1.d for $394 and \u00b6 1.q for $305 may be \nduplicates; \u00b6 1.g for $110, \u00b6 1.m for $104 and \u00b6 1.n for $113 may be duplicates. These \ntotal $3,170. (AE L) \n \n \nEight medical debts remain unresolved: \u00b6 1.e for $10; \u00b6 1.f for $369; \u00b6 1.h for \n$50; \u00b6 1.r for $66; \u00b6 1.s for $50; \u00b6 1.t for $122; \u00b6 1.u for $240; and \u00b6 1.v for $29. These \ntotal $936. \n \n \nFive utility debts remain unresolved: \u00b6 i. for $229; \u00b6 1.o for $206; \u00b6 1.w for $104; \nand \u00b6 1.bb for $104. These total $643. \n \n \nFour miscellaneous debts remain unresolved:  \u00b6 1.p for $1,341 (credit card); \u00b6 \n1.y for $66; \u00b6 1.z for $240; and \u00b6 1.aa for $850. These total $2,497. \n \n \nPrior to being placed on an administrative leave of absence pending the outcome \nof this proceeding, Applicant was earning a net amount of $2,000 a month. (Tr. 80; AE \nB) After paying her expenses and sending her son some money, she has very little \nmoney at the end of the month. She does not have any savings, nor does she use credit \ncards. (Tr. 83) The last time she had a credit card was in 2001. (Tr. 50) While she was \nliving with her fianc\u00e9e her financial situation was much better.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s supervisor, a senior site manager, testified. He has known Applicant \nsince January 2008. He considers her to be an \u201cexemplary employee.\u201d (Tr. 19) He is \naware of her financial problems. (Tr. 31) Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e testified.  They have been \nengaged for about three years, and known one another for about ten years. (Tr. 33).  \nShe has discussed her financial problems with him over the years and the steps she \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nhas taken to attempt to resolve them.  They do not live together now, but have in the \npast, and will in the future. (Tr. 38) Recently, they separated because their landlord\u2019s \nproperty went into foreclosure, requiring them to move quickly and causing them to \nspend around $3,500 in moving costs. (Tr. 87) He attributes many of her debts to her \nformer husband\u2019s failure to pay his share of expenses and criminal behavior. (Tr. 39) He \nhas a good position with a delivery company. \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation: one from her project \nmanager, three from co-workers who have military and law enforcement backgrounds, \nand one from a friend. All of the letters are very supportive of her efforts and comment \non her noteworthy work ethic, reliability and trustworthiness. (AE C, D, E, F, and G) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and maybe \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt in 2001 \nwhile married to her second husband and after their divorce. Those debts continue into \nthe present and are noted on two 2008 CBRs.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ntwo potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant=s delinquent debts arose in 2001 and continue into 2008. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply because they are current and have been ongoing for seven years. Some \nof Applicant\u2019s financial problems are attributable to her second husband and two \nperiods of unemployment, totaling 14 months. Those conditions were \u201cbeyond her \ncontrol.\u201d There is evidence that while accumulating the debts she sought to responsibly \nmanage her obligations with the assistance of a law firm, albeit such attempts were \nthwarted in 2006. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. In January 2009, she again \nemployed the law firm to resolve her delinquencies, and executed a debt consolidation \nplan in February 2009 to begin the resolution and repayment of four debts previously \ndisputed. Although there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the entire problem is \nunder control, there is some evidence that a large portion of the debt, $16,000 of \n$22,000,  is in the process of being resolved, warranting a limited application of AG \u00b6 \n20(c). She also executed a repayment agreement, evidencing some good-faith effort to \nresolve the debts, triggering a limited application of AG \u00b6 20(d). She produced evidence \nthat she recently disputed several debts, warranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(e), as to \nthose debts. \nThe record evidence does not support the application or AG \u00b6 20(f). \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a credible 42-year-old \nwoman, who has experienced significant personal problems since 2001 that have \ncontributed to her financial problems. In 2006, she employed a law firm to resolve the \naccumulating delinquent debts, but was unable to follow through with her agreement \nbecause of her former husband\u2019s criminal behavior, which required her to move. From \n2001 to February 2008, she was unemployed for over a year, exacerbating her financial \nproblems and substantially decreasing her income. Her supervisor is aware of her \nfinancial problems, which diminishes the opportunities for exploitation or coercion \nrelated to the delinquent debts. Both he and four colleagues are supportive and \nconsider her reliable and trustworthy, having worked with her since February 2008. \nWhile recognizing that she has not yet paid any of the debts listed in the SOR and has \nlimited funds to direct to their repayment because of her low salary, she is very \nconcerned about her finances and dedicated to resolving them and achieving financial \nstability. Other than these financial problems, there is no other derogatory information in \nthe record that challenges her ability to protect classified information. Her financial crisis \nappears to be more related to prior marital problems, inadequate employment and \nincome, rather than a lack of reliability or trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.bb:   For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n WITHDRAWN  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nOctober 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 2, 2009, Department \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing 15 Items, and he \nmailed Applicant a complete copy on July 6, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on \nJuly 10, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. Applicant timely submitted a document to which Department Counsel had \nno objection. On September 3, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me.

He was terminated from that position after being injured in \na car accident. He subsequently received a settlement from a lawsuit that he filed \nagainst the driver involved in the accident. (Item 4) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated February 2008, June 2008, and \nJanuary 2009, the SOR alleged five judgments totaling $13,765 that were filed against \nApplicant between 2007 and 2008. In his Answer, Applicant stated that all of the \njudgments were paid. During a March 2008 interview with an investigator, he produced \na document, dated October 2007, from the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a, indicating that \nthe judgment was filed in error. (Item 5 at 5). Applicant provided proof that the \njudgments for medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.f were paid from his \nsettlement. (AE 1) He indicated that he paid the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, SOR \u00b6 \n1. d, and SOR \u00b6 1.e through a garnishment, but did not provide proof of payment.1 In \nOctober 2005, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and in February 2006, the court \ndischarged $25,498 of his debt. He claimed that he accrued the debt after he lost his job \nin December 2004. (Item 4) \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he has a history of criminal convictions. He admitted the \neight misdemeanor convictions alleged in Paragraph 2 of the SOR: \n \n \n (1) In April 1999, he was found guilty of No Dog License, fined $25, and \nassessed $40 in court costs.  \n \n \n(2) In June 1999, he was found guilty of Bad Check, sentenced to six months in \njail (suspended), fined $50, and assessed $60 in costs. \n                                                          \n1These three judgments are owed to the same party for property damage that occurred when \nApplicant\u2019s car hit his neighbor\u2019s tree. (Item 4 at 27) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n (3) In July 1999, he was found guilty of Driving Under Influence (DUI), sentenced \nto 60 days in jail (suspended), fined $300, and assessed $60 in costs.  \n \n \n (4) On June 16, 2004, he was found guilty of Assault and Battery, fined $100, \nand assessed $60. \n \n \n  (5) On that day, he was also found guilty of Destruction of Property, sentenced \nto 30 days in jail (20 days suspended), and assessed costs of $90.00. These two \ncharges involved his wife.  \n \n \n  (6) On July 5, 2004, he was charged with Break and Enter (a felony). In October \n2004, he pleaded guilty to Trespassing (a misdemeanor), sentenced to six months in jail \n(suspended), placed on one-year supervised probation, and assessed $208 in costs. \nThis charge involved his wife.  \n \n \n(7) In December 2005, he was found guilty of No Driver\u2019s License, fined $75, and \nassessed $91 in costs.  \n \n \n(8) In July 2007, he was found guilty of Driving Under Revocation/Suspension (a \nmisdemeanor), was fined $100, and assessed $191 in costs.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he has been found guilty of 13 civil infractions since \n1998, as alleged in Paragraph 3 of the SOR: \n \n \n(1) In January 1998, he was found guilty of Speeding, fined $39, and assessed \n$40 in costs. \n \n \n(2) In June 1999, he was found guilty of Disregard Red Light, fined $50, and \nassessed $50 in costs. \n \n \n(3) In November 2002, he was found guilty of Disregard Highway Sign, fined $40, \nand assessed $57 in costs.  \n \n \n \n(4) In February 2004, he was found guilty of Speeding, fined $200, and assessed \n$75 in costs. \n \n \n(5) In July 2004, he was found guilty of Reckless Driving, fined $95, and \nassessed $67 in costs. \n \n \n(6) In February 2005, he was found guilty of Speeding, fined $60, and assessed \n$77 in costs. \n \n \n(7) In April 2005, he was found guilty of Speeding, fined $70, and assessed $77 \nin costs.  \n \n \n(8) In July 2005, he paid a $70 fine and $57 in costs for a speeding charge.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n(9) On December 5, 2005, he was found guilty of Expired Registration, fined $25, \nand assessed $10 in costs. \n \n \n(10) On that day, he also was found guilty of Speeding, fined $90, and assessed \n$10 in costs. \n \n \n(11) In October 2007, he was found guilty of No Inspection, fined $30, and \nassessed $82 in costs.  \n \n \n(12) In June 2008, he was found guilty of a HOV Violation, fined $75, and \nassessed $15 in costs. \n \n \n(13) In June 2008, he was found guilty of Tinted or Smoked Windshield, fined \n$75, and assessed $86 in costs. \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that \u201cI was involved in a bad \nrelationship/marriage and going through hard times in my life. I am not the same person \nI was. I have gotten out of my marriage and now have full custody of my daughter which \nhas changed my life completely.\u201d (Item 3 at 2) He indicated that his family and friends \nare aware of his history. (Item 5 at 14)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Based on three CBRs and his statements, Applicant had been \nunable or unwilling to satisfy, until recently, the judgments that accrued between 2007 \nand 2008. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter the government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that \ncould mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties, three of which may be \napplicable to this case:   \n\n \n6 \n \n \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose prior to 2006 when he filed a bankruptcy and \ncontinued into 2007 and 2008, when five judgments were entered against him. Because \nthe problems were ongoing and not isolated, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant filed \nbankruptcy after he was injured and lost his job in 2006. Those conditions were largely \nbeyond his control. However, there is no evidence that he attempted to responsibly \nmanage his debts while they were accruing, which is necessary evidence for full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant did not present any evidence that he received credit counseling and/or \nthat all of his financial problems are under control, as required under AG & 20(c). He \nsubmitted evidence that he resolved his early debts through a bankruptcy, paid two \nmedical judgments, and resolved another; hence, AG & 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, SOR \u00b6 1.f, and SOR \u00b6 1.g. He is paying the remaining three judgments \nthrough a garnishment, which cannot be construed to be his good-faith effort to repay or \nresolve debts. Hence, AG & 20(d) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.c, SOR \u00b6 1.d, and SOR \u00b6 \n1.e.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant admitted he was convicted of eight misdemeanors from April 1999 \nthrough July 2007. Both disqualifications were raised. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last conviction, for a DUI, occurred in July 2007. Given his eight-year \nhistory of criminal offenses, the passage of two years without a subsequent incident is \ninsufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 32(a). He stated in his Answer that he has \nchanged his life since he obtained sole custody of his child. That is some evidence of \nrehabilitation and warrants a limited application of AG \u00b6 32(d). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s multiple civil infractions over the past eight years demonstrate his \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and raise a question about his \nreliability and judgment under this guideline.   \nAG \u00b6 17 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct and civil infractions cannot be considered \nminor or infrequent, and casts doubt on his reliability and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) \ndoes not apply. Although he admits his past problems, he has not presented evidence \nthat he has participated in counseling or taken other steps to insure that similar \nproblems will not recur, as required under AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his \nwrongful conduct and has disclosed his history to his family and friends, which are steps \nthat may eliminate vulnerability to duress or exploitation, and warrant a limited \napplication of AG \u00b6 17(e). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who has a \nten-year history of multiple criminal and civil problems and financial issues. Although he \nappears to be maturing, he has not yet established a significant pattern of responsible \nconduct in several aspects of his life or provided significant evidence of permanent \nbehavioral changes. Until he does so, there is a strong likelihood that similar problems \nmay recur. This pattern of irresponsible behavior indicates that he may be irresponsible \nin the handling of classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from financial considerations, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.e:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He concealed this information from his family and\nprofessional associates, and omitted any mention of her on his application to upgrade\nhis clearance. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is revoked and denied. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 2,\n2006, while employed as a civilian Government employee.  On March 22, 2007, the Air\n1\nForce Central Adjudication Facility granted him a Secret clearance. On January 25,\n2008, after being hired by a Government contractor, he submitted his Electronic\nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), seeking to upgrade his clearance\nto Top Secret.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n3\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 13, 2009, and requested that\nhis case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.4\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 11, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n5\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non March 26, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. On April 19, 2009, he submitted a sworn\nletter with additional \u201cexplanations\u201d in response to the SOR allegations, but no other\nevidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation, and made no objection to consideration\nof any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. On April 23, 2009, Department\nCounsel initialed a memorandum to indicate that he objected to the admissibility into\nevidence of the materials submitted by Applicant. No basis for this objection was noted,\nand no further documentation was submitted to substantiate any reason for it.\nAccordingly, the objection is overruled and Applicant\u2019s April 19, 2009 letter is admitted\ninto evidence and the record. I received the case assignment on May 1, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married, with\nfour children, ages 25, 24, 21, and 15. He moved away from his family when he\nchanged jobs in February 2006, and has lived separately since then. He retired in 2005\nafter 24 years of enlisted service in the Air Force, and was granted a security clearance\nin 1995.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted the truth of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1d, 1.e,\n6\n1.f, and 1.h, was \u201cnot sure\u201d about \u00b6 1.b, and denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i.  He did not directly\n7\nrespond to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a or 3.a, but those two paragraphs incorporated allegations from\n\nItem 5.\n8\nItem 5 at 4-6.\n9\nItem 5 at 4-6, 8-9.\n10\n3\nSOR \u00b6 1, to which he admitted, by reference. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those\ncontained in his response to interrogatories,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n8\nApplicant\u2019s wife told him in 2001 or early 2002 that she had recently engaged in\nan extra-marital affair. From June to October 2002, he was assigned to perform\ntemporary duties (TDY) at an Air Force facility in Ecuador. While there he met a local\n23-year-old woman and began an intimate affair with her. She told him she had been a\nnursing student, but could no longer afford school after her father recently died so she\nwas working various unidentified jobs to support herself. Since 2002, he has returned to\nEcuador approximately twice a year. He explained to the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator that the purpose of these visits was to pursue and\ncontinue his affair with the Ecuadoran woman, for whom he continued to have strong\nfeelings,  although he attempted to downplay this motivation for his trips in his response\n9\nto the FORM, after being confronted with the security implications. He has sent the\nwoman payments of $100 per month and additional payments of $300 twice per year,\npurportedly to help her with nursing school expenses. He did not explain why she has\nnot completed school after more than seven years. He also purchased a lot of cell\nphones (about 15) on E-Bay in 2003, and sent them to her so she could resell them for\na profit. This was also purportedly to help her generate funds for school. Applicant\nexplained that all his contributions to her financial well being were gifts for which he\nexpected nothing in return that he made due to his generous nature. He also claimed\nthat his means of contacting her by telephone were stolen from him, but has never\ndisavowed his ongoing feelings for her, nor declared any intention to end the\nrelationship.\nApplicant told the OPM investigator, under oath on April 2, 2008, that the only\nperson except the Ecuadoran woman who knew of their affair was an Air Force friend\nwith whom he had been TDY at the time it began. He said he had met her mother,\nbrothers and sisters, but did not describe their understanding of the relationship. Neither\nthe woman nor any of her family members have any connection to the government of\nEcuador. He specifically said that he had not previously disclosed the affair to anyone\nexcept the friend, including his spouse. He affirmed the accuracy of these statements,\nagain under oath, on September 5, 2008.  Applicant responded to the SOR \u00b6 1.b\n10\nallegation that his spouse is unaware of the relationship by stating, \u201cNot sure I admit\n(she suspects).\u201d In his response to the FORM, he further explained that his brother and\nsister-in-law told him recently that his wife had told them that Applicant had told her\nabout the woman and she knew of his trips to Ecuador. He submitted no evidence to\ncorroborate this claim. He also admitted that he never told his Air Force supervisors\nabout the relationship nor did he disclose it during security debriefs after his visits,\nexplaining that he didn\u2019t think he was required to. He also failed to list her as an\nassociate on his 2006 and 2008 security clearance applications, although he did list his\n\nItem 4 at 26; Item 6 at 6.\n11\n4\n\u201cmany short trips\u201d to Ecuador from 2003 to present, for \u201cpleasure\u201d and \u201cto see different\naspects of the Country.\u201d11\nApplicant says he has consulted an attorney about obtaining a divorce, but is\nwaiting for his wife to move to the state where he resides to make the process easier.\nHe also said his wife wants a divorce, but keeps delaying her move. Accordingly, no\nactual progress has occurred in that matter. Applicant offered no other evidence\nconcerning his character, trustworthiness or responsibility. I was unable to evaluate his\ncredibility, demeanor or character in person since he elected to have his case decided\nwithout a hearing. \nApplicant made no objection to Department Counsel\u2019s request that I take\nadministrative notice of the facts set forth at pages 3 through 6 of the FORM, and\nsupported by exhibits I through V. Accordingly, administrative notice of those facts is\ntaken, and they are incorporated into these findings by reference. Of note, Ecuador is\nan ally of the U.S., with some corruption and human rights problems and issues with\nnarco-terrorists along the Columbian border, but no particularly heightened risk of\nespionage against U.S. interests based on the nature of the country itself vis-a-vis other\nforeign nations.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\n\n6\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\n(c) counterintelligence information, that may be classified, indicates that\nthe individual's access to protected information may involve unacceptable\nrisk to national security;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or\nexploitation;\n(f) failure to report, when required, association with a foreign national;\n(g) unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate,\nor employee of a foreign intelligence service;\n(h) indications that representatives or nationals from a foreign country are\nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(i) conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make\nthe individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country.\nApplicant admitted the truth of each of the factual allegations incorporated by\nreference in SOR \u00b6 2.a. These are his maintenance of an extramarital affair with a\ncitizen and resident of Ecuador from 2002 to at least September 2008, his biannual trips\nto Ecuador to visit her, his monthly and biannual payments to her totaling about $1,800\nper year since 2002, and purchasing the cell phones for her to resell. Department\nCounsel argues persuasively that these facts raise and support security concerns under\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (i) above. Having a secret mistress in any foreign country, with regular\nvisits to maintain the affair and regularly providing financial support, inherently involves\nboth contact with a resident national of a foreign country and conduct while visiting that\ncountry that create heightened risk of, and vulnerability to, exploitation, manipulation,\npressure and coercion. The ongoing and intentionally clandestine nature of the\nrelationship exacerbates such risk. Department Counsel\u2019s assertion of security\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 17(f), due to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the relationship as an\n\u201cassociate\u201d on his security clearance applications, is without merit since those\nomissions were not alleged as disqualifying information under this guideline in the SOR.\nNone of the remaining disqualifying conditions apply.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security\nconcerns:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation;\n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority;\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\n \nApplicant\u2019s admission of the foregoing facts supporting disqualifying security\nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 (a) and (i) shift the burden of proof to him to rebut, explain,\nextenuate or mitigate those facts sufficiently to establish that it is clearly in the interest\nof national security to grant him a security clearance. His subsequent, uncorroborated\nassertions seeking to minimize the nature and extent of his clandestine extramarital\naffair, conducted in a foreign country with a foreign citizen, and financial investment of\nboth direct payments and travel expenses is unpersuasive and falls short of meeting\nthis burden. The nature of this relationship does not make it unlikely that he would be\nput in a position of having to choose between the woman\u2019s interests and those of the\nU.S., regardless of the country involved. He proved nothing about Ecuador, his\nmistress, or her family that would lessen this risk. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply.  No conflict\nof interest scenario was alleged or asserted by Department Counsel, so AG \u00b6 8(b) is not\npertinent. Applicant\u2019s contact and communication with his Ecuadoran mistress has been\nregular, intimate, and ongoing for more than seven years, with no real evidence that it\nwill not continue. AG \u00b6 8(c) was not established. These foreign contacts were neither\n\n8\npart of Applicant\u2019s official duties, nor reported to appropriate authority, precluding any\nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d) or (e). Security concerns were not asserted under AG \u00b6 7\n(e), so AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply either. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under this guideline:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\n\n9\nAs discussed above, maintaining a long-term clandestine extramarital affair with\na foreign national subjects an individual to significant vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation or duress. Applicant\u2019s efforts to maintain the secrecy of this conduct\nhighlight his recognition of this problem, but he chose to continue the conduct due to his\nongoing strong feelings toward his mistress. The evidence supports security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 13(c). No other disqualifying condition was asserted by Department\nCounsel. \nApplicant\u2019s affair began when he was 41 years old. The behavior occurred\nregularly for some seven years, and he did not provide any convincing evidence that it\nis unlikely to continue, casting ongoing doubt on his trustworthiness and judgment. The\nbehavior remains unknown to important people in his life, providing a continuing basis\nfor coercion or exploitation whether it does, in fact, continue or not. The fact that the\nsexual behavior may have been private, consensual, and discreet does not mitigate\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 13(c). Accordingly, none of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\n14 are supported by this record.\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying under this guideline. Department Counsel asserts that three of them apply:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information; and\n\nItem 4 at 16.\n12\n10\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group.\nApplicant admits that he did not list his mistress as an \u201cassociate\u201d in response to\nthe questions asking him to list his \u201crelatives and associates\u201d on either his 2006 or his\n2008 security clearance applications. He explained that he didn\u2019t realize his mistress\nshould be revealed in response to this question. His 2006 SF 86 application does not\ncontain any definition of \u201cassociate,\u201d so his explanation for this omission is accepted.\nHowever, his 2008 e-QIP contains the instruction for \u201cAssociate\u201d to \u201cinclude only foreign\nnational associates with whom you or your spouse are bound by affection, obligation, or\nclose and continuing contact.\u201d  Applicant admitted that he was bound by affection to his\n12\nmistress at the time he completed this application, and continued to be so bound as late\nas September 2008. His assertion in response to the FORM that he did not consider her\nsignificant enough to list because their meetings were infrequent, casual, and easily\nseverable is inconsistent with his previous sworn statements describing their\nrelationship, and with the admitted facts concerning its nature and extent. Accordingly, I\nfind that he deliberately falsified material facts on his 2008 application by omitting any\nmention of her. As discussed above, his conduct in connection with this affair and his\nconcealment of information about it from family members and professional associates\ncreated significant vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation and duress. The evidence\nof record thus establishes security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and (e).\nMy whole person analysis will be set forth below, and will incorporate concerns\nunder all three alleged guidelines. Should my foregoing analysis finding significant\nunmitigated security concerns under both Guideline B and Guideline D be incorrect, I\nwould then find AG \u00b6 16(c) to be applicable on these facts. Despite his claim that his\nwife told him she had an extramarital affair before he began his, he persistently\nconcealed his conduct from her, his children and his supervisors. He knew it was\nwrongful, but could not resist the ongoing temptation to violate his family obligations. His\nadmitted conduct alone supports findings of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, and unwillingness to comply with rules. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n\n11\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\n \nApplicant did not reveal his affair until questioned by an OPM investigator about\nthe real motivations behind his \u201cmany short trips\u201d to Ecuador from 2003 to 2008 several\nmonths after omitting that information from his January 2008 e-QIP. He did reveal the\nnature and extent of his conduct during that interview after being confronted, and\nreaffirmed those statements in September 2008. He made no claim that he was advised\nhe need not reveal this information, and did not establish that either intimate relations\nwith his mistress or attempts to conceal the affair were unlikely to recur. He did not\ndemonstrate any positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation or\nmanipulation, and admitted the allegations on which all but the falsification concerns\nwere based. Accordingly, he failed to establish mitigation of personal conduct security\nconcerns under any AG \u00b6 17 provision.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n12\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his entirely voluntary choices and conduct that underlie security\nconcerns expressed in the SOR. He engaged in a clandestine extramarital affair with a\nforeign woman he met in 2002 while TDY that continued at least into late 2008. This\nincluded biannual visits for sexual liaisons as well as regular financial payments to her.\nHe provided no convincing evidence that this behavior has ended, or would end anytime\nsoon, or that he regrets having done so to the point that he would not repeat the\nbehavior. His motivation for the conduct was purely his personal gratification and to\nmaintain the affections of his mistress to that end. He did not disclose this activity to\nsignificant people in his life or on his most recent security clearance application, and\ncontinues to remain subject to duress should it be revealed. The record contains\ninsufficient other evidence about his character or responsibility to mitigate these\nconcerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence, sexual\nbehavior, and personal conduct considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is\nrevoked and denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 15 May 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  Applicant answered the SOR 7 July 2009, requesting a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 31 August 2009, and I convened a hearing 6\nOctober 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 14 October 2009.\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 31-year-old access control\nmanager employed by a defense contractor since September 2007. He seeks to retain\nthe clearance he obtained in December 2002.\nDecember 31, 2009\n\nThe amounts alleged in the SOR are the totals of the three outstanding mortgages, not all of which are\n2\ndelinquent. Nevertheless, the houses were foreclosed and Applicant lacks the means to satisfy the mortgages.\n2\nThe SOR alleges, government exhibits confirm, and Applicant admits, four\ndelinquent accounts totaling over $1.2 million.  Three accounts (SOR 1.b., 1.c., and\n2\n1.d.) are for first and second mortgages on two properties Applicant bought through an\ninvestment program that turned out to be a Ponzi scheme. The fourth account (SOR\n1.a.) is a $200 electric bill for one of the properties that Applicant has since paid. This\ndebt was incurred by tenants living in the property who were responsible for paying the\nelectric bill. He was unaware of this bill until the Ponzi scheme began to unravel.\nApplicant received his undergraduate degree in May 2002. He has been\nemployed by a series of defense contractors since September 2002, and obtained his\nfirst clearance in December 2002. He has never had a security violation or had his\nclearance suspended. He bought his own home in December 2005, and his first and\nsecond mortgages on this home have never been delinquent. His credit reports show\nthat the vast majority of his credit accounts are current or paid satisfactorily. His net\nmonthly income is approximately $4,400. He lives within his means.\nThe debts alleged in the SOR arose when Applicant was led into what he\nbelieved was a legitimate investment opportunity through more seasoned and\nexperienced colleagues at work and at his church. Applicant was raised to respect the\njudgment of his elders, and in this case the elders themselves believed the program\nwas a legitimate enterprise. Broadly described, the program involved Applicant (and\nothers) buying houses in his name with the assistance of the company, and then hiring\nthe company to manage the properties for five years\u2014at which point the properties\nwould conceivably be sold at a profit that Applicant and the company would share.\nApplicant bought two properties, in May and June 2007.\nThe program turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, the kind that generates news\nheadlines and criminal charges against the proponents. The scheme began to fall apart\nin August 2007, when state agencies acted to shut down the program and pursue\nsecurities violations and investment fraud charges against the program\u2019s principals. The\nassets of the company have been seized, but the \u201cinvestors\u201d are stuck with mortgages\non properties that they generally cannot pay.\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his two properties were foreclosed, and he has attempted\nwith varying degrees of success to work with the lenders and real estate agents to\nresolve the debts through short sales. The final disposition of the properties remains\nunsettled, but it is unlikely Applicant can pay any deficiency remaining after the\nproperties are sold. It is also unlikely that the creditors will pursue any deficiency. There\nis the possibility of individual suits or class action suits against the perpetrators.\nHowever, any recovery is unlikely to be enough to cover any remaining debt on the\nproperties.\n\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n3\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\njudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the whole-person factors listed in RAG \u00b6\n2(a). The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative for or against applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed where a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy\nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering\nthe SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F. On\npaper, Applicant owes an enormous amount of money that he cannot repay. However,\nthis inability, not unwillingness, to pay does not constitute a history of financial\nproblems.  Applicant\u2019s personal finances have been, and remain, solid. He was the\n3\nvictim of a Ponzi scheme that left him solely responsible for debts on two properties that\nhe never reasonably expected to bear. He entered the scheme on the recommendation\nof more seasoned and experienced colleagues, who themselves appear to have been\nvictimized by the scheme.\nApplicant satisfies important aspects of the mitigating factors for financial\nconcerns. While his financial difficulties were both recent and multiple, they were\nconfined to a relatively short period. They certainly occurred under circumstances not\n\n\u00b6 20.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur .\n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n6\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. For\n7\nthis factor to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-\nfaith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling his debt, which is present here as to the\nelectric bill.\n4\nlikely to recur.  The debts were largely due to circumstances beyond his control, but he\n4\nacted responsibly in addressing his debts. Under the circumstances of this case,\nkeeping his personal finances straight while the Ponzi-scheme-related properties are\nresolved is the responsible course of action.  Similarly, credit counseling is not an issue\n5\nin this case, his personal finances are under control, and the ultimate resolution of the\nPonzi-scheme-related properties is unlikely to effect his personal finances.  Finally, he\n6\npaid the one debt that was reasonably within his ability to pay, one he was not aware of\nuntil the scheme began to unravel.7\nThe disqualifying and mitigating factors under financial conditions do not really\ncontemplate the kind of financial circumstances Applicant found himself in. The real\nsecurity concern in this case boils down to a whole-person issue. Despite the size of the\ndebt, the circumstances surrounding it are such that there is no reasonable risk that\nApplicant would resort to illegal activity to obtain funds to pay it. I conclude Guideline F\nfor Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nKevin Barry McDermott, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 11, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 21, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jennifer I.\nGoldstein denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased and whether\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nConsistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge found that Applicant is an employee of a Defense contractor.  He is married and\nhas a 14 year-old daughter.  He has held a security clearance for 20 years.  \nApplicant, who began consuming alcohol at age 17, was arrested and charged with DUI in\nJanuary 2005.  He pled guilty to reckless driving and was given three years of probation.  He was\nrequired to enter into a first offender program and pay a fine.  \nAfter this incident, Applicant abstained from alcohol for two years.  However, he resumed\nhis consumption of alcohol.  From 1997 until 2007, excluding the two year abstention, Applicant\nwould become intoxicated two or three time a week and then operate his car.  He would often drink\noutside the home because his wife did not approve.  \nIn November 2007 he was again arrested for DUI.  Convicted, he was sentenced to 48\nmonths of probation, conditioned on participation in an 18-month alcohol recovery program, 49\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, and one day of confinement in the county jail.  He fulfilled\nthese requirements but was still on probation at the close of the record.  \nAlthough Applicant has also sought help through an assistance program provided by his\nemployer.  He attended a 15-week outpatient program, for a total of 125 hours.  Applicant no longer\nassociates with his drinking friends.  He has never had a sponsor in AA.  Although he completed the\nfirst three of the 12 recovery steps prescribed by AA, he was unable at the hearing to recall what\nthey were.  He was not able to identify the name of the book relied upon by AA.\nApplicant has promised to his wife that he will not drink again, he made a similar promise\nafter his 2005 arrest, yet, as stated above, returned to alcohol consumption.  He enjoys a good\nreputation at his work place.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant had returned to\nalcohol consumption in 2007 despite two years of abstinence following his first DUI and that he was\nstill on probation.  She noted favorable evidence, such as his completion of the alcohol treatment\nprograms referenced above.  However, she stated that she found Applicant\u2019s testimony that he is\ncommitted to sobriety to be lacking in credibility.  She gave as her reason for this conclusion: (1)\n\n1During Applicant\u2019s testimony, there was some apparent confusion as to the title of the AA handbook.\nApplicant stated that it was called the Blue Book.  However, during a brief recess, the court reporter advised that it was\nentitled the Big Book.  Tr. at 82.  The court reporter was not a witness and her statement was not evidence.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s inability to recall the first three AA steps; (2) evidence that he has no AA sponsor; and\n(3) evidence that he does not appear to be an active participant in AA.  \nShe also concluded that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony corroborating his claims of abstinence\nlacked credibility, in light of record evidence that Applicant had previously consumed alcohol away\nfrom her presence in order not to upset her.  Moreover, she stated that Applicant had been a mature\nadult during the times pertinent to his case, and that his admitted incidents of driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol were more numerous than the two occasions upon which he was arrested.\nAccordingly, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in his\ncase. \nDiscussion\nApplicant contends that the Judge was biased against him.  Specifically, he argues that the\nJudge divested herself of her impartiality by taking an active part in questioning him.  He also argues\nthat the Judge considered matters outside the record, specifically the name of the AA handbook.  He\nalso points to the Judge\u2019s statement that she was not convinced of his commitment to sobriety as\ndemonstrating bias against him. \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 08-\n01306 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).  We have examined the transcript and the Judge\u2019s decision.\nShe did question Applicant fairly extensively.  However, in a security clearance hearing, the Judge\nis the finder of fact and enjoys considerable latitude in clarifying the record.  A review of the\ntranscript shows that the Judge\u2019s questions in this case were relevant and temperate.  \nAdditionally, the Judge reasonably supported the challenged credibility determinations by\ncitations to record evidence, and we find no reason to disturb them.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1,\nwhich requires us to defer to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Even if the Judge erred by\nconsidering extra-record evidence concerning the title of the AA handbook, the error was harmless.1\nAll in all, we have found nothing that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the Judge\nlacked the requisite impartiality.  See ISCR Case No. 03-24632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006).\nApplicant\u2019s argument on appeal is not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the judge was\nunbiased.  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 11, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nG, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 26, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on August 26, 2010, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on September 24, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GEs) 1 through \n\n \n2 \n \n8, which were admitted without objection. The Applicant offered Exhibits (AEs) A \nthrough I without objection, called one witness, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 30, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.d. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is 47-years old and has been an employee of a defense contractor for \nthe past 25 years. He is married and has a 14-year-old daughter. He has possessed a \nsecurity clearance for 20 years. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; Tr. 37-39, 68-69.) \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at the age of 17, in approximately 1982. On \nJanuary 20, 2005, he was arrested and charged with Driving under the Influence of \nAlcohol, DUI with Blood Alcohol of 0.08% or Higher, and Wet Reckless. Applicant pled \nguilty to Wet Reckless and was placed on summary probation for three years. He was \nalso required to enroll in a three month first-offender program and pay a fine of $300. \nApplicant was 42-years old at the time of his first DUI. On this occasion, he had been \nout alone at a bar and grill for dinner. He consumed two to four margaritas with his \ndinner and then chose to drive home. After this arrest, Applicant abstained from alcohol \nuse for two years. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; GE 8; Tr. 38-40, 43-45.) \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant resumed his alcohol use. Applicant chose to resume drinking \nwith his friends after work and on the weekends. At first, he limited his alcohol \nconsumption to approximately four beers per week. However, his drinking increased. In \nfact, Applicant admitted, during his testimony, that from approximately 1997 to 2007 \n(with the exception of the two years after his 2005 DUI), Applicant would become \nintoxicated two-to-three-times per week with his friends and then drive approximately 30 \nmiles home. He often would consume alcohol outside of his home as his wife did not \napprove of his alcohol use. (Tr. 40-43, 44-45, 61, 71-72.) \n \n \nOn November 19, 2007, Applicant was again arrested and charged with Under \nthe Influence of Drugs/Alcohol and 08% More Weight Alcohol Drive Vehicle. He was \nfound guilty and sentenced to 48 months of unsupervised probation with the condition \nthat he attends an 18-month court ordered alcohol recovery program, 49 Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings, and serve one day in the county jail. Applicant presented \nevidence that he completed the court\u2019s requirements, but he did not provide any \ndocumentation to establish that his probation was terminated early. He is still on \nprobation for this offense. On the night of his arrest, Applicant had been out alone at a \nbar watching football games. He consumed approximately eight beers. He contends \nthat he did not feel drunk on this occasion and had a lot of water prior to driving. \nHowever, he reported his BAC was 0.13%. (GE 4; GE 5; GE 7; GE 8; AE A; AE B; AE \nC; Tr. 44-49.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn addition to completing the court ordered treatment, Applicant sought help \nthrough the employee assistance program offered by his employer. He was referred to \nan outpatient program. From November 2007 through March 2008, he attended a 15-\nweek out-patient course that consisted of group sessions. He received a certificate of \ncompletion after attending the required 125 hours. Applicant has also sought to better \nhimself through taking a three-month Dale Carnegie course. During the past three \nyears, Applicant has received his company\u2019s President\u2019s award and has been awarded \nthree U.S. \u201ctrade secrets.\u201d (GE 5; AE A; AE B, AE C; AE G; AE I; Tr. 35-36, 49-53.) \n \n \nApplicant claims that he has been sober since his last arrest in November 2007. \nHe testified that he continues to attend AA approximately two times per month. He \nindicated he no longer associates with his drinking friends. Applicant has never had a \nsponsor in AA. He asserts that he has completed the first three steps in the 12-step \nprogram; however, he was unable to recall what those steps were when asked on \nexamination. He referred to a printout of the steps for aide. Further, he was unable to \nidentify the name of the handbook relied upon in AA meetings during his testimony. (AE \nA; Tr. 53-55, 74-76.) \n \n \nApplicant denied ever being diagnosed with any type of alcohol dependency or \nalcohol abuse at hearing, although his physician had prescribed him Campral, a drug \nthat would help him abstain from alcohol. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that Applicant has not \nconsumed alcohol in almost three years and she believes her husband is committed to \nabstinence. However, she acknowledged that Applicant promised he would not drink \nalcohol again after his first alcohol related arrest in 2005. (GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 72, 75-90.) \n \n \nApplicant has the support of his manager and two colleagues. The letters of \nsupport indicate Applicant is well respected and a great co-worker. Each recommended \nApplicant for a security clearance. (AE D; AE E; AE F.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \n \nApplicant had two criminal convictions for driving after consuming alcohol, \nincluding his 2005 Wet Reckless and his 2007 DUI. These incidents brought to light \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of consuming alcohol to the point of intoxication and then driving \nhome several times per week from 1997 to 2005 and again in 2007. AG \u00b6 22 is \ndisqualifying. \n \nI have considered all of the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23 including:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant has failed to establish that any of the above mitigating conditions fully \napply to his case. Applicant was placed on probation in February 2008, for 48 months, \nand remains on probation for this offense, despite completing the court ordered \ntreatment. Further, he had a two year period of abstinence after his 2005 Wet Reckless \nconviction and subsequent first offender alcohol and drug education program, but \neventually returned to the consumption of alcohol, despite his promises to his wife. Not \nenough time has passed after Applicant\u2019s second alcohol related conviction to insure \nthat he won\u2019t resume his pattern of driving after becoming intoxicated after his probation \nis terminated. While Applicant has completed his court ordered treatment and outpatient \ntreatment program, I do not find his testimony regarding his commitment to overcome \nhis alcohol problem credible. His inability to recall the first three steps of AA, after \n\n \n6 \n \ntestifying that he had completed the first three steps, created doubts in my mind \nregarding the sincerity of his participation in that program. He has no sponsor and does \nnot appear to be an active participant in AA meetings. His wife\u2019s testimony on \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence was unconvincing, as Applicant had intentionally consumed \nalcohol outside his home in the past because he knew his drinking upset her. Overall, \nthe evidence does not support that he has mitigated the Alcohol Consumption concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nAfter considering all of the nine adjudicative factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a), I find that \nnone of the factors are clearly mitigating. While Applicant has a number of favorable \ncharacter references and has received some employment related awards, his alcohol \nconsumption is still of concern. He was a mature adult when he chose, two to three \ntimes per week, to drive after becoming intoxicated, over a long period of time extending \nfrom 1997 to 2005 and again in 2007. Only three years have passed since his last \nincident, and those three years are part of Applicant\u2019s probationary period for the court.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Alcohol Consumption security concerns. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance \nis denied. \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions, which he \nsigned on November 17, 2006. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n                                                          \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n March 9, 2010\n\nOn August 6, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guidelines E (Personal Conduct), D (Sexual Behavior), M (Use of Information \nTechnology Systems), and F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2  \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 12, 2009. He signed his notarized Answer \non August 24, 2009, in which he admitted the allegations under Guideline E, except for \nallegation 1.a(ii) and 1.b. He denied allegation 2.a. under Guideline D. Under Guideline \nM, he admitted allegation 3.a. He denied all the alleged debts listed under Guideline F. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 29, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on October 2, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October \n9, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November 10, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 exhibits, which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. The government also offered a \ndemonstrative exhibit, which I marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and \noffered eight exhibits, which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H.3 \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 19, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 46 years old, was an enlisted member of the U.S. Army from 1982 to \n1988. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1989, and a law \ndegree in 1994. He also married in 1994, and is the father of three sons aged 7, 9, and \n13 years. In 1995, in state A, he began operating a legal practice. Applicant worked for \na defense contractor from 1996 to June 2006, when he was terminated. In November \n2006, he moved to state B, where he obtained his current position with another defense \ncontractor as a test and certification engineer. He has held a security clearance since \n1982. (GE 1-5; Tr. 40, 161-162)  \n \nIn the early 1990s, Applicant started a property rental business in state A. At one \npoint, he owned more than 50 rental properties. He did not incorporate his business. His \nwife worked as the office manager. Starting in about the mid-1990s, he was \n                                                          \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President \non December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and \nthey apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant offered eight exhibits. However, several exhibits contained subparts. For administrative \nconvenience, the exhibits with subparts are identified as follows: AE B, parts (pt.) 1 through 28; AE C, \nparts 1 and 2; AE D, parts 1 and 2; AE E, parts 1 through 20; and AE F, parts 1 through 4. \n\nsimultaneously operating the rental business, holding a full-time position with a defense \ncontractor, and practicing law. Applicant traveled frequently for his job with the defense \ncontractor. He and his wife had marital problems. Although they attended marital \ncounseling in state A, they filed for divorce in 2004. Subsequently, in September 2005, \nhis employer moved Applicant and his family to state C. After the move, they withdrew \nthe divorce petition. In his current home state (B), he and his wife consulted a priest for \ncounseling, but Applicant testified that, \u201c\u2026pretty quick he said look, I'm just a \n[clergyman] and, you know, you need -- you guys need to go find a real counselor.\u201d \nApplicant provided a document dated October 2009 showing he has participated in \ncounseling since April 2008. He attends once or twice per week. The document does \nnot indicate that his wife attends. He testified that his current marital relationship is \n\u201cgrowing,\u201d (Tr. 164) but did not state his marital problems were resolved. (GE 6; AE C-\npt. 1; Tr. 40, 43, 81, 92-98, 213-214, 260)  \n \nWhen Applicant and his wife moved in 2005 to state C, they continued to have \nmarital problems. Applicant began to search social websites to determine if his wife was \nusing them. In January 2006, he paid to join an adult dating website to monitor her \nactivities. He discovered that she was accessing dating websites. He also began to \naccess internet sites with pornographic videos, both at work and at home. He viewed \npornographic material on the internet on his company computer. In January and \nFebruary 2006, he downloaded hundreds of pornographic videos to his work computer. \nHe viewed some of them while at work. He testified that he engaged in this activity \nbecause he felt angry and vengeful because of his wife\u2019s actions. Applicant's company \nhad a security system that flagged any access to denied (prohibited) internet sites. If the \nemployee\u2019s activities resulted in more than 100 such flags or \u201chits,\u201d the company \ninstalled software on the computer to monitor the employee\u2019s internet activity. In March \n2006, an investigation found that Applicant's computer has \u201c28,938 url requests and 482 \nA/D [access denied] hits.\u201d The company\u2019s investigator informed the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) agent that on average, Applicant accessed pornographic material \nfor 30-45 minutes per day at work, and that Applicant stopped engaging in this activity \nat work after February 2006, but continued using his company computer at home to \nview pornography, which was against the employer\u2019s policy. (GE 7; AE B-pt. 22; Tr. 95-\n101, 118, 120, 130-132, 231) \n \nApplicant testified that he did not use his work computer to download or view \npornographic material between February and May 2006. However, during a business \ntrip in May 2006, he used his company laptop to access an adult social site, and met a \nwoman4 in a chat room. They left the public room and went to a private chat room. They \ntalked, but had no visual contact. The next day, he purchased a camera and installed it, \nalong with the camera\u2019s software, on his company laptop. That night, he again met with \nthe woman and used the webcam. Applicant admitted in his SOR response that he \n                                                          \n4 Applicant denied during the hearing that he interacted with more than one woman during his online \nencounters. However, his handwritten note in his interrogatory response state, \u201cI also used my [company]  \nlaptop to login to the adult chat rooms and use Yahoo instant messenger, etc. and a webcam to have \nadult interaction with other women.\u201d (GE 6; Tr. 276-277). \n \n\nviewed live video of adults performing sex acts, and also transmitted live video of \nhimself, during which he exposed himself and masturbated. He testified that he did not \nshow his face during the live video transmission because he thought he might be \nrecognized and his actions would reflect badly on his company. He knew that accessing \nthe adult websites and installing the software were against company rules. He also \ntestified that, \u201cLoading computer software on there to do what I was doing was definitely \ninappropriate, extremely inappropriate.\u201d Applicant testified that his actions were selfish \nand immature, and resulted from his state of mind about his marital relationship. (AE B-\npt. 22; Tr. 101-105, 115, 126-127, 138-139, 156-160)   \n \nOn May 20, 2006, Applicant's company security officer confiscated his laptop and \ndiscovered the pornographic images and movies that he had downloaded, as well as his \nactions in the private chat room. A June 2006 Employee Corrective Action Memo \nreported that between January and May 2006, Applicant viewed numerous \ninappropriate and/or pornographic images from the internet; downloaded hundreds of \npornographic movie videos to his work computer; connected a personal web camera to \nhis work computer; joined a chat room on an adult social website; received live video of \nadults performing various sex acts; and \u201ctransmitted video of yourself exposing yourself \nwhile masturbating.\u201d (GE 7; Tr. 104)  \n \nApplicant denies the implication that this activity occurred continuously from \nJanuary to May 2006. He testified that it took place from mid-January to February 18, \n2006, and then not again until early May 2006. He also testified that it was not a daily \nactivity, but estimated that it occurred a few times per month. He did not deny the SOR \nallegation concerning his use of the webcam.5 In June 2006, the company found his \nconduct \u201cunacceptable as an employee and a manager. Due to the extremely serious \nnature of your actions, the violation of company policies and procedures and the \nrepetitious nature of your offenses, your employment with the [  ] company is being \nterminated, effective immediately.\u201d Applicant is not eligible for rehire. He reported in his \nsecurity interview that he is not susceptible to coercion based on his conduct because \nhis family and numerous people at the company are aware of his conduct. (GE 6, 7; AE \nB-pt. 5 and pt. 21; Tr. 105, 135-136, 238-240). \n \nWhile Applicant was working for the same defense contractor in 1997, his \ncoworkers complained that he was operating his rental property business during duty \nhours. Applicant denies the charge. The company investigated and coded the \n                                                          \n5 Applicant wrote a response in the Corrective Action Memo noting that the company had not accurately \nstated information about how he used the webcam. However, he did not ask that it be changed, because \nhe wanted to \u201csave the investigators any further activity in what I felt was a very disagreeable task\u201d and \nthat he would leave it to their discretion. He noted that it was a mistake not to correct it because \u201cIt has \nportrayed me as being involved in activities which I was not, and has played a pivotal role in my being \ndischarged.\u201d However, during the hearing, when Department Counsel asked about this comment, Appeal \nstated that what he denied was the security officer\u2019s statement that Appeal was attending counseling for \nhis sexual activities, when his counseling was marital in nature. The memo does not discuss Applicant's \ncounseling. However, the report of investigation could be interpreted in the way that Appeal describes, \nand it appears Appeal confused the Corrective Action Memo with the report of investigation. (GE 7; AE B-\npt. 21; Tr. 155-157). \n\ninvestigation as \u201cviolation of common sense business practices and unacceptable \nconduct.\u201d The defense contractor\u2019s report shows that the case was opened in \nNovember 1997 and closed in December 1997. It does not indicate that the charge was \nsubstantiated. The record evidence does not include a Corrective Action Memo or show \nthat any action was taken against Applicant (GE 7; AE B, part 5; Tr. 46-48, 238). \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes more than $500,000 in delinquent debt. \nThe debts comprise 1 medical debt; 12 credit card accounts amounting to $213,000, \nwhich Applicant used to cover operating expenses of his rental business (allegations \n4.b. through 4.l.); and 8 foreclosed mortgages on his rental properties amounting to \n$289,000 (allegations 4.m. through 4.t.). (GE 8-11; Tr. 87)  \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that two debts are paid. He paid allegation 4.a., \na medical debt of $80, on October 28, 2009. He also paid a judgment obtained by the \ncreditor in allegation 4.c. for a credit card debt in the amount of $6,286 on October 27, \n2009. Applicant also testified that he paid the credit card debt of $14,328 alleged at 4.h., \nbut the account number Applicant cites does not match the account number alleged at \nSOR subparagraph 4.h. The remaining credit card debts, which became delinquent in \n2003 and 2004, are unpaid. Applicant testified that he was willing to pay his credit card \nobligations, and made efforts to settle, but could not reach settlement agreements with \nmost of the creditors. He provided no documentation to substantiate his efforts to settle \nwith the companies. In January 2006, he ended his own efforts and delegated to his \nattorney the responsibility for any further contacts, with instructions to let the creditors \nmake contact if they were interested in settling the accounts. When asked about his \nattorney\u2019s contacts with the creditors, he testified, \u201cI know that he -- he responds to calls \nand if he sees somebody that is doing something, he offers payment, but we -- I mean \nwe went over and over extending.  I mean they know how to get a hold of us and how -- \nand that we want to settle.  I mean you can't \u2013.\u201c (GE 8; AE E-pt. 2, pt. 3, and pt. 14, AE \nG; Tr. 85-88, 169) \n \nApplicant testified that his credit card accounts are resolved. He relies on the \nstate A statute of limitations, under which such unpaid debts are no longer legally \nenforceable after three years.6 He states that he was not liable after October 2007. \nAlthough he denies that he owes any of these debts, he has not contacted the credit \nreporting agencies to dispute the fact that the debts continue to appear on his credit \nbureau reports. (AE C-pt. 2, AE D, AE E-pt. 14; Tr. 192, 229) \n \nFor approximately ten years, Applicant operated his rental business without \nfinancial problems. The rental market in state A began to change in about 2001 when \nApplicant found that his tenants, who would not have qualified financially in the past, \nwere able to secure home loans and pay less in mortgage payments than in rent. \n                                                          \n6 Appeal cites 12 [state code] 2001 Ss 95 A(2). The statute states, in pertinent part, \u201cA. Civil actions other \nthan for the recovery of real property can only be brought within the following periods, after the cause of \naction shall have accrued, and not afterwards: \u20262. Within three (3) years: An action upon a contract \nexpress or implied not in writing;\u201d \n \n\nApplicant began to sell his properties. He held a large auction in 2003 and sold \nnumerous units. He held a second auction in early 2004, and sold several more \nproperties. He contacted lenders to offer \u201cshort sales\u201d or a deed in lieu of foreclosure, \nbut his offers were not accepted. He was able to sell more than half of his properties, \nbut approximately 20 properties remained unsold. He was unable to carry the mortgage \npayments, which totaled about $8,000 per month. Several of the lenders who did not \nagree to Applicant's offers took possession of the properties. Eight of these foreclosed \nmortgages are listed in the SOR at paragraphs 4.m. through 4.t. (AE B-pt. 23, AE C-pt. \n1; AE E-pt. 13; Tr. 61) \n \nApplicant testified that, under controlling state A law,7 the lenders are not entitled \nto payment of the deficiency balance on these mortgage loans because they took \npossession of the properties. Applicant also provided ten 1099-A forms (Acquisition or \nAbandonment of Secured Property) forwarded by the creditors to the U.S. Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). Four of the submitted 1099-A forms relate to allegations 4.m., \n4.n., 4.p, and 4.q. The remaining 1099-A forms do not relate to properties listed in the \nSOR. (AE E-pt. 13, AE H; Tr. 203, 206) \n \n \nWith funds from the sale of two houses in state C, Applicant bought his current \nhouse in state B in 2007. He paid cash because he could not obtain a mortgage loan \nwith his poor credit rating. However, he contends that he is now in good financial shape. \nHe testified that the only loan he owes is one to his mother, who gave him $70,000 in \n2002 to help with his failing rental business. Applicant's net take-home pay of \napproximately $4,000 per month, along with his wife\u2019s net income of about $800 \nprovides a joint net monthly income of $4,800. He estimated at the hearing that his \nmonthly expenses were $2,000. Although these figures result in an approximate \nmonthly remainder of $2,800, Applicant stated that he does not have that much left \neach month. However, he did not know what additional expenses might account for the \ndifference. (Tr. 193, 222-228) \n \n \nApplicant provided performance evaluations for 2007 through 2009 that described \nhis performance as exceeding expectations in most of the numerous categories rated. \nHe has led projects to completion with all goals achieved. A friend who was a coworker \nwhile Applicant worked at the company where he was terminated provided a reference \nletter stating that Applicant was ethical, provided excellent support, and is committed to \nthe defense of the United States. His lead engineer at the same company was unaware \nthat Applicant engaged in activities that raised security concerns, but attested to his \ntrustworthiness in handling classified material. His engineering manager at the same \ncompany stated that he never saw any questionable conduct and found Applicant to be \nprofessional and ethical. (AE B-pt. 27, AE C-pt. 1)  \n \n \nApplicant also submitted a letter from a pastoral counselor, dated October 2009, \nattesting that Applicant participated in counseling from April 2008 to October 2009 \nfocusing on personal growth and healthier interactional dynamics and communication \n                                                          \n7 Applicant cited 12 [state code] Sect. 2002 (2004); 12 [state code] Sect. 686; Mare Oil v Deep Blue, 65 P. \n3d 294 (2002). \n\npatterns. He recommends that Applicant continue with the therapy sessions. Applicant \nalso submitted a letter from a bank loan officer stating that Applicant had obtained loans \nin 1999, 2000, and 2004 amounting to approximately $583,500, and that each of the \nnotes was paid in full as agreed, with no delinquencies. (AE C-pt. 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the criteria in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).8 The \npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not determine a \nconclusion for or against an applicant. Instead, the Guidelines are applied along with an \nevaluation of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b62(a) of the Guidelines.  \n \nA security clearance decision resolves only the question of whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest9 for an applicant to receive access to classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d10 A decision \nto deny a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant; it is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the \nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nThe government bears the burden of producing admissible information to support \nits decision to deny or revoke a security clearance. The government must also prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, then the \napplicant must refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. As no one has a \n\u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A \nperson granted access has a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust \nand confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national \ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under Guideline D: \n \n                                                          \n8  Directive, 6.3 \n \n9  See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) \n \n10  See, Executive Order 10865, Sect. 7 \n\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 includes the following relevant conditions that raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying: \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to  coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of  discretion \nor judgment. \n \n \nApplicant was vulnerable to coercion based on his sexual misconduct. When he \nengaged in this activity, Applicant\u2019s supervisor and coworkers were unaware of his \ndownloading and viewing pornography from the internet. He was involved in serious \nmisconduct that could result in termination. Other people only became aware after it \nwas discovered through his company\u2019s security measures. Between January and May \n2006, before the company detected his activities, Applicant's actions made him \nvulnerable to exploitation.11 AG \u00b613(c) applies. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b613(d) also \napplies. Applicant downloaded hundreds of pornographic videos to his work computer, \nand viewed some of them during his duty hours. He engaged in graphic sexual \ndiscussions and activities with a stranger on the internet, during which he exposed \nhimself on camera. His conduct showed a complete lack of discretion and judgment. \n \nUnder Guideline D, AG \u00b614 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s sexual misconduct in 2006 is not recent, I cannot \nconfidently conclude that he will not resort to inappropriate conduct when subjected to \nstress in the future. His behavior resulted from marriage problems; Applicant testified \nthat his marriage is \u201cgrowing,\u201d but did not testify that it no longer causes stress. In \n                                                          \n11 See, ISCR Case No. 91-0259 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1992). \n\naddition, Applicant knowingly and repeatedly violated his employer\u2019s policies, even \nthough he held a security clearance, conduct that casts serious doubt on his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. However, AG \u00b6 \n14(c) does apply. Applicant is no longer subject to exploitation based on this sexual \nmisconduct, as his family, supervisor, and some coworkers are aware of his activities. \nAs to AG \u00b6 14(d), Applicant's behavior was not private, as he accessed pornography \nfrom his company computer, which was monitored by his employer. He also participated \nin adult social websites where he discussed sexual matters and engaged in sexual \nactivity with strangers, behavior that is neither private nor discreet. AG \u00b6 14 (d) cannot \nbe applied. In light of the lack of mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) and (d), the mitigation \navailable under AG \u00b6 14(c) is insufficient to find for Applicant on Guideline D.  \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \nAG \u00b6 40 includes the following relevant disqualifying conditions: \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem; and  \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations. \n \nApplicant used his employer\u2019s computer in an unauthorized manner to access \npornography both at his job during duty hours and while on a company business trip. He \nalso installed unauthorized hardware and software \u2013 the webcam and its associated \nsoftware -- on his company computer to enhance his participation in prohibited sexual \nactivity on adult websites. Both AG \u00b6 40(e) and (f) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides two relevant mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor. \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 41(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s actions did not occur under \nunusual circumstances but at his work place, during the workday, and on a business \ntrip. Even though it happened several years ago, the fact he indulged in such behavior \nwhen he was a mature adult casts serious doubt on his good judgment. AG \u00b6 41(c) also \ncannot be applied. Applicant\u2019s conduct was intentional. It was discovered not through \nhis own admission, but only because his company installed detection software after his \nexcessive use of denied internet sites. Applicant's misuse of his company\u2019s information \ntechnology systems is unmitigated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe facts support application of two disqualifying conditions under AG 16:  \n  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing,\u2026; \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s viewing of adult pornography on his work computer demonstrates a \nwillingness to disregard his company\u2019s policies. Moreover, the fact that he engaged in \nsuch activities while he held a security clearance underscores his willingness to ignore \nthe trust that the government placed in him when he was granted a security clearance. \n\nApplicant\u2019s untrustworthy conduct demonstrated a lack of judgment that is incompatible \nin those who are entrusted with classified information. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant denies the SOR allegation that he operated his rental business from his \ndefense contractor worksite. The company\u2019s report shows only the date the \ninvestigation was opened and closed and its code. It does not show that Applicant was \nadmonished or suffered any disciplinary action. Therefore, the evidence does not \nsupport a conclusion that Applicant's employer found him to be misusing company time \nor resources for his rental business, and no mitigation is required as to the conduct \nalleged at subparagraph 1.b. \n \n \nConcerning the possibility of coercion, disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) \napplies because, until Applicant's sexual activities were detected by his employer, they \nwere unknown to his coworkers and supervisor. Applicant\u2019s personal and community \nstanding would certainly have been affected by discovery of his conduct, as \ndemonstrated by the fact that once his activities were discovered, Applicant was \nterminated. During the period that he engaged in these acts, and while they were \nunknown to his employer, Applicant was vulnerable to exploitation.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions are relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual conduct is unmitigated by AG \u00b6 17(c). Although his conduct \nwas not recent, it was serious, untrustworthy, and demonstrated extremely poor \njudgment. AG \u00b6 17(d) has limited applicability: Applicant attends therapy, but he did not \ntestify that the marriage problems that caused negative conduct in the past no longer \nexist. The evidence does not show that the therapy is marital in nature, or that his wife \nattends. Questions remain whether marital stresses continue, and whether they might \ncause negative conduct in the future. As to vulnerability, AG \u00b6 17(e) requires that an \napplicant take steps to eliminate vulnerability to coercion. Here, Applicant took no steps \nto inform his employer of his actions and thereby eliminate his vulnerability; His \nemployer only learned of Applicant's compromising conduct when the security \nmeasures exposed him. AG \u00b6 17(e) does not apply. Applicant's sexual misconduct is \nunmitigated under Guideline E. \n\n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). In the mid-2000s, after he sold most of his rental properties, \nApplicant was unable to meet the mortgage payments on the remaining units and they \nwere foreclosed. Applicant had delinquent credit card accounts associated with his \nfailed business. He made efforts to settle with the creditors, but could not reach \nsettlement agreements on many of them. In January 2006, he stopped any further \nefforts and delegated to his attorney the responsibility for any further contacts, with \ninstructions to let the creditors contact him if they were interested in settling the \naccounts.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nIt is unlikely that he will be involved in such ventures in the future because he \nno longer operates a real estate business, which was the source of his excessive debt. \nHowever, his debts are numerous\u2014the SOR cites 20 debts\u2014and total approximately \n\n$500,000. Moreover, Applicant's decision to end his efforts in 2006 to pay his credit card \ndebts raises concerns that he was simply waiting for the statute of limitations to render \nthe debts legally unenforceable the following year. His conduct casts doubt on his \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe circumstances that resulted in the foreclosures and the associated credit \ncard debts were largely beyond Applicant's control. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose \nfrom the unforeseeable market changes that caused him to lose renters. Applicant \nmade substantial and reasonable efforts to resolve his mortgage delinquencies by \nholding real estate auctions in 2003 and 2004, and offering the lenders short sales or \ndeeds in lieu of foreclosure. The lenders listed in the SOR recovered the properties, and \nunder state law, cannot claim deficiency balances on these debts.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he made efforts to arrange settlements with the credit \ncard companies. However, in January 2006, he instructed his attorney to discuss \nsettlement only if a creditor called. It appears that Applicant was simply waiting until the \nstatute of limitations rendered the debts legally unenforceable in 2007. Under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, this does not constitute a good-faith effort, and AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply.12 Although Applicant receives some mitigation based on AG \u00b6 \n20(b), it is insufficient to outweigh the disqualifying conditions under Guideline F.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \n                                                          \n12 The Appeal Board has held that reliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not necessarily \nrepresent a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d under AG \u00b6 20(d). See, ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, \n2009); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. \nJul 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008). \n\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nBetween January and February 2006, Applicant used his employer\u2019s computer to \naccess and download hundreds of pornographic videos while at work. He also viewed \nsome of them during duty hours. In May 2006, he viewed pornographic material on his \ncompany laptop while on a business trip. On the same trip, he installed a camera and \ncamera software on the laptop, and viewed live pornographic videos. He transmitted live \nvideo of himself masturbating to an adult website. Applicant did not disclose his actions, \nand was terminated when his employer detected these activities. Applicant's sexual \nmisconduct occurred when he was a mature adult 42 years old, married, and the father \nof three sons. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant's conduct occurred four years ago, the nature of his acts \nraises serious concerns. Each time he accessed a pornographic site at work, he \nknowingly violated company policy, and placed his own interests foremost. He also \nbetrayed the trust the government had placed in him as a holder of a security clearance. \nHis actions made him vulnerable to exploitation for the period when his employer was \nunaware of his activities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s rental business suffered when the real estate market in state A \nchanged. He made substantial efforts to sell his properties. The deficiency balances on \nhis foreclosures are no longer owed under state law. However, Applicant ended his \nefforts to resolve more than $200,000 in credit card debt in 2006, and waited until the \nstatute of limitations rendered the debts unenforceable the following year. The Appeal \nBoard has held that such reliance on a statute of limitations does not constitute a good-\nfaith effort to resolve debt. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a. \n \n \n \n \nFOR Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 4.b. \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 4.c. \n \n \n \n \nFOR Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 4.d. \u2013 4.l \n \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 4.m. \u2013 4.t.  \n \n \nFOR Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in Paragraphs 1.a and 1.b. Applicant is 54 years old. He and his wife have been married for 30 years. They have two adult children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree in business administration, and a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. From June 1977 until October 1997, he served as an officer in the Naval Reserve. Since March 1979, he has held a Secret clearance and at times a Top Secret clearance. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since September 1987. He is a principal engineer for the company. (Item 3; Statement) In June 2006, Applicant started a franchise for personal training. He obtained a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan through Bank 1 and another loan through Bank 2. He secured both loans with mortgages on his home. In early 2007, the business began experiencing financial problems, as a result of a decrease in the number of clients and inclement weather. He continued to lose money over the next several months. In July 2007, he closed the business to prevent the accumulation of additional debt.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nOn November 13, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (eQIP). On May 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nOctober 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On July 8, 2009, Department \nCounsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine Items and he \nmailed Applicant a complete copy on July 14, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on \nJuly 21, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. On August 17, 2009, Applicant submitted a Statement with five exhibits to \nwhich Department Counsel had no objection. On September 3, 2009, DOHA assigned \nthe case to me. After receiving the file, I marked Applicant\u2019s exhibits as AE 1 through 5 \nand entered them into the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nParagraphs 1.a and 1.b.   \n  \n \nApplicant is 54 years old. He and his wife have been married for 30 years. They \nhave two adult children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration, and a master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. From June 1977 until \nOctober 1997, he served as an officer in the Naval Reserve. Since March 1979, he has \nheld a Secret clearance and at times a Top Secret clearance. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor, since September 1987. He is a principal \nengineer for the company. (Item 3; Statement) \n \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant started a franchise for personal training. He obtained a \nSmall Business Administration (SBA) loan through Bank 1 and another loan through \nBank 2. He secured both loans with mortgages on his home. In early 2007, the business \nbegan experiencing financial problems, as a result of a decrease in the number of \nclients and inclement weather. He continued to lose money over the next several \nmonths. In July 2007, he closed the business to prevent the accumulation of additional \ndebt. (Statement) He subsequently sold his assets to pay some of the business debt.  \n \n \nOn August 23, 2007, Applicant met with a bankruptcy attorney to discuss the \nbusiness closure and financial issues. By the end of 2007, the lawyer began negotiating \na resolution of the SBA loan. The parties were unable to reach an agreement with the \nSBA and Bank 1 over the next several months. In late 2008, the lawyer advised \nApplicant to file a debt adjustment proceeding under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. \n(AE 4) On March 27, 2009, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 Voluntary Petition. According to \nthe Petition, Applicant\u2019s assets total $290,325 and his liabilities total $503,778. (Item 8) \nIn his August 11, 2009 letter, Applicant\u2019s lawyer states as follows:   \n \n \nWe have agreed with the Chapter 13 Trustee on the debtor\u2019s plan. We will \npresent an amended plan which may still be contested by SBA. Any delay \nin confirmation is a consequence of continuing technical legal issues and \nnot [Applicant\u2019s] performance under the plan which has been perfect in \nterms of both cooperation and payment. (AE 4) \n   \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nUnder the Trustee\u2019s plan, Applicant is making monthly payments of $1,900. He \nbegan making those payments in April 2009, one month after he filed for bankruptcy. \n(AE 2) That plan may change as he continues to negotiate issues with the SBA and \nBank 1. (Statement at 3) In addition to making that payment, he continues to make \nmonthly payments to other creditors. He consistently pays the first mortgage on his \nhome. As of June 2009, the balance was $105,066. (AE 3) His student loan is current \nand has a balance of $62,457 as of June 2009. (AE 3) In his October 2008 Personal \nFinance Statement (PFS), he included the mortgage and student loan as two debts he \nwas paying. He noted that he was negotiating a payment for the SBA loan. (Item 5) \nAccording to that PFS, his net monthly income was $5,560. His monthly expenses were \n$2,470 and his debts were $1,890, leaving him $1,200 remaining. (Id.) Applicant did not \nexperience financial difficulties until he started his business. (Statement at 2) A credit \nbureau report dated November 2007 verifies his assertion.   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged two security concerns. The status of those concerns is as \nfollows: \n \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a referenced a judgment for $2,138 owed to a credit card company. \nThat debt is included in the bankruptcy. (Item 8 at 28)  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that when Applicant filed a March 2009 Voluntary Petition \nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy he had $290,325 in total assets, $503,779 in \nliabilities, and as of April 2009 no bankruptcy plan had been confirmed. \nAccording to the Docket Text of the Bankruptcy Petition, Applicant filed a \nChapter 13 Plan and Certificate of Credit Counseling the same day he filed \nthe Petition. (Item 8) \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant is resolving his debts through a bankruptcy and is paying \nother creditors directly.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations are \nset out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG & 19(a) sets forth a condition that could raise a security concern and be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d After \nApplicant\u2019s business failed in 2007, Applicant accumulated a significant amount of debt \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthat he was unable to satisfy or manage until he filed a bankruptcy petition in March \n2009. The evidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition.  \n \nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concern. AG \u00b6 20 \nincludes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties, four of which may be applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and, \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant started a business that began to fail in December 2006. \nIn July 2007, he closed the business to prevent the accumulation of additional debt. A \nmonth later, he sought legal assistance and sold some of his assets to pay debts. This \nunusual situation is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability. \nHence, AG \u00b6 20(a) has some application. The circumstances leading to the business \nfailure, a diminished client population and inclement weather, were conditions beyond \nhis control. Within one month of closing the business, he sought legal assistance, a \nresponsible action. Over the course of the next year, his lawyer attempted to negotiate a \nresolution of some of his debts before filing bankruptcy. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable. \nPrior to filing the bankruptcy petition, he completed credit counseling. He has made \nmonthly payments to the bankruptcy trustee in accordance with a plan submitted at the \ntime of the bankruptcy in March 2009. Those actions warrant a partial application of AG \n& 20(c) because they indicate that his situation is being resolved. In addition to paying \nthe trustee, he continues to pay creditors outside of the bankruptcy, further \ndemonstrating a good-faith effort to resolve his financial responsibilities, and triggering \nthe application of AG & 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 54-year-old man, who \nhonorably served in the U.S. Navy for twenty years. In 2007, he encountered a \nsignificant financial setback when his business franchise failed. He promptly sought help \nfrom a lawyer and has complied with a repayment plan filed with the bankruptcy court. \nPrior to filing a bankruptcy petition, his lawyer attempted to resolve some of the issues \nthrough negotiations. Based on Applicant\u2019s awareness of the effect that future financial \nproblems could have on his employment, I believe that similar problems will not recur \nand that he will make payments to the bankruptcy trustee as agreed. There is no other \nadverse information in the record that raises a security concern. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions and concerns as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nJanuary 24, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline E. DOHA acted under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense (DOD) on \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 18, 2010; answered it on January 29, \n2010; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nwas ready to proceed on February 3, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 19, 2010.  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR on April 6, 2010, adding one allegation \nunder Guideline K that cross-alleged the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.h, 1.k, and 1.l under Guideline E. Applicant responded to the amended SOR on April \n14, 2010, and he denied the Guideline K allegations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel requested that the hearing not be scheduled until late April \n2010 due to the complexity of the case and number of senior-level witnesses. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on March 15, 2010, scheduling the hearing for May 4, 2010.  \n \nOn April 26, 2010, I convened a prehearing conference at the request of both \nsides. There was no court reporter present. The purpose of the hearing was to mark and \nexchange documents; discuss scheduling; receive written objections and motions; and \ndiscuss administrative and logistical matters related to the hearing of this case. My \nPrehearing Conference Guidance was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I and attached \nto the record. There was no discussion of the merits of any of the motions and no \nrulings. Department Counsel requested additional time to respond to the Applicant\u2019s \nmotions, and we agreed that Department Counsel would be given until close of \nbusiness on Monday, May 17, 2010, to file any responses. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on May 4, 2010. Subsequent hearing \nsessions were convened on May 5, 25, 26, and 27, and June 30, 2010. Department \nCounsel presented the testimony of three witnesses and submitted Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 47. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of 14 witnesses \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) 1 through 169. Objections to exhibits and my \nrulings are discussed below. Two additional witnesses testified at my direction.  \n \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX 170 through 174. AX 171 and 173 were \nadmitted without objection. AX 172 and 174 were admitted over Department Counsel\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n \n \nobjection. I granted the requests of parties for an opportunity to submit written closing \nstatements, and they were timely submitted. They are attached to the record as HX \nLXVI and LXVII. Oral closing statements were scheduled for June 16, 2010, but \npostponed until June 30, 2010, at Applicant\u2019s request. Both sides presented oral closing \nstatements on June 30, 2010. I granted the requests of both parties to submit written \nreply briefs after the hearing adjourned. Applicant submitted a reply brief on July 2, \n2010, and it is marked as HX LXVIII. DOHA received the transcript on July 30, 2010.1  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nMotion to Clarify SOR \n \n \nApplicant moved to compel clarification of the SOR, complaining that Department \nCounsel has \u201crefused to provide any link between any paragraph of the SOR and any \nparticular document.\u201d (HX IV.) I denied the motion to provide the specific links requested \nby Applicant, but ordered Department Counsel to provide greater specificity for the \ndates alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h. Applicant later renewed his earlier \nmotion, specifically contending that Department Counsel had refused to clarify the \npurpose for which GX 40 and 41 were being offered. I again denied the motion. (HX \nXLVII.) \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.3 requires that the SOR be \u201cas detailed and comprehensive as \nnational security permits.\u201d The requirement of specificity pertains to the allegations, not \nto the evidence proving the allegations. See ISCR Case No. 02-05665 (App. Bd. May 7, \n2003.) There is no requirement that Department Counsel disclose the specific links he \nor she intends to show between each item of evidence and each allegation. Thus, I \nordered Department Counsel to be more specific about the dates of the alleged \nconduct, but I declined to require that he outline the evidence he intended to present in \nsupport of each allegation. \n \nMotion to Compel Production of Complete and Unredacted Documents \n \n \nApplicant moved to compel Department Counsel to produce complete and \nunredacted copies of GX 13, 14, 24, 27-31, and 39-41. All the documents had been \nobtained from another government agency and redacted to remove protected \ninformation. Applicant had obtained more complete copies of some documents by \nrequesting them under the Privacy Act.  \n \n                                                          \n1 The transcript consists of a separate numbered volume for each hearing day. Each volume is identified \nby the month and day followed by the specific page reference. Thus, the reference to the last page of the \ntranscript for the hearing day on May 4, 2020 is Tr. 5/4 at 416. There are two versions of the transcript for \nthe final hearing day, June 30, 2010. The first version was received on July 27, 2010. The second version \n(Tr. 6/30), revised after review by Applicant\u2019s counsel, was received on July 30, 2010. The second \nversion was used for this decision. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nDiscovery by an applicant is limited to non-privileged documents and materials \nsubject to control by DOHA. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.11. Department Counsel and Applicant are \nrequired to serve one another with a copy of any document to be submitted at the \nhearing. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.13. There is no requirement that Department Counsel provide \nApplicant with documents that he or she does not intend to offer in evidence. \nFurthermore, Applicant is only entitled to see what Department Counsel intends to \nsubmit; he is not entitled to compel Department Counsel to search for evidence that \nApplicant wishes to submit. Accordingly, I denied Applicant\u2019s motion. (HX XLII.) \n \nMotion for Expedited Consideration of Security Issues \n \n \nApplicant alleged that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j, 1.k, and 2.a appeared to be based on \nclassified information, and asked that the admissibility of the underlying evidence be \ndecided in advance of the evidence being offered. I denied the motion, because \nApplicant did not convince me that the issues could not be resolved in due course at the \ntime the evidence was offered. (HX XLXI.) \n \nMotion to Strike Certain Paragraphs of the SOR \n \n \nAfter Department Counsel presented his case-in-chief, Applicant moved to strike \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 2.a on the ground that Department Counsel failed to \npresent a prima facie case. Applicant moved to strike SOR \u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 2.d, 1.e, \nand 2.f by removing the term \u201csensitive information\u201d from each allegation, on the ground \nthat Department Counsel had failed to present evidence defining \u201csensitive information.\u201d \nI denied the motion because there is no authority in the Directive to \u201cstrike\u201d an \nallegation. The authorized remedies are to amend an allegation to conform to the \nevidence, or to resolve the allegation in an applicant\u2019s favor if it is not supported by \nsubstantial evidence. Neither side moved to amend the SOR. \n \nFailure to Sequester Witness \n \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of an expert witness regarding evidence \nadduced through polygraph examination. Over Department Counsel\u2019s objection, I \npermitted the expert witness to be present in the hearing room while a polygraph \nexaminer testified about his interview of Applicant. (Tr. 5/25 at 45-46.) Fed. R. Evid. 615 \nrecognizes an exception to the sequestration rule for an expert whose opinion is to be \nbased upon the testimony of another witness. See United States v. Seschillie, 310 F.3d \n1208 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 953 (2003); Mayo v. Tri-Bell Indus., Inc., 787 \nF.2d 1007, 1013 (5th Cir. 1986). \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the statutes \npertaining to protection of agency functions, classification of documents, designation of \ndocuments as \u201cFor Official Use Only\u201d (FOUO), Executive Orders and statutes \nprescribing standards of ethical conduct, and the Freedom of Information Act. (HX III as \n\n \n6 \n \n \namended by HX IX, HX XXIV, and LVII). Applicant objected on the ground that the \nversions presented for administrative notice were not relevant because they were not in \neffect at the time of the conduct alleged in the SOR. (HX XVI, XXV, and XLIV.) I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request as amended, subject to evaluating the relevance of the \nmaterial. \n \n \nDepartment Counsel also requested that I take administrative notice of two \nAppeal Board decisions (HX LXI) and documents pertaining to the nomination and \nconfirmation of a U.S. ambassador (HX LXIV). Applicant did not object, and I took \nadministrative notice as requested.  \n \n \nApplicant requested that I take administrative notice of Department of Defense \nregulations pertaining to designation of documents as FOUO. (HX XLIV.) Department \nCounsel did not object, and I took administrative notice as requested. (HX LVII.) \n \n \nIn support of an objection to AX 172, Department Counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of a DOD Inspector General Report pertaining to the substandard \nduty performance of the declarant. (Tr. 6/30 at 6-10). There was no objection, and I took \nadministrative notice as requested. The report is attached to the record as HX LXV. \n \n \nExcept for HX LXV, the adjudicative facts administratively noticed are set out \nbelow in my Findings of Fact. I have considered the conclusions in HX LXV in \ndetermining the weight to be given to AX 172. The legal references administratively \nnoticed are discussed below in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d section of this decision.  \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nBefore and during the hearing, both sides made numerous evidentiary \nobjections. Two tables summarizing these objections, my rulings, and the record \ncitations are attached to this decision as appendices. Many of Applicant\u2019s objections \nwere mooted by testimony of the declarant, withdrawal of SOR allegations, or my \nfavorable findings of fact. The table of evidentiary issues for government exhibits is \nattached as Appendix A; the table for Applicant\u2019s exhibits is attached as Appendix B. \n \n \nThe objections by both sides were based on relevance, the hearsay rule, lack of \nauthentication, denial of the right to cross-examine the declarant, and the rule of \ncompleteness. I denied the objections based on relevance and hearsay, following the \nAppeal Board\u2019s general preference for administrative judges to admit evidence and then \nconsider the evidentiary concerns in determining its weight. See ISCR Case No. 04-\n12449 (App. Bd. May 14, 2009). It is well-settled that hearsay evidence is admissible in \nsecurity clearance hearings. See Hoska v. U.S. Department of the Army,  677 F. 2d \n131, 138-39 (D.C. Cir. 1982); ISCR Case No. 03-06770 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2004). In \nseveral instances, the objections based on denial of the right to cross-examine the \ndeclarant were mooted when the declarant testified. Where the declarant was not \nidentified or did not testify, I admitted the documents as official agency records, but \nconsidered the opposing party\u2019s inability to cross-examine the declarant in deciding the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nweight to be given to the documents. See ISCR Case No. 06-06496 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, \n2009). \n \nApplicant made numerous objections based on Fed. R. Evid. 106, the \u201crule of \ncompleteness.\u201d The rule is intended to ensure that evidentiary material is not taken out \nof context. Although some exhibits were heavily redacted, the redactions did not affect \nmy ability to determine the context in which statements were made.  \n \nIn most cases, the \u201ccompleteness\u201d objection was actually an objection based on \ninability to identify or cross-examine the declarant under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22. In this \nregard, the Appeal Board has held that Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22 does not require exclusion of \nstatements that are admissible as official records under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. See ISCR \nCase No. 06-06496, supra.  \n \nTo the extent that Applicant attempted to use Fed. R. Evid. 106 as a discovery \nrule, arguing that Department Counsel should obtain the redacted portions of \ndocuments and provide them to Applicant, I denied the objections, because Rule 106 \ndoes not require the proponent of the document to supply the missing parts to the \nopposing party. It merely entitles the opposing party to admission of the missing parts. \nApplicant was not entitled to invoke Rule 106 to insist that Department Counsel present \nthe redacted portions of a document. However, he was entitled to present whatever \nevidence he had concerning redacted portions of the document as part of his case. \nBeech Aircraft Corp. v. Rainey, 488 U.S. 153, 171-72 (1988).   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the allegations, but he admitted \nsome facts alleged in his hearing testimony. His admissions at the hearing are \ndescribed below and included my findings of fact. The facts administratively noticed are \nset out below. \n \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old foreign affairs consultant employed by a defense \ncontractor. He held a security clearance from June 1974 until 1986, and from 1989 to \n1993. He applied for eligibility for access to Special Compartmented Information (SCI), \nbut his application was denied by another agency in January 1993 (GX 20.) He did not \nappeal, because his political appointment was about to expire and he no longer needed \na clearance. (Tr. 5/27 at 6-8.) He received a DOD clearance in January 1997 (GX 1 at \n9.) He applied for a clearance from another agency, and it was denied in November \n2000 (GX 23.) He applied again for a clearance and SCI access as a DOD employee in \n2002. His application was denied in March 2003, based on reciprocal recognition of the \nearlier denial by the other agency. Based on the denial of SCI eligibility, his collateral \nclearances were revoked in 2004. (GX 42 at 21; Tr. 5/27 at 11-14.) \n \n \nApplicant holds a doctorate from a prestigious university and is widely regarded \nas a foreign policy expert. He has published numerous books and scholarly articles on \ncountries of strategic importance to the United States. Two of his books were admitted \n\n \n8 \n \n \nas evidence in this case (AX 160 and 161). He speaks several foreign languages \nfluently. He worked as an assistant political affairs officer at the United Nations in 1969-\n70. \n \n \nApplicant began working for a defense contractor in 1973. His employer \nperformed classified research for various agencies of the Government. Employees were \nrequired to complete the requirements for a doctoral degree as soon as possible, and \nthey were expected to establish academic credentials by becoming widely published. \nShortly after being employed, Applicant met the national security lawyer who later \nrepresented him in his efforts to keep his SCI clearance. (Tr. 5/26 at 113-14.) \nApplicant\u2019s employer had an extensive collection of classified research materials, an \nextensive manual of industrial security practices, and its own security department. His \nemployer required prepublication review of everything to be published, in addition to any \nprepublication review required by the contract sponsor. As part of the employer\u2019s \n\u201cpublish or perish\u201d policy, it would publish articles and send them to selected groups of \nnational security experts, journalists, and other generalists and specialists. The articles \nwere based on open source material but often addressed politically sensitive issues. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s work involved interviewing foreign military officials, making \nspeeches, testifying before Congress, writing editorials for major newspapers, and \ntalking to newspaper reporters. (Tr. 5/26 at 118-147; AX 1 through 9; AX 11.) \n \n \nApplicant was allowed to work at home on unclassified projects involving open \nsource material, and he accumulated an extensive library of books and periodicals, as \nwell as an extensive computer database. (Tr. 5/26 at 147-49.) If Applicant created a \ndocument at home that later incorporated classified materials, he would take the \ndocument to his office, load it onto a classified computer, and then add the classified \nmaterial. (Tr. 5/26 at 150-51.) \n \n \nApplicant served as a staffer for four Senate committees from 1978 to 1984 and \nfrom 1986 to 1991. He worked intermittently as a special government employee for a \nfew days in May 1981 and from January 1998 to June 1999. He was a federal employee \nfrom September 1984 to April 1986, from August 1992 to February 1993, and from July \n2001 to March 2003. (AX 159; GX 42 at 18.) He began working for a defense contractor \nin 2007 and submitted his current application for a clearance in connection with that \nemployment. (GX 1.) If he receives a clearance, he will work on a DOD contract, \nsupervised by a senior official in the DOD, who has worked in DOD for 36 years and \nhas known Applicant since 1973. This official knows that Applicant is outspoken and \ncontroversial, but he considers him \u201ca person of great integrity who has displayed a \nfastidious attention to protecting classified information.\u201d (AX 138 at 2.)  \n \nDuring his last stint of federal employment in 2001-2003, Applicant became \nconcerned about a possible conflict of interest arising from his multiple and overlapping \nroles as a special government employee, a private citizen engaged in research and \nwriting, and a defense contractor. During an interview with DOHA officials in September \n2009, he stated that he consulted with an attorney in the government ethics office and \nwas advised that there was no conflict of interest. (GX 42 at 19.) \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a controversial person. He was described by a former fellow Senate \nstaffer as a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d (GX 40 at 31.) A former supervisor in the DOD described \nhim as extraordinarily intelligent, intense, and dedicated, but commented that his \naggressive personality often irritated others and provoked complaints that he \noverstepped his authority. (GX 40 at 15.) When Applicant was nominated for a \nPresidential appointment in 1981, eight senators supported his nomination but \ncautioned the President that he lacked humility. (GX 34.)  \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant had a reputation among some Senate staffers for \nmeticulously safeguarding classified documents. A former staffer, now a career \ngovernment employee with a top secret clearance, testified that she worked for \nApplicant for more than four years. She regarded Applicant as her mentor on security \nawareness and the importance of discretion in a political environment. She described \nhim as extremely meticulous in protecting classified information. (AX 63 at 3-5.)  \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s former fellow staffers, who worked for seven years as an \nintelligence analyst and 14 years as a Senate staffer, testified that Applicant is a brilliant \nexpert in foreign military affairs, national security, and foreign policy. He described \nApplicant as very conscientious and a person of high integrity. He described the work of \na staffer as \u201cwalking on eggshells every day,\u201d because of the need to draw the line \nbetween classified and unclassified information and to balance security requirements \nwith political strategy. In this witness\u2019s view, everything in the Congress is politically \nsensitive. (Tr. 5/25 at 147, 150, 154-56, 208.) He testified Applicant was admired by \nfellow staffers for his \u201cability to balance the responsibility of talking to the press and yet \nmaintaining the boundary between what\u2019s classified and what\u2019s unclassified.\u201d (Tr. 5/25 \nat 158.) \n \nApplicant is a worrier, second-guessing himself after making a comment and \nwondering if he divulged classified information. He testified that when there was a \u201chuge \nfront page story\u201d based on a classified leak, he wondered if there could have been the \n\u201cslightest scintilla\u201d of a connection between something he said to a reporter and the \nnewspaper story. (Tr. 5/27 at 103). A former Senate staffer who has known him for \nabout 20 years testified he has \u201can excruciating conscience,\u201d and that he \u201cmay \nsometimes exaggerate his influence.\u201d (Tr. 5/26 at 76.) He is intimidated by polygraph \nexaminers because of the power they have to rephrase possible admissions or to \nsubmit a report indicating deception. (Tr. 5/26 at 311-12, 352-53.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former lawyer has considerable expertise and experience in national \nsecurity law and security clearance investigations, has served as a security consultant \nto DOD agencies, and provided security advice to Applicant\u2019s DOD supervisor in the \nmid-1980s. He is aware of the allegations in the SOR as well as other security \ninvestigations, has advised Applicant on ways to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation and to protect himself from false accusations. He describes Applicant as \u201can \nextraordinarily self-disciplined person.\u201d (Tr. 5/5 at 150.) \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s potential future supervisor asked a special assistant with \nconsiderable military and civilian experience in security administration and practices, \nhandling of classified material, use of polygraphs in counter-intelligence, and the \npolitical process, to review GX 24, the report of investigation supporting the decision to \ndeny Applicant eligibility for SCI access. The report of investigation, which is heavily \nredacted, addressed numerous allegations, including those now alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.k, and 1.l. The special assistant reviewed only the redacted version, \nbecause he could not obtain the unredacted, classified version of the report of \ninvestigation. (Tr. 5/5 at 190.) The special assistant concluded that the report of \ninvestigation was seriously flawed in numerous respects. He concluded that the \nadjudicator was biased, did not understand key facts, omitted facts favorable to \nApplicant, and did not use an evidence-based process for his conclusions. (AX 108.) He \nshowed his draft report to Applicant\u2019s current sponsor, who told him to send the report \nto a senior official in DOD. (Tr. 5/5 at 170.)  \n \nThe special assistant worked with Applicant for about 15 months until Applicant \nlost his clearance, and worked with him on unclassified matters from 2002 to the date of \nhis testimony. He found that Applicant was very meticulous in handling classified \nmaterials and regards him as a person of high integrity. (Tr. 5/5 at 164-65.) He also \ntestified that Applicant \u201ccan be abrasive at times, viewed as arrogant by a lot of people \nand probably rightfully so,\u201d but he had no concerns about his judgment on security \nissues. (Tr. 5/5 at 195.) He admitted that, having worked with Applicant for some time, \nhe was not a \u201ccompletely independent and neutral\u201d reviewer of GX 24. (Tr. 5/5 at 201.) \n \nSeveral witnesses, including a senior member of the intelligence community for \n28 years, testified that denial of Applicant\u2019s SCI eligibility was motivated by \ndisagreement with his views and was the result of trumped-up charges. (Tr. 5/25 at 213-\n231; AX 107.) Another former senior official in the intelligence community, who served \nin four senior positions by Presidential appointment and who has known Applicant for \nabout 48 years, testified that he supported Applicant\u2019s effort to reinstate his security \nclearance in 2005, but the effort was terminated when Applicant no longer needed a \nclearance. The witness testified he believed the decision to revoke Applicant\u2019s \nclearance was the result of policy disputes rather than legitimate security concerns. He \nwas aware the Applicant had taken positions suggesting that policy experts had been \ndeceived by false information, and those experts were embarrassed when the \ninformation was shown to be false. Based on his personal and professional interaction \nwith Applicant, he considers him a \u201csound and honest man.\u201d He disagrees with the \ncharacterization of Applicant as undisciplined and unwilling to follow rules and \nregulations. When asked if he recommended that Applicant be given a security \nclearance, he responded, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d (Tr. 5-25 at 287-307; AX 116.) \n \n \nApplicant has consulted with a psychiatrist for many years, beginning in August \n1988, when he sought help for depression, manifested by irritability, depressed mood, \ninsensitivity to others, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. In February 1989, the psychiatrist \nconcluded that his depression had been successfully treated with psychotherapy and \nmedication. (AX 167 at Exhibit A.) In May 1995, his psychiatrist supported his \n\n \n11 \n \n \napplication for a clearance, noting that he saw Applicant three times a week and that \nApplicant had improved his overall behavior through insight gained in psychotherapy. \n(AX 167 at Exhibit B.) In May 2010, the psychiatrist submitted an affidavit addressing \nthe issues in the SOR. The affidavit noted Applicant\u2019s tendency to procrastinate, his \ntendency to be too self-critical, and his failure to be more assertive during interviews by \nsecurity investigators and polygraph examiners. (AX 167 at 1-5.)2  \n \n \nIn the last ten years, Applicant has worked to reduce the stressors in his life. He \nmarried a woman he has known for 20 years, cut back on his foreign travel, cut back on \ninteraction with foreign officials, and reduced his media contact. (Tr. 5/27 at 68.) He has \nbeen chastened by his long fight to obtain, retain, and regain his security clearances. \nHe believes he has become more cautious and less flamboyant and provocative than \nhe was 10 years ago. (Tr. 5/27 at 68-70.) He testified he is wary of dealing with the \npress, having been \u201ctoo badly burned in the past.\u201d (Tr. 5/27 at 35-36, 47-48.) \n \nNumerous present and former senior officials within the DOD testified, submitted \nstatements, or both in support of granting Applicant a clearance. They describe him as a \nperson of high integrity, good judgment, reliability, discretion, and conscientious \nprotection of classified information. (AX 168, 170-173, and 175.) \n \nApplicant denied all the allegations in the SOR. Department Counsel withdrew \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j. (Tr. 5/25 at 323; Tr. 5/27 at 12.) The remaining allegations concern \nten separate incidents. For seven incidents, the same conduct is alleged under \nGuideline E and Guideline K. My findings of fact are set out below under each Guideline \nE allegation and its Guideline K counterpart for cross-alleged conduct.3 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 2.a: In 1977, Applicant was given a draft presidential policy \ndocument by a stranger, had reason to believe it contained classified information, \nand gave a copy of it to a newspaper reporter. \n \n \nIn 1977, when Applicant was then employed by a defense contractor, he was \ngiven a document by a young man whom he did not know at a cocktail party. The man \nappeared to be a consultant for a defense contractor. The man told Applicant that he \nbelieved the document was consistent with Applicant\u2019s views on future relations with a \nforeign country of strategic importance to the United States, and that he had \nincorporated many of his Applicant\u2019s ideas into the paper. Applicant was well known for \nhis views advocating increased military contacts with the country. The man told \nApplicant he hoped the document would be part of the President\u2019s review of U.S. policy. \nAt the hearing, Applicant described the document as an \u201cadvocacy piece.\u201d The \ndocument had no classification markings. (Tr. 5/26 at 159, 163-65.) \n \n                                                          \n2 The psychiatrist\u2019s affidavit refers to Exhibit C, a 1978 letter recommending approval of Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a clearance. Exhibit C is not included in AX 167, but it is included in the record as AX 12. \n \n3 The SOR allegations are compressed and summarized in this decision. They are intended to be topic \nheadings rather than a full recitation of each allegation. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nThe President issued a classified Policy Review Memorandum (PRM) on April 5, \n1977. It is now declassified. It directed a review of future U.S. relations with the foreign \ncountry, It identified topics to be studied, defined the problem to be analyzed, set a \ndeadline for completion of the study, and assigned responsibility for conducting it. (AX \n126.) \n \n \nIn early June 1977, Applicant told a newspaper reporter that there were people in \nthe Congress who were keeping alive the issue of future relations with the foreign \ncountry. (Tr. 5/26 at 167-69.) The reporter was a well-known journalist that Applicant\u2019s \nemployer had encouraged him to use to gain favorable publicity. About two weeks later, \non June 23, 1997, the newspaper announced the issuance of the PRM. The newspaper \narticle recites that the newspaper obtained a copy of the classified PRM on the date of \nthe article. The article contains a broad discussion of U.S. foreign policy, discusses the \ndiffering views within the administration, and suggests a policy decision that was \ncontrary to Applicant\u2019s views. (AX 125.) Applicant denied giving any classified \ninformation document to the reporter. (Tr. 5/26 at 168-69.) \n \n \nIn October 1996, Applicant submitted a sworn statement to a polygraph \nexaminer, in which he talked about his contacts with the newspaper reporter in 1977. \nHe told the investigator that the reporter \u201cwrote two articles for which I provided \ninformation that drew upon my classified knowledge of U.S. government debates on \npolicy.\u201d He told the investigator that he concluded that, after undergoing polygraph \nexaminations and receiving clearances in 1978 and 1983, the information he provided \nto the reporter was unclassified, but that he has \u201calways had strong doubts about the \nclassification.\u201d GX 6 at 1. At the time Applicant submitted his statement to the polygraph \nexaminer, the Presidential document had not been declassified and Applicant had not \nseen it. (Tr. 5/26 at 171.) The cocktail-party document is not in the record, and the only \nevidence regarding it is Applicant\u2019s statement to the examiner.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he disclosed the incident to the polygraph examiner as an \nexample of a challenging situation where he had \u201cdrawn the line\u201d between classified and \nunclassified information in his dealings with reporters. He also testified that he had been \nadvised to tell a polygraph examiner about anything that worried him, in order avoid \nhaving the examiner conclude that deception was indicated. (Tr. 5/26 at 167-68.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed again in October 1999, in connection with his \napplication for access to Special Compartmented Information (SCI). A one-paragraph \nsummary of the interview recites that Applicant gave the cocktail-party document to the \nreporter and \u201crationalized passing [the document] to the media by telling himself that the \npaper had no classification on it.\u201d  \n \nThe interview summary of the October 1999 interview also recites that Applicant \n\u201cfurther stated that in hindsight he should have checked and described it as a judgment \ncall.\u201d GX 24 at 17. At the hearing, Applicant denied making the statement. He surmised \nthat this statement may have been in response to a \u201cthrowaway question\u201d from the \nexaminer, such as, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been better if you had checked?\u201d (Tr. 5/27 at 102.) \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant had an ongoing relationship with a well-\nknown newspaper reporter that was not only permitted but encouraged by his employer. \nApplicant received a document advocating a change in U.S. policy at a party, and told \nthe reporter about it. Two weeks later, the newspaper announced the policy review, \nciting classified information it received on the day the newspaper was published, and \nsuggesting a policy change that was contrary to Applicant\u2019s views. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant gave classified or sensitive information to the reporter. However, \nApplicant\u2019s failure to verify that the document contained no classified information raises \na concern about his judgment.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: In June 1978, Applicant was fired from a Senate staff position for his \ncomments to the media concerning U.S. policy while on a congressional fact-\nfinding team visiting overseas. \n \n \nApplicant was hired in February 1978 to serve on the staff of a Senate \ncommittee, working directly for the minority staff director of that committee. When \nApplicant accepted the position, he was still working on a project for the DOD. Applicant \nmade a trip to the Far East in July 1978 to complete his DOD project. Although he was \na member of the Senate staff, he did not represent his Senate committee. (Tr. 5/4 at \n332, 364.) However, some of the topics to be discussed on the trip were of interest to \nboth the Senate committee and the DOD. (Tr. 5/26 at 189-90.) As part of his planning \nfor the trip, Applicant requested support from area embassies and military commands, \nrequested visits with senior U.S. and foreign military officials, visits to military facilities, \nand an overflight of key military terrain and facilities. He also included suggested topics \nwith U.S. foreign policy implications during meetings with officials. Although Applicant \nmade this trip as a contractor employed by a DOD agency, the tasking message \nidentifies him as the \u201cnew senior analyst of a Senate committee.\u201d (AX 149.) He testified \nhe did not remember if he informed the minority staff director, his immediate supervisor, \nof his schedule of DOD activities. (Tr. 5/27 at 109.) However, a committee staff \nadministrator gave the minority staff director a copy of Applicant\u2019s request for support \nand the follow-up correspondence. (AX 15.) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s visit with foreign defense officials, he made comments that \nwere interpreted as possible shifts in U.S. foreign policy, and his comments were \nreported in the local press. (GX 33.) Due to translation problems, his comments were \nportrayed as more extreme than what he actually said. (AX 27 at 5; Tr. 5/27 at 193-94, \n201.) Applicant also made comments that were translated to suggest that the U.S. \nAmbassador might not be \u201cin touch\u201d with current developments in Congress. The \nambassador sent a letter to the chair of the senate committee, complaining that \nApplicant had not visited him or any of the ranking members of the embassy staff, had \nmade comments inconsistent with the embassy\u2019s efforts, and had suggested that he \nwas out of touch with congressional activities. (GX 32.) \n \n \nApplicant was recalled from overseas, and his supervisor on the Senate \ncommittee \u201cgave [him] six weeks to find new employment.\u201d His supervisor believed that, \nas a Senate staff member, he should have kept a \u201clow profile\u201d and stayed behind the \n\n \n14 \n \n \nscenes. (GX 40 at 27-28.) An investigation by a staffer for another senator concluded \nthat Applicant\u2019s termination was premature and motivated by political pressure rather \nthan the substance of the issues. (AX 16; AX 27; Tr. 5/4 at 334.) \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant made the overseas trip under difficult \ncircumstances, traveling with a Senate committee on a fact-finding tour but working \nindependently of the committee on a DOD project. He made some protocol mistakes \nand was the victim of a poor translation that made his comments about an ambassador \nand suggestions of a change in U.S. policy sound more inappropriate than they were. \nNevertheless, his unguarded comments about sensitive U.S. policy issues and an \nambassador\u2019s lack of political awareness raise questions about his judgment. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 2.a: In 1980, Applicant provided sensitive but unclassified \ninformation to a newspaper reporter to discredit and embarrass a political \nadversary, and failed to inform his supervisor that he had leaked the information.  \n \n \nIn December 1980, while working as a Senate staffer, Applicant was detailed to \nserve on the presidential transition team. Team members were detailed to various \nexecutive branch agencies to represent the President-elect and his advisors during the \ntransfer of power to the new administration. (Tr. 5/25 at 190.) Applicant continued to \nreport to his supervisor on the Senate staff and was paid as a Senate staffer. He was \nthe deputy team chief, and his duties included responding to press inquiries. (Tr. 5/25 at \n160-61.) After the inauguration of the new President, Applicant stayed on the team as \nan acting member of an executive branch agency. (Tr. 5/26 at 240.) \n \nWhile serving on the transition team, Applicant received an electronic \ncommunication that was marked \u201cSecret\u201d but had no internal security markings. The \npractice in the executive department in which the communication was generated was to \nmark the overall classification of the materials, but to not mark the classification of each \nparagraph. (Tr. 5/5 at 186-87.) The communication included unclassified notes about a \nmeeting with a Senator and senior foreign officials. The notes indicated to Applicant that \nthe Senator had misrepresented the policy position of the President-elect on a specific \nissue. Newspaper reports quoted the Senator as representing that he and the President \nagreed on the issues discussed. (AX 141.) After being asked for comments by a \nnewspaper reporter, Applicant consulted with other team members and his Senate \nsupervisor about whether he should talk to the press about the misrepresentation of the \nPresident-elect\u2019s views and, if so, what he should say. After clearing his remarks with \nhis Senate supervisor, he told the newspaper reporter that the Senator\u2019s views were not \nthose of the President-elect. (Tr. 5/25 at 167.)  \n \n \nThe file pertaining to the denial of Applicant\u2019s SCI access includes a summary of \nan interview with a polygraph examiner in October 1999. The summary recites that \nApplicant admitted to the examiner that he gave the information to the newspaper \nintentionally to embarrass the Senator, to please the Senators who shared his views, \nand to influence political outcomes. (GX 24 at 17.)  \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that the polygraph examiner\u2019s summary of their interview was \nnot accurate in three respects. First, Applicant responded to an inquiry from a reporter, \nwho recited the facts from newspaper articles, not from internal government \ncommunications. The thrust of the reporter\u2019s call was to ask if the transition team \nbelieved the Senator was representing the President-elect when he made his \nstatements. Second, Applicant did not admit that his motive was to embarrass the \nSenator. His intent was the draw a line between the Senator\u2019s views and what the \nPresident-elect had said during the campaign. Third, Applicant did not act to please \nconservative senators. He acted to carry out the instructions of conservative senators to \ndistance the Senator\u2019s message from the President-elect\u2019s message. (Tr. 5/26 at 229-\n230.) Applicant did not see the polygraph examiner\u2019s summarization of his interview \nuntil he appealed the denial of his application for SCI access. (Tr. 5/26 at 238.) \n \nIn an interview with Department Counsel in September 2009, Applicant stated \nthat he heard \u201cgossip\u201d about a leak investigation, but he did not volunteer any \ninformation because he was not responsible for the leak. He stated that the information \nin the newspaper story was much broader than he had disclosed to the reporter and \nmore than he knew about the incident. (GX 42 at 44.) \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant, while a member of the presidential \ntransition team, spoke to a newspaper reporter to contradict a senator\u2019s representation \nthat he and the President agreed on a specific issue. Applicant cleared his contact and \nthe substance of his remarks with his Senate committee supervisor. There is no \nevidence that Applicant disclosed classified information. The information was politically \nsensitive, but not \u201csensitive\u201d in the national-security sense.  \n \nFurthermore, the interview summary pertaining to Applicant\u2019s motives does not \npurport to quote Applicant. The identity of the interviewer was withheld, and the \ninterviewer was not available for cross-examination. Under these circumstances, I find \nApplicant\u2019s statement of motives for contradicting the Senator more plausible and \ncredible than the anonymous interview\u2019s summary. I conclude that Applicant has \nrebutted SOR \u00b6 1.d and the part of SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleging \u00b6 1.d. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 2.a: In 1983, while working as a Senate staffer and participating in \na congressional delegation\u2019s visit overseas, Applicant provided sensitive \ninformation to a newspaper reporter concerning the personal activities of a \nsenator during the trip for the purpose of embarrassing the senator. \n \n \nIn November 1983, Applicant was serving as the legislative assistant to the \nchairman of a Senate committee. The chairman assigned him to participate in a two-\nweek Congressional fact-finding trip to several countries. The Congressional delegation \nincluded the Senator alleged in the SOR, another more junior Senator, support staffs for \nboth senators, several executive branch officials, and Applicant. The senior Senator on \nthe trip was a political rival of the committee chairman, and there was friction throughout \nthe trip because Applicant was regarded as the chairman\u2019s \u201cwatchdog.\u201d  \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \n \nApplicant and several other members of the delegation were excluded from \nmeetings because there were too few seats. Applicant was frustrated by the exclusion \nbecause it made it impossible for him to report to the committee chairman about the \ndelegation\u2019s activities. In a sworn statement in February 1989, Applicant commented \nthat he thought there was too much shopping and frivolous activity on the trip. Applicant \ntestified that he had heard the rumors about excessive shopping and avoidance of \ncustoms duties, but he had no personal knowledge. When the delegation returned, they \nwere confronted by a newspaper reporter about the senior Senator\u2019s jewelry purchases \nand an allegation that the Senator had not paid the required customs duty. Someone, \nnot positively identified in the record, contacted the committee chairman and accused \nApplicant of leaking the accusation to the press. Applicant was suspected of leaking the \nembarrassing information because of his abrasive personality and his frustration at \nbeing excluded from meetings during the trip. He believed he was the frequent target of \nunsubstantiated allegations because of his lack of tact and offensive behavior. (GX 8 at \n10.) The committee chairman told a security investigator that Applicant\u2019s actions often \nwere a source of extreme irritation and embarrassment to him. (GX 41 at 18.) \n \nThe committee chairman asked Applicant if he was the source of the information, \nand he told Applicant to try to kill the story because it would likely cause the Senator\u2019s \ndefeat for reelection. Applicant contacted the reporter, told him how successful the trip \nhad been with respect to counter-narcotics legislation, and reminded the reporter of a \nprevious lawsuit against him for malicious reporting of derogatory information about a \nprominent businessman. The story was never published. (Tr. 5/26 at 248-50.) \n \n \nThe delegation secretary, now an employee of an intelligence agency with a \nclearance, submitted a sworn statement to a security investigator in February 1989. She \nstated that the newspaper reporter began researching the story shortly after the trip. He \ncontacted several members of the delegation and obtained copies of official \ncommunications during the trip. She was present when Applicant told the reporter that \n\u201che was making something out of nothing.\u201d (GX 35 at 9-10; AX 63 at 9-10.)  \n \nAccording to Applicant, the reporter told him that the senior Senator\u2019s staff \ndiscussed the shopping issue with him. The reporter appeared to have read the trip \ncommunications during the trip. (GX 8 at 9; GX 42 at 53-65.) During a DOHA interview \nin September 2009, Applicant pointed out that there were \u201cfive or more\u201d persons who \ncould have leaked the information, such as the executive branch personnel, who owed \nno loyalty to the Senator, or the customs officials. (GX 42 at 63.) When the Senator was \ninterviewed in February 1989 by a security investigator, she remembered Applicant \nbeing a member of the delegation, but she had no recollection of his duties and could \nprovide no \u201cinsight or information\u201d about him. (AX 62.) \n \n \nI conclude Applicant has rebutted this allegation. The evidence shows that the \nreporter talked to several members of the delegation and obtained copies of its \ncommunications. The conclusion that Applicant leaked the information is based on \nspeculation and conjecture. \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 2.a: In April 1986, Applicant was dismissed from a senior \ngovernment position for providing classified information concerning U.S. arms \nshipments to foreign countries to a newspaper reporter.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g:  In April 1986, Applicant intentionally withheld information concerning \nthe extent of the sensitive information he had provided to the newspaper reporter. \n \n \nApplicant was dismissed from his position in the DOD in April 1986, but the basis \nfor his dismissal was a report from a polygraph examiner that Applicant had admitted \ncompromising the identity of a covert intelligence agent serving overseas. Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor later learned that the report was false, and that someone else was source of \nthe information about the identity of the intelligence agent. (Tr.5/5 at 31; AX 53; AX 137 \nat \u00b6 7.) His supervisor believes that the false report was in retribution for exposing \nfactual errors in the agency\u2019s analysis of a sensitive issue. (AX 53; AX 137 at \u00b6 15.) \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s supervisor learned that he had fired Applicant based on a \nfalsified report from a polygraph examiner, he contacted members of the Senate and \nsenior officials in the DOD and told them that he had made a mistake by firing Applicant. \nHe supported reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance when Applicant was considered for \npositions on the Senate staff and within the DOD that required a clearance. (Tr. 5/5 at \n30-38; AX 53; AX 69.) DOD determined that Applicant\u2019s security clearance had been \nrevoked \u201csomewhat precipitously,\u201d and his clearance was reinstated in November 1989. \n(AX 162.).  \n \n \nIn 1984, Applicant\u2019s supervisor was advised by a security consultant to prohibit \nsubordinates with access to highly sensitive programs from speaking with the press. \n(AX 139 at 4.) The security consultant testified that former staffers tend to have high \nconfidence that they can deal with the press effectively, but that press contacts by \nsubordinates working with \u201ctruly sensitive national security information\u201d was a \u201cpoor \njuxtaposition.\u201d (Tr. 5/5 at 143.) Applicant\u2019s supervisor initially heeded the advice. The \nsecurity consultant testified that Applicant complained about the prohibition on media \ncontacts, but Applicant could not remember having any direct conversations with the \nconsultant about the prohibition (Tr. 5/4 at 147; Tr. 5/27 at 122-23.) Around 1985, \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor authorized him to be the office\u2019s spokesman with the press. (AX \n137 at 14.) Applicant believed that his supervisor had instructed him to meet with the \npress regularly, and he did so about once a week. (Tr. 5/26 at 247.) Applicant also \nbelieved he had a mandate to find out what stories the reporters were working on so \nthat senior DOD officials could \u201cstop bad stories or shape ones that were coming out.\u201d \n(Tr. 5/27 at 128, 135.) \n \nApplicant began having regular contacts with a newspaper reporter in 1985 and \n1986. He had dinner with this reporter in February and early March 1986, to discuss a \nbiographical article the reporter was writing about a senior intelligence official. Applicant \nbelieved he had \u201ca broad mandate \u2013 based on common sense \u2013 to use unclassified \ninformation to convey a favorable impression of defense policy to the press and to the \nCongress.\u201d (GX 10 at 7.) He testified these two dinner meetings were the only times in \n\n \n18 \n \n \nhis career that he discussed official business with the press over dinner. (Tr. 5/27 at \n142.) His supervisor recognized that he may have \u201coverused\u201d Applicant as a press \nspokesman, and he talked to Applicant about \u201ctoning it down a bit.\u201d (AX 137 at \u00b6 13.) A \nformer colleague and close personal friend of Applicant told investigators that Applicant \nmaintained a regular association with a number of newspaper reporters. (GX 40 at 54.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified he did not remember a \u201cmoratorium\u201d on press \ncontacts, but he did remember his supervisor asking him to \u201ctone it down a bit.\u201d He \ninterpreted his supervisor\u2019s guidance to mean that he should spend less time with the \nmedia. (Tr. 5/27 at 118.) \n \n \nIn March 1986, Applicant talked to a newspaper reporter concerning U.S. arms \nshipments. He had worked for two years to overcome internal government opposition to \na covert operation involving arms shipments. His efforts came to fruition in 1985 when \nthe President approved the arms shipments.  \n \nOn the morning of Saturday, March 29, 1986, the reporter called Applicant at his \nhome and they discussed whether the reporter would attribute a quotation in the \nbiographical article to Applicant by name. Applicant was surprised when the reporter \ntold him that the biographical article would be accompanied by a story on the covert \narms shipments. The reporter read him the text of the story, did not ask him anything \nabout the decision to make the arms shipment, and did not ask him to confirm any \ndetails about the story. However, Applicant decided to try to talk him out of publishing \nthe article by denigrating the quality of the arms being shipped, falsely telling him that \nthe arms had already been shipped, and suggesting that the number of weapons \nshipped were fewer than what the article reported. The issue was politically sensitive \nbecause of the likelihood that some members of Congress would attempt to block the \nshipment if the presidential decision was disclosed prematurely. (GX 10 at 5; GX 12 at \n2; Tr. 5/26 at 260-62.) The article was published on March 30, 1986. (GX 25-GX 28.)  \n \nApplicant called his supervisor at home immediately after his conversation with \nthe reporter about the arms shipments and notified him of the conversation and the \nnewspaper story about to be published. His supervisor cautioned him about lying to the \npress because he would lose credibility, and thanked him for trying to kill the story. (Tr. \n5/26 at 262-63.) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s fellow Senate staffers testified that the arms shipment referred \nto in the newspaper article was one of several programs where the policy debate was \novert and debated publicly, but the details regarding execution of the policy were covert \nand classified. There were disagreements within the executive branch and significant \nopposition in Congress. (Tr. 5/4 at 273-81.) The witness was well acquainted with the \ntwo reporters responsible for the newspaper article. Based on his conversations with the \nreporters as well as other senate staffers, the witness concluded that the source of the \ninformation in the newspaper article came from senators or staffers and not from \nApplicant. (Tr. 5/4 at 285-292.) \n \n\n \n19 \n \n \n \nAnother former staffer who worked for Applicant testified that, after the \nnewspaper article appeared, she learned that the reporters had sources of information \nabout the arms shipment within the receiving country. (Tr. 5/4 at 302; AX 38.) She also \ntestified that she listened to a telephone conversation with a fellow staffer and the \nreporter who wrote the article, in which the staffer asked the reporter if Applicant was \nthe source and the reporter emphatically replied that he was not. (Tr. 5/4 at 304; AX 39.) \nShe listened to the conversation at Applicant\u2019s request and with the consent of the \nstaffer. In February 1989, she submitted a sworn statement to the two agents \ninvestigating the leak of information to the reporter, providing the same information \nabout the conversation between the staffer and the reporter as she did at the hearing. \n(AX 63 at 15.) \n \n \nA third staffer who worked with Applicant testified that during a conversation with \none of the newspaper reporter\u2019s rivals, he learned that Applicant was not the source of \nthe story. According to this staffer, the sources were several senators and another \nstaffer. (AX 40; Tr. 5/25 at 173-75.) The consensus among Applicant\u2019s fellow staffers \nwas that Applicant had no motive to leak the story because it threatened to undo all his \nwork toward presidential approval of the arms shipments. (Tr. 5/25 at 192.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by polygraph examiners on March 5, March 31, and \nMay 5, 1987, about his conversations with the reporter. During these, interviews, \nApplicant used a highlighter to mark the portions of the newspaper article that he had \ndiscussed with the reporter. (Tr. 5/4 at 206; GX 25; GX 26; GX 29.4) None of the \nhighlighted portions were classified. Applicant was not the original source of most of the \ninformation in the article, but he acknowledged that he was the source of several \ncollateral elements of the story. He eventually acknowledged that his conversation with \nthe reporter may have had the effect of confirming the story. (GX 12 at 4; AX 123 at 17; \nTr. 5/4 at 289; Tr. 5/5 at 125.) At the end of the March 5 interview, the examiner \nsuggested that Applicant had not been totally truthful, and Applicant responded: \u201cI\u2019m \nbeyond the point, where I can accurately and precisely say or know for sure how much \nof my conversations with [the reporter] are in that article. I did my best in trying to \nprevent the story from disclosing any classified information.\u201d The examiner put quotation \nmarks around Applicant\u2019s response to indicate that they were his exact words. (AX 130 \nat 8; Tr. 5/4 at 241.) \n \n \nAt the end of the second interview on March 31, the polygraph examiner reported \nthat Applicant admitted he had not been completely candid during the March 5 interview \nand that he had \u201chedged\u201d on the amount of the information he had provided to the \nreporter. (GX 29 at 1.) The examiner testified that he put the word \u201chedged\u201d in \nquotations in his report to indicate that it was the word used by Applicant. (Tr. 5/4 at \n214.)  \n \nIt is difficult to discern from the record what information Applicant withheld. The \nexaminer\u2019s report is heavily redacted and the examiner\u2019s report is the only record of the \n                                                          \n4 The copies of the newspaper article are the best available, but nearly illegible. Applicant prepared and \nsubmitted AX 132, a reconstructed copy of the article and highlighted portions. \n\n \n20 \n \n \nquestions and answers during the pretest interview or the examination. The examiner\u2019s \nreport reflects that one of the questions was whether Applicant provided or confirmed \nmore of the information in that article than he had previously revealed to the examiner. \n(GX 29 at 1, 3.) The examiner reported that Applicant denied that he had \u201crevealed\u201d any \nof the information in the newspaper story, but believed he \u201cmay have\u201d confirmed some \nitems in the story, again using quotation marks to indicate the exact words used by \nApplicant. (Tr. 5/4 at 239; GX 131 at 1.) According to the attorney representing \nApplicant at the time, Applicant was concerned about the meaning of \u201cconfirm\u201d and he \nfound it difficult to speculate about the impact of his comments on the newspaper \narticle. (GX 123 at 15.)  \n \nAccording to Applicant, the examiner asked him \u201cif it was even faintly possible \nthat the unclassified information and the misinformation [he] had disclosed to [the \nreporter] in sum could have somehow made [the reporter] more certain of his story.\u201d \nApplicant responded that if he were forced to speculate, it was \u201cbarely possible\u201d that he \nmight have confirmed what the reporter already knew. The examiner then asked \nApplicant if he had said this to the investigators in April 1986. Applicant answered \u201cNo,\u201d \nand the examiner said, \u201cYou should have told them.\u201d (GX 9 at 4.) Applicant\u2019s failure to \ndisclose the possibility that he had effectively confirmed the reporter\u2019s story is \napparently the basis for the allegation that he intentionally withheld information from \ninvestigators in April 1986. \n \nApplicant underwent a third polygraph by another examiner on May 5, 1987. The \nexaminer\u2019s report recites that during the pretest interview Applicant \u201cacknowledged that \nhe had not been candid\u201d during previous interviews. According to the examiner\u2019s report, \nApplicant \u201cdeliberately withheld information from the investigators in an attempt to \nminimize his responsibility for information that appeared in that article,\u201d and that, in \nMarch 1987, he \u201ccontinued to withhold information . . . in an attempt to reduce his \nculpability.\u201d (GX 30.) The examiner\u2019s report does not identify whether he is referring to \nthe March 5 interview, March 31 interview, or both. There is no evidence that Applicant \nwithheld any information during the May 5 interview. A memorandum from Applicant\u2019s \nlawyer during these three polygraph examinations indicates that the alleged lack of \ncandor referred to in the third examiner\u2019s report is the same difficulty with the term \n\u201cconfirm,\u201d discussed above regarding the first two polygraph examinations. (AX 123 at \n15-16.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at the time the newspaper article appeared reviewed the \nportions of the article highlighted or annotated by Applicant, and concluded that none of \nthe information was classified or sensitive. His supervisor also testified that the \ninformation could not have been designated as \u201cFor Official Use Only\u201d (FOUO), \nbecause that category of information did not exist in 1986. (Tr. 5/26 at 13-14.)5 \nNotwithstanding the concerns of the polygraph examiners, Applicant was granted a \nclearance in 1989. (Tr. 5/26 at 293.) \n \n                                                          \n5 While the FOUO designation may not have been used in the witness\u2019s agency in 1986, the designation \nwas used in the U.S. Army as early as the 1960s. See Guideline E Analysis at p. 30, infra. \n\n \n21 \n \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant did not provide classified or sensitive \ninformation to the reporter. It also establishes that Applicant\u2019s dismissal was not based \non a leak of classified information about arms shipments. Thus, I conclude that \nApplicant has rebutted SOR \u00b6 1.f, as cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \n \nThe evidence also establishes that Applicant did not intentionally withhold \ninformation about the extent of information he provided to the reporter. Applicant was \nreluctant to acknowledge that he had the effect of confirming the reporter\u2019s story. His \nreluctance to speculate on the impact his conversation had on the reporter\u2019s confidence \nin the story falls short of intentionally withholding information. I conclude he has rebutted \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 2.a: In 1995, Applicant disclosed classified information to foreign \nofficials about a U.S. Navy war game conducted in 1994. \n \n \nIn May 1994, Applicant was involved as a consultant in a four-day U.S. Navy war \ngame pitting U.S. forces against foreign military forces. The game scenario was \nunclassified but protected as FOUO. (AX 78; Tr. 5/27 at 86.) The intelligence briefings \nwere classified. (Tr. 5/27 at 92.) Although the game was terminated before there was a \nclear result, it was widely reported in the press that U.S. forces did not fare well. (AX 79; \nAX 80.) At least one nationally-distributed newspaper described it as a classified war \ngame. (AX 79 at 5.) At a reception at the embassy of the country whose military forces \nwere involved in the war game, Applicant joked with a senior intelligence official about \nthe press reports of the war game. The foreign official apparently thought Applicant \nplayed a key role in the games, and Applicant did not disabuse him of that notion. \nApplicant told the foreign official that if he ever was involved in a war game again and \nwas the head of the foreign team, he could make the foreign country win or lose. The \nforeign official laughed and responded that he should try to lose because his country \nloves peace. (GX 5 at 1; Tr. 5/26 300-03.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a polygraph examiner on October 29, 1996. The \npolygraph examiner testified that Applicant disagreed with the first draft of his sworn \nstatement, typed by the examiner after the first interview, because it was inaccurate. \n(Tr. 5/25 at 68.) The polygraph examiner testified that Applicant and his lawyer had an \n\u201cangry conversation\u201d about whether Applicant had admitted that the information was \nclassified. The lawyer believed Applicant had admitted that it was classified and \nApplicant denied admitting that the information was classified. (Tr. 5/25 at 95, 98-99.) At \nthe end of the interview, Applicant executed a sworn statement, but he refused to admit \nhe had divulged classified information. (GX 6; Tr. 5/25 at 106.) \n \n \nAccording to the lawyer, Applicant and he discussed that the occurrence of the \nwar game was unclassified and the scenario was unclassified, but the same information \n\u201cmight be potentially classifiable if mingled with war game outcome analysis.\u201d The \nlawyer testified that Applicant repeated that analysis in his oral statement to the \nexaminer. (Tr. 5/5 at 111-12; AX 139 at 9-10.) \n \n\n \n22 \n \n \nBecause Applicant refused to admit in writing that he had divulged classified \ninformation, the examiner submitted a separate memorandum with his report, stating: \n \nSubject provided the following information which he did not provide in a \nsworn statement: \n \nSubject advised that in 1994, he was an observer of a US Navy \u2013 [foreign \ncountry] war game. Later at a reception at the [foreign] embassy in 1995, \nSubject commented to [foreign] officials as to the results of the war game. \nSubject agreed that at least in part the war game was classified SECRET. \nHe also admitted that his remarks to the [foreign] officials were classified. \n \n(GX 7.)  \n \nThe polygraph examiner\u2019s \u201ctechnical report,\u201d which sets out the chronology of his \nactions to interview Applicant and conduct polygraph examinations, reflects that on \nNovember 15, 1996, Applicant and the examiner met at Applicant\u2019s request. At this \nmeeting, Applicant told the examiner that he did not want his lawyer present at the next \ninterview session because the lawyer \u201cyelled\u201d at him at the October 29 session. (AX 164 \nat 2.) \n \nApplicant was interviewed again by the same examiner on February 12, 1997, \nand submitted a sworn statement. The statement was typewritten, but with Applicant\u2019s \nhandwritten corrections and initials in several places. Applicant stated that he had been \ninterviewed by a reporter about the 1994 war game, and that he had been afraid ever \nsince the interview that what he had told the reporter about the war game might have \nbeen classified. (GX 5 at 1.) He also stated that because his research contracts require \naccess to foreign military officers, he \u201ctook a risk (of a security violation)\u201d at a reception \nat the foreign embassy in 1995 by joking with the foreign military official about the press \nreports concerning the war game. Applicant stated, \u201cThe game was partially classified \nSecret, so I have worried whether this joke was a security violation.\u201d (GX 5 at 1.) \n \n \nOn March 6, 1997, Applicant\u2019s lawyer wrote a letter to the polygraph examiner, \nstated that he was present during the entire interview, and told the examiner that his \nindependent recollection was that Applicant did not admit divulging classified \ninformation about the war game. (AX 83.) The examiner testified he did not recall \nreceiving the letter. (Tr. 5/25 at 124-25.) \n \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of a highly-qualified expert polygraph \nexaminer who has conducted more than 5,000 polygraph examinations and written \nextensively on the subject of polygraph examinations. The book authorized by the \nwitness was admitted in evidence (AX 166.) The book makes several observations \nrelevant to this case: \n \n\n \n23 \n \n \nAt page 8: Spending too much time on actually interrogating a subject \nabout a question during the pretest can sensitize a subject to a question \nand cause him to react to the question. \n \nAt page 9: Interrogations in the polygraph context come about when an \nexaminer believes that a subject is lying and elicitation fails to get an \nadmission. . . . If no admission is obtained, a call has to be made and \noften this call is deception indicated. \n \nAt page 168: [T]here was a perception growing among the examiners that \nunless they obtained an admission from a subject, they had not done their \njob. \n \nThe expert witness concludes his book with the revelation that he was denied a \nclearance at the end of a 31-year career. The denial was based on a polygraph \nexaminer\u2019s conclusion that he was concealing information about his book and that the \nresult of his polygraph examination was \u201cunresolved reactions to all issues,\u201d a \neuphemism for \u201cdeception indicated.\u201d AX 166 at 263. \n \nThe expert witness pointed out numerous flaws in the polygraph examination of \nApplicant. With respect to Applicant\u2019s purported admissions, the witness testified that \nhis practice and his agency\u2019s practice was to tape-record the polygraph interview, \npreserve the tapes forever, write down what the examinee says, and have the examinee \nverify the accuracy of the written statement. The failure of the examiner in this case to \nrecord the interview, preserve the recording, make a detailed record of exactly what was \nsaid during the interview, and review any admissions with the examinee were serious \nflaws. (Tr. 5/25 at 250-53) The witness also testified that in the polygraph community \nthere is a high premium on obtaining admissions. He testified that just as a baseball \nplayer gains approval from home runs, a polygraph examiner\u2019s stock in trade is getting \nadmissions. (Tr. 5/25 at 258.) Finally, he testified that Applicant \u201cdid everything wrong\u201d \nduring his examinations by talking too much and arguing with the examiner. (Tr. 5/25 at \n277.)  \n \n \nThe head of the agency that sponsored the war game testified that no part of the \nwar game was classified and that the results of the war game were not encouraging for \nthe U.S. He also reviewed the evidence of Applicant\u2019s joke and testified there was \nnothing classified or FOUO in Applicant\u2019s joking conversation with the foreign official. \n(Tr. 5/5 at 75-78.) \n \n \nUnlike much of the evidence in this case, the evidence regarding this SOR \nallegation is Applicant\u2019s own sworn statement, corrected and initialed by him. The \nevidence establishes that Applicant did not provide classified or sensitive information to \nthe newspaper reporter. It also establishes that he did not divulge any classified or \nsensitive information in his joke at the foreign embassy. It reinforces the evidence that \nApplicant is a worrier about security violations. However, it also establishes that \n\n \n24 \n \n \nApplicant was willing to risk a security violation to foster his relationship with the foreign \nintelligence official. His willingness to risk a security violation raises security concerns.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: In October 1996, Applicant deliberately withheld information \nconcerning his possible disclosure of classified information to foreign officials. \n \n \nIn his sworn statement of February 1997 (discussed above under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h \nand 2.a), Applicant disclosed that he had intentionally withheld information from the \npolygraph examiner before his polygraph examination in October 1996, \u201cbecause of the \noperational sensitivity, because they did not appear to me to be germane to a [redacted] \nbackground investigation.\u201d Applicant disclosed that he had been in contact with a \nforeign person with access to classified information in his native country, but who did \nnot appear to be an intelligence officer and never showed any interest in obtaining \nclassified information from him. Applicant also disclosed that he strongly suspected, \nbased on eyewitness information, that a U.S. government unclassified contract was \nbeing manipulated by two U.S. citizens and a foreign think tank to provide current \nclassified U.S. government information to an intelligence organization in that foreign \ncountry. (GX 5 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to withhold this information was based on his understanding \nof advice from his lawyer. His lawyer at the time was concerned that questioning about \ncounterintelligence concerns could risk harm to Applicant when he traveled abroad and \ncould put at risk classified projects within the DOD. The lawyer testified that he advised \nApplicant not to needlessly disclose foreign contacts that had been fully authorized, \nbecause it could jeopardize U.S. Government national security policy and his personal \nsafety abroad. The agency conducting the interviews did not have jurisdiction over \ncounterintelligence matters, and Applicant\u2019s counsel did not think it appropriate for that \nagency to inquire about some of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts that had been authorized \nby the U.S. Government. (Tr. 5/5 at 121-24; AX 139 at 13-14.) Applicant\u2019s lawyer was \nexperienced in national security law and was the same security consultant who had \nadvised Applicant\u2019s supervisor about controlling contacts with the press, discussed \nabove under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 2.a. \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant withheld information from a polygraph \nexaminer on the advice of an experienced national security lawyer. The security \nimplications of his conduct are discussed below in the \u201cAnalysis\u201d section of this \ndecision. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 2.a: In 1975, Applicant failed to properly safeguard a classified \ndocument in his personal residence and failed to appropriately safeguard it until \nsurrendering it to security personnel. \n \n \nIn 1975, while employed by a defense contractor, Applicant wrote a seven-page \nunclassified report based on open-source materials. At the suggestion of a government \nofficial, he took his report to his classified work place, added some references to \nclassified materials to back up his opinions, and placed classified markings on the \n\n \n25 \n \n \ndocument. The classified document was then transmitted to a government agency. \nApplicant\u2019s employer did not retain a copy of the classified version. (GX 42 at 158-66.) \n \n \nIn October 1999, in response to a broad, open-ended question whether he had \never mishandled classified information, Applicant told a polygraph examiner that he \nfound his unclassified draft of the document in 1984 or 1986, while cleaning out some \npersonal files at home. (GX 42 at 169.) According to the polygraph examiner\u2019s summary \nof the interview, Applicant did not return the document to the government agency, \u201cdue \nto his own procrastination.\u201d (GX 24 at 18.) \n \nA few days before the October 1999 interview, Applicant took his draft to his \ngovernment office within the DOD, confirmed that his draft was unclassified, and then \npresented the title page (containing no classification markings) to the polygraph \nexaminer. (GX 42 at 170.) The summary of the polygraph examiner\u2019s interview referred \nto the document as \u201cthe aforementioned draft paper now classified secret.\u201d (GX 24 at \n18.)  \n \nIn a DOHA interview in September 2009, he stated that he did not present the \nentire seven-page document to the polygraph examiner because he did not think the \nexaminer wanted it, and the examiner seemed to accept the fact that the document was \nnot classified. (GX 42 at 172.) Applicant admitted he was na\u00efve to think that the \npolygraph examiner would \u201cget it right.\u201d (GX 42 at 175.) Applicant later asserted that the \nexaminer made no effort to obtain the document and have it reviewed. (GX 22 at 8.) \nNeither the classified nor the unclassified documents were submitted in evidence. \nApplicant believes the classified version was destroyed. (GX 22 at 8; GX 42 at 175, 178; \nTr. 5/26 at 321-28.) \n \n \nTwo senior DOD officials submitted affidavits stating that they would have been \nnotified immediately and conducted an investigation if Applicant had turned in a \nclassified report that he had been storing at home. They both stated that they received \nno such reports. (AX 138 at 3; AX 170 at 1.) \n \n \nThe evidence supporting this allegation came entirely from Applicant. His \ntestimony is exculpatory, and there is no evidence contradicting it. What is puzzling is \nwhy Applicant cited this incident in response to a question whether he had ever \nmishandled classified information, and then described it in totally exculpatory terms. The \npolygraph examiner filled in the evidentiary gaps with conjecture. Applicant\u2019s response \nis consistent with his reputation among some former colleagues for having an \n\u201cexcruciating conscience.\u201d I conclude that this allegation is not supported by substantial \nevidence. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 2.a: In October or November 1999, Applicant provided sensitive or \nclassified information to an uncleared Senate legislative assistant.  \n \n \nIn the spring of 1999, Applicant visited an overseas U.S. military command as a \nspecial government employee of the DOD, during which he was briefed on the U.S. \n\n \n26 \n \n \nability to defend its allies in the region. In May 1999, a recently retired senior officer from \nthat command was nominated to be an ambassador to one of the countries in the \nregion. In October 1999, a Senate staffer, who had known Applicant personally and \nprofessionally for about 15 years, asked Applicant about the nominee. She also asked a \nnumber of her fellow staffers what they knew about the nominee. (Tr. 5/26 at 42.) \nApplicant had completed his tour of duty as a special government employee at the end \nof June 1999, and he was working as a contractor for DOD. (AX 159.) Applicant \nexpressed the view that the nominee was \u201ctoo soft\u201d on certain policy issues, and he \nadvised the staffer to \u201cuse the media in order to fish for answers.\u201d He told her there \nmight be some disagreements within the military about the nominee\u2019s views, and that \nshe should investigate that possibility. (Tr. 5/26 at 75.) Applicant also gave the staffer a \ncopy of the book he had published regarding the country involved, but he did not give \nher any other written materials. (Tr. 5/26 at 45; AX 160.) Both Applicant and the staffer \ntestified that the documents and the information given by Applicant were unclassified. \n(Tr. 5/26 at 48, 341-48; GX 42 at 194.)  \n \n \nThe testimony of the staffer and Applicant is consistent with the summary of a \npolygraph interview of Applicant regarding the incident. The summary recites that \nApplicant admitted providing \u201clead information\u201d to the staffer (GX 24 at 35.) In other \nwords, he admitted during the polygraph interview that he told the staffer where to look \nfor the information she needed. \n \nThe staffer drafted an editorial for her Senator, which appeared in a local \nnewspaper. The staffer testified she did not remember Applicant playing a significant \nrole in writing the editorial, because she considered herself a good writer. She testified \nshe might have shared the editorial with Applicant after she drafted it, because she \nthought she had done a good job writing it. (Tr. 5/26 at 79-80.)  \n \nThe Senator\u2019s staff requested a number of documents from DOD, but the staffer \nwith whom Applicant talked did not play a major role in compiling the request for \ndocuments. (Tr. 5/26 at 67-68.) The Senator placed a hold on the nomination pending \nrelease and consideration of the documents requested from DOD. (GX 36.) Six days \nlater, the hold was lifted and the nominee was confirmed by the Senate. (HX LXIV.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor in DOD asked him if he was involved in any way in the \neditorial, and Applicant responded, \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d In the September 2009 DOHA \ninterview, Applicant explained that by \u201cguilty as charged\u201d he meant that his opinion was \nreflected in the editorial and that he had talked to the staffer about the nomination. (GX \n42 at 142-43; Tr. 5/26 at 353.) Applicant\u2019s supervisor has no recollection of confronting \nApplicant about a leak investigation and no recollection of Applicant saying he was \n\u201cguilty as charged.\u201d His supervisor also opined that he saw nothing wrong with Applicant \ndiscussing U.S. foreign policy with a Senate staffer or providing information from his \npublic writings as a private citizen. (Tr. 5/5 at 79; AX 138 at 4.) \n \nApplicant testified that there was no connection between the military briefing and \nthe DOD documents requested by the Senator, because the briefing did not involve the \n\n \n27 \n \n \nissues addressed by the requested documents. However, the military commander \nexpressing concern about a possible leak knew that Applicant had been involved in the \nissues addressed in the requested documents for more than 10 years. (Tr. 5/27 at 79-\n81.)  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant divulged the content of the briefings he \nreceived from the overseas command. There is no evidence that Applicant used the \ncontent of those briefings to suggest questions or source material to the staffer. \nAlthough the nomination for an ambassadorship was politically sensitive, there is no \nevidence that Applicant disclosed any information that was national-security sensitive. \nDepartment Counsel argued that Applicant breached his duty as a special government \nemployee by undermining the President\u2019s nominee for an ambassadorship, but \nApplicant had completed his tour of duty as a special government employee when the \nconversation occurred. Applicant\u2019s supervisor, a senior political appointee, was not \nconcerned about the conversation. I conclude that Applicant has rebutted this \nallegation.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n28 \n \n \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nIn my findings of fact set out above, I found that Applicant rebutted several \nallegations that were resolved against him in previous adjudications. Federal agencies \nare required to give reciprocal recognition to each other\u2019s security clearance \nadjudications. See National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), \nDOD 5220.22-M, February 28, 2006, \u00b6 2-204; Department of Defense (DOD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), \u00b6\u00b6 C4.1.1, C4.1.2, and C4.1.4. However, there is no requirement that each \nfinding of fact by another agency be accepted at face value by every other agency. \nReciprocity is a rule of government economy, designed to avoid duplicative \ninvestigations and adjudications, but it is not a rule of estoppel. See ISCR Case No. 06-\n10859 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 2, 2010), citing ISCR Case No. 07-00260 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nJan. 24, 2008). \n \n \nI noted that Applicant received his last security clearance in January 1997, after \nall the events alleged in the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l. It is well-established \nthat granting a clearance does not estop the Government from making a subsequent \nadverse decision. See ISCR Case No. 08-05344 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 3, 2010) and cases \ncited therein.  \n \n \nI also noted that several adverse adjudications based on events alleged in the \nSOR occurred before the Supreme Court decision in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), on which our current due-process requirements are founded. \nFinally, I noted that the adverse SCI adjudications did not afford Applicant the due-\n\n \n29 \n \n \nprocess protections that are the currently provided in the Directive and Intelligence \nCommunity Directive No 704 and Intelligence Community Policy Guidance No. 704.1, \n704.2, and 704.3. As a result, his ability to test the evidence against him was more \nlimited than it was in his hearing before me. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nIn my findings of fact, I resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l, and the \ncorresponding Guideline K allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor, because he presented \nsufficient evidence to rebut those allegations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. I concluded that \nsufficient evidence was presented in support of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, and 1.i to raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition raised by SOR \u00b6 1.i, alleging that Applicant \ndeliberately withheld relevant and material information during an interview by a security \ninvestigator, is AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative\u201d). When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) \nApplicant admitted withholding information from the investigator, based on advice \nfrom his lawyer. His admission is sufficient evidence to raise this disqualifying condition, \nshifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on false or misleading answers may be mitigated under \nAG \u00b6 17(b) if: \n \n[T]he refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n\n \n30 \n \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.   \nThis mitigating condition is established. Applicant withheld information during his \ninterview in October 1996 on advice of counsel, but he provided complete information \nduring a follow-up interview in February 1997. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions pertaining to Applicant\u2019s withholding of \ninformation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, as well as the manifestations of poor judgment in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h, are as follows: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged that that Applicant disclosed classified information, but the \nevidence did not support that allegation. The Government argued that some of the \ninformation disclosed by Applicant was FOUO, but several senior-level witnesses \ntestified that the FOUO designation did not exist at the time of the conduct alleged. \nNevertheless, these witnesses testified that the information disclosed by Applicant was \nnot \u201csensitive.\u201d The FOUO designation is mentioned in the 1982, 1986, and 1989 \nversions of DOD 5200.1-R, but it is not defined. The definition of FOUO first appeared in \nDOD 5200.1-R in 1997, after most of the conduct alleged in the SOR.6  \n \n \nFinally, the Government argued that Applicant\u2019s conduct violated the standards \nof ethics for Government officers and employees. At the Government\u2019s request, I took \n                                                          \n6 Army Regulations used the FOUO designation and defined the limits on disclosure of FOUO information \nas early as the 1960s. See Silverthorne v. Laird, 460 F.2d 1175 (1972) (discussing the requirement in \nArmy Regulation 340-16 to prohibit public disclosure of a FOUO document executed in 1971); United \nStates v. Franchia, 13 U.S.C.M.A 315, 32 C.M.R 315 (1962) (discussing directive of the Secretary of the \nArmy to treat a document created before 1962 as FOUO). The record does not reflect whether the FOUO \ndesignation was used in all the military departments before 1982. \n\n \n31 \n \n \nadministrative notice of Executive Order (E.O.) 11222, May 8, 1965; E.O. 12674, April \n1, 1989 (revoking E.O 11222); 5 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) \u00a7\u00a7 2635.101, \n2635.102, and 2635.703; and 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b). \n \n \nE.O. 11222 was in effect when the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g occurred. \nThree provisions applied to all government employees and are potentially relevant to \nthis case:  \n \nSec. 202. An employee shall not engage in any outside employment, \nincluding teaching, lecturing, or writing, which might result in a conflict, or \nan apparent conflict, between the private interests of the employee and his \nofficial duties and responsibilities, although such teaching, lecturing, and \nwriting by employees are generally to be encouraged so long as the laws, \nthe provisions of this order, and the Civil Service Commission and agency \nregulations covering conflict of interest and outside employment are \nobserved. \n \nSec. 203. Employees may not (a) have direct or indirect financial interests \nthat conflict substantially, or appear to conflict substantially, with their \nresponsibilities and duties as Federal employees, or (b) engage in, directly \nor indirectly, financial transactions as a result of, or primarily relying upon, \ninformation obtained through their employment.  \n \nSection 205. An employee shall not directly or indirectly make use of, or \npermit others to make use of, for the purpose of furthering a private \ninterest, official information not made available to the general public. \n \n \nSpecial government employees were subject to different rules, of which the \nfollowing are potentially relevant to this case: \n \n \nSec. 302. A consultant, advisor or other special Government employee \nmust refrain from any use of his public office which is motivated by, or \ngives the appearance of being motivated by, the desire for private gain for \nhimself or other persons, including particularly those with whom he has \nfamily, business, or financial ties. \n \n \nSec. 303. A consultant, advisor, or other special Government employee \nshall not use any inside information obtained as a result of his government \nservice for private personal gain, either by direct action on his part or by \ncounsel, recommendations, or suggestions to others, including particularly \nthose with whom he has family, business, or financial ties. \n \n \nSec. 304. An advisor, consultant, or other special Government employee \nshall not use his position in any way to coerce, or give the appearance of \ncoercing, another person to provide any financial benefit to him or persons \nwith whom he has family, business, or financial ties. \n\n \n32 \n \n \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l occurred after the issuance of E.O \n12674, which repealed E.O. 11222. The ethical principles for Government employees \nannounced in E.O. 12674 were implemented by 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.101.  The implementing \nregulations provide the same rules for full-time permanent government employees and \nspecial government employees. As defined in 5 CFR \u00a7 2635.102(h), \u201cemployee\u201d \nincludes a special government employee. The following principles are potentially \nrelevant to this case: \n \n\u00a7 2635.101(b)(2): Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict \nwith conscientious performance of duty; \n \n\u00a7 2636.101(b)(3): Employees shall not engage in financial transactions \nusing nonpublic Government information or allowing the improper use of \nsuch information to further any private interest; \n \n\u00a7 2636.101(b)(7): Employees shall not use public office for private gain;  \n \n\u00a7 2636.101(b)(14): Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions \ncreating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical \nstandards set forth in this part; and \n \n\u00a7 2635.703(b): An employee shall not engage in a financial transaction \nusing nonpublic information, nor allow the improper use of nonpublic \ninformation to further his own private interest or that of another, whether \nthrough advice or recommendation, or by knowing unauthorized \ndisclosure. \n \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) defines \u201cnonpublic information\u201d as: \n \n \n[I]nformation that the employee gains by reason of Federal employment \nand that he knows or reasonably should know has not been made \navailable to the general public. It includes information that he knows or \nreasonably should know: (1) is routinely exempt from disclosure under 5 \nU.S.C. 522 or otherwise protected from disclosure by statute, Executive \norder or regulation; (2) is designated as confidential by an agency; and (3) \nhas not actually been disseminated to the general public and is not \nauthorized to be made available to the public on request. \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose any classified information to unauthorized recipients. \nHowever, the Government argued that Applicant disclosed \u201csensitive\u201d information. \n\u201cSensitive\u201d information is not further defined in Guidelines E or K. However, Appendix 3 \nof DOD 5200.1-R, January 1997, discusses \u201ccontrolled unclassified information\u201d and \ndefines it as including FOUO information, \u201csensitive but unclassified\u201d information \n(formerly \u201climited official use\u201d), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sensitive \ninformation, and \u201csensitive information,\u201d as defined in the Computer Security Act of \n1987. I conclude that the term \u201csensitive information encompasses all the categories of \n\n \n33 \n \n \n\u201ccontrolled unclassified information\u201d defined in DOD 5200.1-R. It also includes \n\u201cnonpublic information\u201d as defined in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b) and referred to in 5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 \n2636.101(b)(3) and 2635.703(b).7 \n \n \nThe Government was unable to produce substantial evidence that any \ninformation disclosed by Applicant was \u201ccontrolled unclassified information\u201d \u201csensitive \ninformation,\u201d or \u201cnonpublic information.\u201d When Applicant discussed the pending \nnomination of an ambassador with a Senate staffer, he was a consultant, not an \nemployee of the executive branch, and he was not subject to the ethical standards for \ngovernment employees. However, there is no evidence that he disclosed any protected \ninformation or acted to advance his private interests or those of another when he \ndiscussed the ambassadorial nomination with the staffer.  \n \n \nExcept for the joke with a foreign intelligence official about the results of the war \ngame, the Government also was unable to produce substantial evidence that Applicant \nacted for private gain. He admitted that the joke about the war game was motivated in \npart by his interest in fostering foreign connections for his personal scholarship and \nconsulting business. However, the content of the joke was unclassified, widely reported \nin the newspapers, and does not qualify as \u201cnonpublic information.\u201d In all other \ninstances alleged in the SOR where \u201cnonpublic information\u201d was disclosed, it was done \nto further a legitimate political or governmental interest, and not for private gain or to \nfurther the private interests of Applicant or anyone else. \n \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s careless security practices, demonstrated by the facts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h, and his lack of good judgment, demonstrated by the \nfacts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, are established by his admissions. Based on those \nadmissions, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d) are established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). No classified \nor sensitive information was disclosed. Applicant\u2019s dereliction was in failing to ensure \nthat the information was not classified before he divulged it. He knew he was walking a \nfine line, and he risked an inadvertent security violation. Negligent conduct that risks \nserious harm to national security is not \u201cminor.\u201d In this context, I conclude that the first \nprong of this mitigating condition (\u201cso minor\u201d) is not established.  \n \n \nThe second prong of this mitigating condition (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) \nfocuses on whether the conduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for \ndetermining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without \n                                                          \n7 It is possible that Guideline K was also intended to protect other information such as a contractor\u2019s \nproprietary information or information that would be privileged under Fed. R. Evid. 501, but those kinds of \ninformation are not at issue in this case. \n\n \n34 \n \n \nany evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c occurred when Applicant was 32-33 \nyears old, while he was employed by a defense contractor that strongly encouraged \nmedia exposure and high publicity, and before his employment by the DOD. The \nconduct with the foreign intelligence official, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, occurred in 1995, \nfifteen years ago. Applicant was granted a clearance in January 1997, after the 1995 \nincident, and served in various responsible positions until March 2003. I conclude that \nthe second prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) is established.  \n \n \nThe third prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe behavior is so infrequent\u201d) is not established \nbecause there were multiple instances of careless security practices. The fourth prong \n(unique circumstances) is not established because the events occurred in the ordinary \ncourse of Applicant\u2019s employment.  \n \n \nBased on all the evidence, however, the final prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cdoes not cast \ndoubt\u201d) is established. The record is replete with testimonials from high-level officials to \nhis current integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness. These officials worked with \nApplicant after the 1995 incident. Accordingly, I conclude that the mitigating condition in \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct also may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). After his embarrassing dismissal from a high-\nlevel position in 1986, Applicant sought psychiatric counseling, beginning in 1988 and \ncontinuing until the present. His psychiatrist believes that his depression, irritability, and \ninsensitivity to others have been successfully treated with psychotherapy and \nmedication. During the last ten years, he has taken several steps to reduce the \nstressors in his life. At the hearing, he demonstrated a positive attitude about protecting \nclassified and sensitive information. His experiences with polygraph examinations and \nmultiple denials of applications for clearances have chastened him, made him more \ncautious about handling classified information, and made him wary of contacts with the \nmedia. I conclude that the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(d) is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201c(e) the \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). For the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nAG \u00b6 17(d), I conclude that this mitigating condition also is established. \n \n\n \n35 \n \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h was cross-alleged under this \nguideline. The security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to \ncomply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information \nraises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness \nand ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant challenged the application of Guideline K to his case, arguing that the \namendment of the guideline to encompass \u201csensitive\u201d information violated the Ex Post \nFacto Clause of Article I, Section 10, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution. I have rejected \nhis Constitutional challenge, because the overwhelming weight of legal authority holds \nthat the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to civil or regulatory law, including \nindustrial security clearance hearings. See ISCR Case No. 03-09412, 2004 WL \n2896760 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2004) and cases cited therein. \n \nSecurity violations are one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or \nrevoking access to classified information, as they raise very serious questions about an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Once it is established that an \napplicant has committed a security violation, he or she has a very heavy burden of \ndemonstrating that he or she should be entrusted with classified information. Because \nsecurity violations strike at the very heart of the industrial security program, an \nadministrative judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation strict scrutiny. In \nmany security clearance cases, applicants are denied a clearance for having an \nindicator of a risk that they might commit a security violation (e.g., alcohol abuse, \ndelinquent debts, or drug use). Security violation cases reveal more than simply an \nindicator of risk. ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006).The frequency and \nduration of the security violations are also aggravating factors. ISCR Case No. 97-0435 \nat 5 (App. Bd. July 14, 1998).  \n \nHowever, there were no security violations in this case. For the reasons set out in \nthe above discussion of Guideline E, I conclude that Applicant rebutted the allegations \nthat he disclosed classified or sensitive information to unauthorized persons. His poor \njudgment in risking a security violation is covered by Guideline E, as discussed above. I \nconclude that no disqualifying conditions under Guideline K are raised by the evidence. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \n\n \n36 \n \n \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and K in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) have already been addressed, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is well-educated, mature, intelligent, and articulate. During the hearing, \nhe displayed some of the intensity for which he is well known, but he was candid, and \nsincere. His testimony was plausible and credible. He displayed the loquacity observed \nby his polygraph expert. At times he was didactic and pedantic. He tended to carefully \nparse each question, dividing it into individual words and phrases before answering. \nAfter observing his demeanor, reviewing his testimony, and considering his personality, \nhis experience in contentious political assignments, and the situations in which he was \nserving several masters, I found it unsurprising that he was often blamed for leaks, \nmisunderstood, or accused of disloyalty. I was impressed by the ringing endorsements \nhe has received from highly respected senior officers, past and present.  \n \n \nI have also considered that the earliest allegations against Applicant are more \nthan 30 years old and the most recent are 15 years old. Applicant is no longer the \nbrash, hard-charging Senate staffer, nor is he the 50-year-old self-promoting consultant \nwho reveled in his ability to move in foreign intelligence circles with ease. He is now a \n65-year-old scholar, mellowed and clearly chastened by his experiences with the \nsecurity clearance process. \n \n \nI have considered the allegations individually and as a whole to determine \nwhether the record as a whole leaves me with doubts about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \nreliability, and good judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline E, evaluating Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline K, evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation to resolve \nclose cases in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns based on his personal conduct and rebutted the allegations based on his \nhandling of protected information. I am satisfied that Applicant\u2019s personal conduct was \nmitigated under Guideline E as well as the whole-person concept. See ISCR Case No. \n09-05655 at 2. (App. Bd. Aug. 24, 2010). Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n37 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings regarding the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a  \n \n \nFor Applicant (withdrawn) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant (withdrawn) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On December 16, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\n\nThe Judge appropriately cited ISCR Case No. 03-20327 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) as authority for his\n1\nconclusion that incidents or evidence not covered by the SOR could be used for limited purposes. \n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 24, 2009 after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge\u2019s consideration of a\nMarch 2003 incident as a security violation establishing a pattern of rules violations was error; and\n(b) whether the Judge erred in not basing his decision on the whole person concept.  For the\nfollowing reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found, inter alia, that while on active duty with the military in March 2003\nApplicant prepared a briefing for military and civilian attendees that contained Special Access\nProgram (SAP) information.  Not all attendees were cleared for SAP information.  Applicant\nadmitted he had not submitted his briefing for classification review before it was presented.\nApplicant was counseled but was allowed to retain his clearance and SCI eligibility.\nThe Judge concluded that the 2003 incident was a security violation and that, taken in\nconjunction with other incidents alleged in the SOR, it formed part of a pattern of rules violations.\nThe Judge acknowledged that the March 2003 security violation was not alleged in the SOR.\nHowever, he noted that conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant\u2019s\ncredibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence\nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has\ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole person analysis.  The Judge stated that\nhe was considering the March 2003 incident for these limited purposes.\nApplicant asserts: (i) the March 2003 incident was not in the SOR; (ii) the incident resulted\nin no compromise of classified material, no formal action was taken against him and no verbal\nreprimand was issued; (iii) his failure to obtain a review of the briefing beforehand was not a\nviolation of existing policy; (iv) the cognizant authority at the time determined that the incident was\nnot a security violation.  Applicant argues that the March 2003 incident led the Judge to deny his\nrequest for a security clearance.\nA review of the record convinces the Board that there was substantial evidence to support\nthe Judge\u2019s characterization of the March 2003 incident as a \u201csecurity violation.\u201d  The record also\nreasonably supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the incident was part of a pattern of rules violations.\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s suggestion that the Judge used the March 2003 incident improperly as the\nbasis for his adverse security clearance decision, the Judge correctly noted in his decision that the\nMarch 2003 incident could be used for limited purposes.   He stated that he considered the incident\n1\nonly for those limited purposes.  There is a presumption in favor of regularity and good faith on the\n\n3\npart of DOHA Judges as they engage in the process of deciding cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0019 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 1999).  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision and his use of the March 2003\nincident convinces the Board that this presumption has not been overcome, and that the Judge used\nthe evidence for the limited purposes stated.\nApplicant points to the favorable aspects of his service to the military and the government\nin asserting that the Judge erroneously concentrated on a three year period of 2003-2006, instead of\nconsidering his entire career.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding several allegations under Guideline\nB and one allegation under Guideline E.  However, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient\nevidence to mitigate the Guideline B allegations relating to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife\n(who is a citizen of and has ties to Thailand) and to mitigate the remaining Guideline E allegations\nrelating to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.\nAfter considering the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis\ncomplies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1 in that the Judge considered the totality of\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  See, ISCR Case No. 05-03948 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May\n21, 2007). \nFurthermore, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief does not specifically address the Judge\u2019s adverse\nfindings under Guideline B.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign \nInfluence) and E (Personal Conduct), based on Applicant\u2019s marriage to an officer in the \nRoyal Thai Air Force while holding a security clearance and eligibility for access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). Applicant\u2019s security clearance and SCI \neligibility were revoked in October 2006. Applicant now seeks reinstatement of his \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on July 30, 2007. On December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines B \nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \nApril 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 23, 2008; answered it on January 8, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on January 12, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n5, 2009; and the case was assigned to me on February 12, 2009. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on February 18, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 17, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented \nthe testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, \nwhich were admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the \nhearing on March 17, 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 25, 2009. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Thailand, and Applicant did not object. The request and its enclosures are \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. The facts administratively noticed are \nset out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR. \nHis admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He held a security \nclearance and SCI eligibility from about November 1977 to October 2006. He served as \nan officer in the U.S. Navy from October 1975 to October 2003, and he retired as a \ncommander (pay grade O-5) (Tr. 70). He holds a master\u2019s degree from the Naval \nPostgraduate School (Tr. 7). During his Navy career, he served in numerous \nintelligence-related assignments, and he worked with the intelligence community as a \ncivilian contractor employee until October 2006 (Tr. 34-36). \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 1980 to a citizen of the United Kingdom. They \nwere divorced in October 2003. Applicant has one adult daughter from this marriage (Tr. \n46). He held a clearance and SCI eligibility even though his spouse was not a U.S. \ncitizen (Tr. 34, 82).  \n \n \nIn March 2003, while Applicant was still on active duty, he prepared a briefing for \nmilitary and civilian attendees that contained Special Access Program (SAP) \ninformation. All attendees had top secret/SCI clearances, but not all were cleared for \nSAP information. Applicant admitted he had not submitted his briefing for a classification \nreview before it was presented. He attributed this violation to job-related stress (GX 9 at \n13). He was counseled but was allowed to retain his clearance and SCI eligibility (GX 9 \nat 18).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nIn August 2003, while in the U.S. Navy but assigned to an intelligence agency, \nApplicant signed a \u201cPersonnel Security Policy Advisory.\u201d This document informed him, \nin pertinent part, as follows: \n \nCasual associations with foreign nationals are generally acceptable. Such \nassociations must not, however, develop into \u201cclose and continuing\u201d \nrelationships, e.g., those characterized by ties of kinship, obligation \n(including financial), affection, or other capacities to influence. Such \nrelationships are not compatible with the security of [the agency\u2019s] \nsensitive mission. Affiliates who find themselves involved in such a \nrelationship must immediately seek guidance from a security officer. \n \n(GX 9, Enclosure 13.) \n \n \nIn May 2004, while traveling in Thailand on business for his employer and while \nholding a security clearance and SCI eligibility, Applicant met a female officer in the \nRoyal Thai Air Force. She speaks fluent English, has attended a U.S. Army school for \nautomation officers, and held a U.S. security clearance while attending the training (Tr. \n71). Applicant reported this foreign contact to his security officer (Tr. 38, 62).  \n \nAfter returning to the U.S., Applicant maintained email contact with the Thai \nofficer about once a week, and their relationship developed into a friendship. He visited \nher in Thailand for about ten days in January 2005, and she visited him for five days in \nthe U.S. during February 2005. Before traveling to Thailand, Applicant filed the required \nreport of foreign travel and listed the Thai officer as a foreign contact (Tr. 38). After he \nreturned from Thailand, he informed his employer\u2019s security officer as well as a \ngovernment employee who was the security officer for the project on which he was \nworking that he and the Thai officer had become \u201cmuch closer\u201d and had discussed \nmarriage (Tr. 38-39, 64).  \n \n \nThe Thai officer visited Applicant for five days in the U.S. during February 2005 \nand attended training in the U.S. She returned to Thailand in July 2005. By this time, \nshe and Applicant had decided to be married after she retired in October 2006 (Tr. 39, \n80). \n \n \nApplicant underwent a polygraph examination in April 2005, in connection with an \napplication for government employment. The polygraph examiner informed him that his \nforeign contacts had not been reported to the appropriate government official by his \nemployer. Applicant completed the required reports the next day (Tr. 39). \n \n \nApplicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) in November 2005 in \nwhich he disclosed his romantic relationship with the Thai officer. He stated the Thai \nofficer intended to retire in 2006, after which they intended to marry and live together in \nthe U.S., and that she intended to seek U.S. citizenship (GX 9 at Encl 14, p. 11).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn late 2005, Applicant was offered a government position. At this point, he was \nstill employed by a government contractor but preparing to accept a position as a \ngovernment employee. In early January 2006, he was informed that a compelling need \nstatement was required for his future government position because of his relationship \nwith a foreign national. He drafted the document, which recited his marriage plans, and \ntook it to the government security officer (Tr. 40). The document was transmitted to the \ndeputy commander of the activity for which Applicant would be working, who had \nauthority to sign it. Applicant testified he watched the deputy commander sign it (Tr. 67-\n68). He testified he told the deputy commander he intended to be married during his trip \nto Thailand in January 2006 (Tr. 77), but this information about the intended date of \nmarriage apparently was not reduced to writing. Applicant and his fianc\u00e9e had decided \nto be married in Thailand, because they concluded that the fianc\u00e9e visa process was \ntoo complicated and time-consuming. Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel \nproduced a copy of the compelling need statement at the hearing, but the fact that it \nwas drafted and submitted was corroborated by one of Applicant\u2019s colleagues (AX A). \n \n \nAfter the compelling need statement was signed, Applicant traveled to Thailand, \nfiling the required trip report beforehand. He was married on January 13, 2006 (Tr. 40). \nUpon returning to the U.S. a few days later, he was summoned to meet with a \ncounterintelligence officer. He informed the counterintelligence officer of his recent \nmarriage, and was told, \u201cYou should have talked to us first.\u201d Applicant testified he then \nrealized that more than a compelling need statement was required (Tr. 41; GX 9 at Encl \n8, p. 2). He testified that he was aware of the requirement for a compelling need \nstatement, but was unaware of the requirement for a foreign spouse waiver until his \nmeeting with the counterintelligence officer (Tr. 69).  \n \nApplicant had previous experience with a compelling need statement, because \nhe needed one for a Navy assignment in 2001, when he was married to his previous \nwife, a citizen of the United Kingdom (Tr. 72). He testified he believed, based on his \nexperience, that the person for whom a compelling need statement is submitted is not \ngiven a copy of it and does not receive written approval. He testified he believed \napproval is indicated by granting access to the work space and programs for which SCI \nclearance is required (Tr. 73-74). Finally, he testified that he assumed it was permissible \nfor him to be married after the deputy commander signed the compelling need \nstatement (Tr. 75).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s access to SCI was suspended in late January 2006 and revoked in \nOctober 2006, along with his collateral security clearance (Tr. 9; GX 7, 8). His appeal of \nthe revocation was supported by several senior civilian officials, but it was denied in \nMay 2007 (GX 9 at 3). The decision memorandum (GX 9 at 18) recites that Applicant \n\u201cdemonstrated irresponsible behavior and disregard for [agency] policies\u201d by marrying a \nforeign national, without the agency\u2019s knowledge or consent and \u201cin knowing and \ndeliberate violation\u201d of its policies. The decision memorandum concludes: \u201cHis marriage \nmakes him ineligible to hold SCI access; his calculated decision to violate [agency] \npolicy raises questions about his willingness and ability to safeguard [agency] \ninformation.\u201d  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was unable to retire as she had planned, because all retirements \nwere cancelled after the military coup in Thailand. Applicant visited her in Thailand in \nJanuary 2007. She retired in April 2007 and came to the U.S. in July 2007 (Tr. 42). She \nis now a permanent resident of the U.S. (AX C). She receives about $1,200 in monthly \nretirement pay from the Thai government that she uses to support her son, who is a \ncitizen and resident of Thailand (Tr. 52). She owns a condominium in downtown \nBangkok that she is trying to sell, and some undeveloped oceanfront property (Tr. 52-\n53). Her son sometimes resides in the condominium (Tr. 53).  \n \nApplicant testified his wife intends to become a U.S. citizen. Her son, who is a \nstudent in Thailand, has received an immigrant visa and is awaiting a quota from the \nU.S. Department of State (AX D; Tr. 30, 49-50). Applicant\u2019s contact with his wife\u2019s son is \nlimited to courtesy greetings when she calls him (Tr. 43). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was previously married to an officer in the Royal Thai Air Force, \nwho has since retired (Tr. 43). Applicant has never met him, and his wife has no contact \nwith her ex-husband (Tr. 43, 57). \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a sister who lives in Germany (Tr. 48) and brother who is a \nmid-level employee of the Thai government. Applicant has never met her brother (Tr. \n43). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Thailand, residing in the \nBangkok area. Applicant\u2019s contact with her is limited by the language barrier (Tr. 43). He \ndoes not know if she ever worked outside the home. Her husband is deceased (Tr. 48). \nApplicant\u2019s wife talks to her mother by telephone three or four times a week (Tr. 50). \n \nA long-time colleague of Applicant, who is now a senior government employee in \nthe intelligence community, submitted a letter supporting Applicant\u2019s application for a \nclearance. He described Applicant as a \u201cconsummate professional, fully committed to \nthe security of the nation and his fellows, and diligently observant of all security \nregulations and policies.\u201d He stated that Applicant enjoys a reputation in the intelligence \ncommunity as a \u201chighly skilled professional; consistent, dedicated, diligent, an adherent \nto the letter of the law and policy, and fully committed to the security of this nation.\u201d He \nwas familiar with Applicant\u2019s marital situation. He stated that Applicant informed his \nsuperiors of his intended marriage and waited until the compelling need statement was \ncompleted, but was unaware of the requirement to wait for a foreign spouse waiver (AX \nA). This witness was present when Applicant drafted the compelling need statement for \nhis superiors, and he was later present when Applicant was escorted out of the facility \nfor not completing the appropriate paperwork regarding his marriage (Tr. 46). \n \n \nA former supervisor serving in a senior executive service position also supported \nApplicant. He stated, \u201cI can categorically say that I continue to see [Applicant] as a \ntrusted advisor, a person whose sound judgment, personal character, integrity and \nloyalty is beyond reproach.\u201d He noted that many of Applicant\u2019s accomplishments cannot \n\n \n6 \n \n \nbe fully divulged, but that he has had a lasting impact on the national security of the \nUnited States (AX B). \n \n \nA U.S. Navy captain with 24 years of service and a top secret clearance, for \nwhom Applicant worked for nine months as an executive assistant, testified he regards \nApplicant as trustworthy and was considering him for a position in his organization (Tr. \n87-88). A retired Navy captain now working in a high-level intelligence position as a \ncivilian, who has known and worked with Applicant with 1993, testified in support of his \napplication for a clearance. He regards Applicant as absolutely trustworthy (Tr. 99). This \nwitness also testified that the intelligence threat level from Thailand is low (Tr. 98). \nFinally, he testified that the intelligence threat level posed by a foreign spouse is less \nwhen the spouse is a military officer, because the activities of military officers usually \nare more visible that those of civilians (Tr. 108).  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice that Thailand is a constitutional monarchy that \nwas considered a functioning democracy until military leaders overthrew the \ndemocratically-elected government in September 2006 and declared martial law. Before \nthe military coup, Thailand enjoyed good relations and military alliances with the U.S. \nand cooperated with the U.S. on a wide variety of diplomatic and foreign policy issues. \nAfter the coup, the U.S. suspended funding for several military assistance programs, \nmilitary education programs, and joint counterterrorism programs. Funding was restored \nwhen a democratically-elected government took office in February 2008. Although the \ngovernment generally respects the human rights of its citizens, there have been \nproblems with security forces, which have used excessive force and sometimes have \nbeen connected to extrajudicial, arbitrary, and unlawful killings. The administrative \nnotice documents do not reflect any Thai intelligence activity directed at the U.S., but \nthe country continues to experience political instability, and there has been an increased \nrisk of terrorism, particularly in the southern regions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Thailand residing in the U.S. \n(\u00b6 1.a); she was serving as an officer in the Royal Thai Air Force when they were \nmarried (\u00b6 1.b); his spouse\u2019s brother-in-law is employed at the Thai Ministry of Interior (\u00b6 \n1.c); his spouse\u2019s former husband is an officer in the Royal Thai Air Force (\u00b6 1.d); his \nspouse\u2019s mother and son are citizens and residents of Thailand (\u00b6 1.e); and he traveled \n\n \n8 \n \n \nto Thailand in \u201cat least\u201d 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 (\u00b6 1.f). The security concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. First, a \ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Third, a security \nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \n \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. \n01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has \nrebutted this presumption.  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) \n(reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not consider \nterrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard, denoting a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The requirement for a \u201cheightened risk\u201d in \nthis case is established by the political instability in Thailand, the connections between \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and the Royal Thai Air Force, and the presence of his spouse\u2019s \nmother and son in Thailand.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse only recently retired from a career in the Royal Thai Air Force, \nand she receives retirement pay from the Thai government. Although Applicant testified \nhis spouse intends to become a U.S. citizen, she did not testify, leaving the extent and \ndepth of her loyalties to the government of Thailand and her former military colleagues \nunclear. Her connections to Thailand and the political instability in that country raise the \npotential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s travel to Thailand was either for official business or to visit his \nfuture wife. As such, it has no independent security significance. See ISCR Case No. \n02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Without evidence from Applicant\u2019s spouse, the depth and breadth \nof her loyalties to Thailand and her former military colleagues is difficult to assess. His \nspouse\u2019s mother and son reside in the Bangkok area and not in the southern regions \nwhere the threat of terrorism is greatest. Thailand has been a traditional ally of the U.S., \nbut has recently experienced political instability. Applicant has not shown that it is \n\n \n10 \n \n \nunlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his \nwife and her family and the interests of the U.S. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant\u2019s attachment to his wife is not \u201cminimal,\u201d but he has spent all his adult life in \nthe service of the U.S., most of it in the intelligence community. He served as a career \nofficer in the U.S. Navy, retiring as a commander. He has no financial interests in \nThailand and no intention to live there. He believes his wife will become a U.S. citizen \nand they will live out their lives in the U.S. While the evidence indicates Applicant would \nbe likely to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. if he realized there was a \nconflict, the evidence also suggests he has a \u201cblind spot,\u201d raising doubt whether he \nwould recognize that a conflict of interest existed if it involved his spouse. I conclude AG \n\u00b6 8(b) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThis mitigating condition is established because Applicant has virtually no contact with \nhis wife\u2019s mother, son, and siblings. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant married a foreign military officer while employed by a \ngovernment contractor and holding a security clearance without obtaining a foreign \nnational waiver (\u00b6 2.a). It also alleges Applicant\u2019s SCI eligibility was revoked in October \n2006 and the revocation was sustained on appeal (\u00b6 2.b). The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15, in pertinent part as follows: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d The SOR does not allege any security concerns \nunder Guideline K (Handling Protected Information).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b does not allege conduct by Applicant but merely describes the \ndecision of another agency. It does not describe conduct covered by any of the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 7. The basis for that agency\u2019s decision is the same \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.b. For all these reasons, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.b in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n \nThe applicable directive at the time of Applicant\u2019s marriage was Director of \nCentral Intelligence Directive (DCID) 6/4. That directive required that an individual \nseeking access to SCI be a U.S. citizen and that the individual\u2019s immediate family also \n\n \n11 \n \n \nbe U.S. citizens (DCID 6/4 \u00b6\u00b6 5a and b). Exceptions to the requirement that immediate \nfamily members be U.S. citizens were required to be approved by a Senior Official of \nthe Intelligence Community (SOIC), defined as the head of an organization or activity \nwithin the Intelligence Community (DCID 6/4 \u00b6 6.b). Exceptions to the citizenship \nrequirement required a \u201ccertification of compelling need\u201d (DCID 6/4 \u00b6 6.c). The term \n\u201cforeign national waiver\u201d did not appear in DCID 6/4, although it provided for approval of \nan exception to the requirement of U.S. citizenship. Department Counsel produced no \nevidence of any other directives, regulations, or policies providing for a \u201cforeign national \nwaiver.\u201d The first reference to a \u201cwaiver\u201d was in Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) \n704, which was not promulgated and effective until October 1, 2008.  \nThe Personnel Security Policy Advisory signed by Applicant in August 2003 \nadvised him that \u201cclose and continuing\u201d relationships with foreign nationals \u201care not \ncompatible with the security of [the agency\u2019s] sensitive mission.\u201d It also advised him to \n\u201cseek guidance from a security officer\u201d if he found himself involved in such a \nrelationship. Similar advice was contained in DCID 6/4 \u00b6 9, requiring individuals with \nSCI access \u201cto report to their cognizant security officer, in writing and when feasible in \nadvance, activities, conduct, or employment that could conflict with their ability to protect \nclassified information from unauthorized disclosure or counterintelligence threats.\u201d  \nThe evidence reflects that Applicant reported his relationship as it developed, \nand he reported his trips to Thailand and his intention to marry an officer in the Royal \nThai Air Force. He drafted a statement of compelling need for the signature of his \nsuperior, but he did not wait for an exception to be approved. Instead, he was married a \nfew days after the statement of compelling need was signed. Although he testified he \nwas unaware of the requirement for approval (or waiver) before his marriage, he knew, \nbased on his employer\u2019s Personnel Security Policy Advisory, that his relationship was \n\u201cnot compatible\u201d with his agency\u2019s mission. \nThree potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline E are relevant. AG \u00b6 \n16(c) applies when there is:  \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies when there is:  \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, \nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \n\n \n12 \n \n \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(f) applies when there is \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by \nthe individual to the employer as a condition of employment.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s professed ignorance of the provisions of DCID 6/4 in spite of his long \nhistory of working within the intelligence community is troubling. His relationship with a \nforeign military officer began shortly after his divorce and about a year after his careless \nsecurity breach in March 2003. He knew his relationship with a foreign military officer \nraised security concerns, and he dutifully reported the progress of his relationship to his \nsecurity officers. He appears to have been waiting for someone to wave a red flag and \ntell him to stop, but no one did. He either believed, based on his earlier experience with \nmarriage to a citizen of the United Kingdom, that his supervisor\u2019s signature on the \ncompelling need statement was tantamount to granting an exception to DCID 6/4, or he \nbelieved that his marriage without formal approval was a minor violation of the rules that \ncould be dealt with later. If he was ignorant of the requirement for SOIC approval of his \nmarriage, it was due to culpable negligence. A cursory review of DCID 6/4 would have \nmade it clear that more than a compelling need statement was required.  \nOn the other hand, the evidence reflects that Applicant complied with the \nguidance in the Personnel Security Policy Advisory by informing his security officer \nwhen his casual acquaintance blossomed into a friendship, progressed to a romantic \nrelationship, and finally led to marriage. He reported his trips to Thailand and his \nintention to marry. He reported his marriage shortly after it occurred, but he did not wait \nfor approval of an exception to the familial U.S. citizenship requirement.  \nWhether Applicant was culpably negligence or chose to marry without formal \napproval, there is sufficient evidence of bad judgment and inattention to security \nrequirements to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d). AG \u00b6 16(d) is raised because it was his \nsecond security violation within a relatively short time period, sufficient to constitute a \n\u201cpattern\u201d of rules violations. AG \u00b6 16(f) is not raised because Applicant heeded the \nadmonition in the Personnel Security Policy Advisory to seek guidance from a security \nofficer. There are no other documents in the record that substantiate a \u201cwritten or \nrecorded commitment.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s security violation in March 2003 was not alleged in the SOR. Conduct \nnot alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide \nwhether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole person analysis@ ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered \nthe March 2003 incident for these limited purposes. \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct can be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). \nApplicant\u2019s dereliction was not \u201cminor,\u201d because it raised sufficiently serious security \nconcerns to make him ineligible for SCI access. His marriage was relatively recent, and \nit was his second security-related incident in a three-year period. His involvement with a \nforeign military officer did not occur under unique circumstances. Notwithstanding \nApplicant\u2019s long service in the intelligence community and the testimonials submitted on \nhis behalf, his conduct raises doubt about his trustworthiness and good judgment. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior\u201d and has taken \u201cpositive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has \nacknowledged his behavior, and he is no longer undergoing the personal and \nprofessional stressors that existed between March 2003 and January 2006. He and his \nnew wife apparently have settled into life in the U.S. What is uncertain, however, is \nwhether he will again allow his personal desires to cloud his judgment when they are \nimpeded by security requirements. Accordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult with a long record of government \nservice. He held a clearance and SCI eligibility for many years. His application is \nsupported by several senior civilian and military officials who provided testimonials to \nhis good judgment and trustworthiness. Although his marriage makes him ineligible for \nSCI eligibility unless a waiver is granted in accordance with ICD 704, it does not \ndisqualify him from holding a clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant explained his March 2003 security violation by attributing it to job-\nrelated stress. His hasty marriage without formal SOIC approval was motivated by his \ndesire to begin his life together with his new wife, coupled with his professed ignorance \nof the applicable directive. The period from around March 2003 until January 2006 was \nan unsettled time in Applicant\u2019s life. His reaction to the stress factors in his life during \nthat period raises doubt about his current trustworthiness and good judgment, and the \nevidence he presented at the hearing has not dispelled that doubt. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and his \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 15, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On September 24, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether he was denied the due process\nafforded by the Directive.  For reasons set forth below, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had financial problems that began with medical expenses\noccasioned by his daughter\u2019s serious illness.  The Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s reply to the\nfile of relevant material (FORM) asserted that he had paid eight of the nine alleged debts and was\nresolving the remaining one.  She went on to observe, however, that Applicant had  \u201cfailed to submit\nany documents which show his debt payments and compliance with his payment plan.\u201d  Due to the\nabsence of corroborating evidence, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns in his case.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he possessed such corroborating evidence.  He\nstates that the two credit reports in the case file were outdated, because subsequent to their\npreparation he \u201chad taken several steps towards adjudicating those debts and had done so by the time\nthis case was submitted to the Administrative Judge.\u201d (emphasis added) Applicant went on to state\nthat he understood from Department Counsel that he did not need to submit the corroborating\nevidence.  \nI called [DOHA] and asked [Department Counsel] what information I needed to send\nin to the Judge as my defense.  I was told that a letter stating why I did not agree with\nthe investigation was sufficient material and I did not have to directly respond to each\nclaim independently.  Therefore, with that guidance, I submitted a letter of\nexplanation to the circumstances which led to my situation and statement of Personal\nFinances.  However, additional evidence is available to show that those debts have\nbeen settled as of the date indicated at the time of the hearing.  Applicant Brief at 1.\n  \nIn his reply brief, Department Counsel stated that DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the\nFORM, informing him of his right to submit material in mitigation.  However, Department Counsel\ndid not address Applicant\u2019s claim about the advice he purportedly gave as to the content of\nApplicant\u2019s reply to the FORM.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal submission contains matters outside the record, and the Appeal Board\nmay not consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29; ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  However, the Board has\ndistinguished between new evidence as to the allegations in an SOR, which is outside our scope of\n\nThe FORM states that \u201cApplicant will be given the opportunity to submit documentary information in rebuttal\n1\nor to explain adverse information in the FORM.\u201d (emphasis added)  It does not define \u201cinformation\u201d to include\n\u201cevidence,\u201d \u201ccorroboration,\u201d etc.\n3\nreview, and statements in an appeal which raise threshold issues of due process or jurisdiction.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-02994 at (App. Bd. May 12, 2005), which held that \u201cthe Directive does not\nprohibit the Board from considering, in an appropriate case, non-record statements for the limited\npurpose of deciding whether a party was wrongfully denied the opportunity to have evidence entered\ninto the record for the Administrative Judge to consider in a case.\u201d  See also ISCR Case No. 06-\n19169 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2007), in which the Board considered extra-record statements in an\nappeal brief in order to address a dispute over DOHA jurisdiction.  \nIn the case presently under review, Applicant has made a claim that he relied upon advice\nfrom Department Counsel in preparing his reply to the FORM.  Applicant contends that, in reliance\nupon this advice, he did not send to the Judge evidence in his possession at the time which would\nhave corroborated his claims to have paid his debts.   Department Counsel\u2019s brief does not explicitly\n1\naddress this contention, either to refute it in toto or otherwise explain it.  Consistent with the two\nprior cases cited above, the Board construes Applicant\u2019s appeal not as raising new evidence\nregarding his Guideline F security concerns but, rather, as having made a claim that his right to\nsubmit matters to the Judge in mitigation was impaired.  The parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, viewed\nin their entirety, present a question of whether Applicant was denied due process, and, because the\nJudge explicitly stated that she was influenced by the paucity of corroborating evidence, the\nconcomitant issue of harmful error, neither of which the Board is in a position to resolve, given the\ncurrent state of the record.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915\n(App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002) for discussion of\nharmful error.  \nThe Board does not have the authority to make factual findings.  Nor can we determine from\nthe record before us that Applicant\u2019s question is without consequence.  Compare, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-22217 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2008) (\u201cThe record as it now stands is inconsistent with\nApplicant\u2019s contention on appeal that she detrimentally relied on poor advice from Department\nCounsel in presenting her case\u201d).  See ISCR Case No. 05-03941 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007); ISCR\nCase No. 08-00613 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2009).  In similar situations, the Board has remanded\nthe case to the Judge to address the matter raised on appeal.  See ISCR Case No. 04-07825 (App. Bd.\nMar. 18, 2006) (Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM not included in the record); ISCR Case No. 06-\n19169, supra (Jurisdictional defect); ISCR Case No. 01-20562 (App. Bd.

He submitted a response and additional\nevidence on September 1, 2009. DOHA assigned this case to me on September 21,\n2009. The government submitted eight exhibits, which have been marked as Items 1-8\nand admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and\nadmitted as Item 2. His response and attachments to the FORM are admitted into\nevidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.i of the SOR, with explanations.

Based on this information, they requested the Bankruptcy court to\ndismiss their petition.  \n3\nIn April 2009, Applicant\u2019s employer reduced his weekly work hours from 40 hours\nto 32 hours, resulting in a 20 percent reduction in his income. Applicant\u2019s current net\nmonthly income from his work is $2,512. He also receives $857 a month in Veteran\u2019s\nAdministration (VA) compensation for a total net monthly income of $3,369. Applicant\u2019s\nmonthly expenses total $3,094, and include $900 for child support, cell phone, two car\npayments, car insurance, and other expenses. He included in his budget a $250\npayment to the creditor in allegation 1.b, and two $50 payments for two debts not\nalleged in the SOR. After paying his expenses, Applicant has a remainder of $275 each\nmonth. He rents the house he owns. His rental income pays the mortgage on the house.\nHe lives with his parents.  \n4\nApplicant and his former wife purchased a travel trailer in 2005 for $18,000. They\npaid their monthly payments on the travel trailer, but they were late once just before\ntheir bankruptcy filing. The creditor eventually charged off the debt. Applicant entered\ninto a stipulated judgment with the creditor\u2019s attorneys in February 2009, which was filed\nin and endorsed by  the court on February 11, 2009. Under the terms of the agreement,\nApplicant pays $250 a month until the debt is paid in full. Although Applicant included\nthis payment in his budget, he did not provide documentary proof that he is in\ncompliance with the terms of the stipulated judgment.5\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he resolved the remaining\neight debts listed in the SOR. When he met with the security clearance investigator on\nOctober 30, 2008, he showed the investigator a bank statement regarding payments to\nthe creditor listed in SOR allegation 1.g. The investigator verified that Applicant paid a\nsettlement for this debt on September 29, 2008. The debt is no longer on his credit\nreport. Applicant verified that he paid another debt, but the evidence of record does not\nindicate that the $3,000 debt he paid is the same as the debt listed in SOR allegation\n1.e. Applicant did not provide documentary proof to support his statement that he\nresolved the remaining seven SOR debts.6\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\nHis delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR\n7\nCase No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. BD. Aug. 29, 2008)(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. BD. Oct. 16, 2002)).\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ While\nApplicant=s financial worries arose subsequent to his daughter\u2019s diabetes diagnosis in\n2004 and the resulting medical bills, his debt did not arise from circumstances that are\nunlikely to recur.   Thus, this mitigating condition does not apply. \n7\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started with his daughter\u2019s health problems. His divorce\nincreased his financial burdens. Circumstances beyond his control contributed to his\nfinancial problems. Had he provided the documentary evidence showing his debt\npayments, I would find he acted responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I\nfind this mitigating condition only partially applicable in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant indicated that he contacted several\ncredit counseling companies, but failed to provide documentary evidence that he did so.\nThere is no evidence in the record that his debts are being resolved. This mitigating\ncondition is not applicable. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\nresolved one debt, but has not provided proof that he resolved the remaining debts and\n\n6\nis in compliance with his one payment plan. This mitigating condition applies to the debt\nin allegation 1.g.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems first began when his young daughter was diagnosed with diabetes\nand required expensive and long-term treatment. He accumulated significant debt trying\nto pay for her medical care, which is a circumstance largely beyond his control. His\nrecent divorce also impacted his finances. Although Applicant indicated that he paid\neight of the nine debts listed in the SOR and is resolving the remaining debt through a\npayment plan, he failed to submitted any documents which show his debt payments and\ncompliance with his payment plan. Thus, he has not provided evidence which indicated\nthat he mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns about his finances.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsideraitons.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The letter does not clarify what type of additional information can be submitted in a financial case. Rather, it is a generic letter which covers the variety of cases which must be decided under the adjudicative guidelines. In this case, after reviewing the letter and FORM, Applicant called Department Counsel for further information on how to respond, because he did not understand what he could include in his response. Department Counsel does not specifically recall his conversation with Applicant or the information provided. Department Counsel\u2019s usual habit is to advise an applicant that he can provide any information that he wishes the Administrative Judge to consider and that he could supplement his answer to the SOR. After his conversation with Department Counsel, Applicant understood that he could respond to the allegations in the FORM with a letter, explaining what he had done to resolve his debt problems.

The parties and I held a telephone conference on January 22, 2010,\nwhere the parties requested to submit declarative statements, rather than hold a\nhearing. On the same date, I issued a second Order, directing the parties to submit their\ndeclarative statements no later than February 4, 2010. The parties complied with my\nOrder.  \n\n3\nAfter reviewing the declarations of the parties and the June 29, 2009 cover letter\nto Applicant, I made the following findings of fact in my February 17, 2010 order: \nThe cover letter advises an applicant in a FORM case that he can\nobject to information in the FORM and submit any additional information\nhe wishes to be considered. The letter does not clarify what type of\nadditional information can be submitted in a financial case. Rather, it is a\ngeneric letter which covers the variety of cases which must be decided\nunder the adjudicative guidelines. In this case, after reviewing the letter\nand FORM, Applicant called Department Counsel for further information\non how to respond, because he did not understand what he could include\nin his response.\nDepartment Counsel does not specifically recall his conversation\nwith Applicant or the information provided. Department Counsel\u2019s usual\nhabit is to advise an applicant that he can provide any information that he\nwishes the Administrative Judge to consider and that he could supplement\nhis answer to the SOR. \nAfter his conversation with Department Counsel, Applicant\nunderstood that he could respond to the allegations in the FORM with a\nletter, explaining what he had done to resolve his debt problems. He also\nunderstood that he did not need to submit any additional materials\nbecause his letter would address the debt allegations.\nI concluded that in this particular case, Applicant clearly misunderstood the\nmeaning \nand \ncontent \nof \nhis \nconversation \nwith \nDepartment \nCounsel. \nHis\nmisunderstanding should not be prejudicial to a fair decision. I held the record open for\n30 days for Applicant to submit all written documentation verifying his debt resolution,\nwhich he intended to submit with his response of September 1, 2009, and stated that\ndocumentation dated after September 1, 2009 will not be admitted into the record. I\ngave Department Counsel 30 days after the receipt of Applicant\u2019s documentation to\nsubmit a response.\nApplicant timely submitted documentation to support his argument that he had\nmitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns. Department Counsel responded on\nMarch 31, 2010, objecting to the redaction of information in the bank statement\ndocuments submitted by Applicant, as part of his proof of payment, and Applicant\nAttachments 1 and 4. By e-mail dated April 6, 2010, I gave Applicant until April 20, 2010\nto respond to the Government\u2019s objection.\nOn April 9, 2010, Applicant requested an extension of time to respond to the\nGovernment\u2019s objection. By Order dated April 16, 2010 and for good cause shown, I\ngranted Applicant until April 30, 2010 to respond. Applicant forwarded an e-mail to me\non May 4, 2010, indicating additional problems with obtaining information to respond to\nthe Government\u2019s concerns. Because I considered the e-mail an ex-parte\n\nApplicant attachment 1 is marked AE A; Attachment 2 is marked AE B; Attachment 3 is marked AE C;\n4\nAttachment 4 is marked AE D; Attachment 5 is marked AE E; Attachment 6 is marked AE F; Attachment 7 is\nmarked AE G; and Applicant\u2019s June 9, 2010 fax transmittal is marked AE H.  AE C showed a debt payment\non September 10, 2009, 10 days after Applicant submitted his answer. Although outside of the time limit set\nin my February 17, 2010 Order, this evidence is admitted as the Government is not prejudiced by its\nadmission.\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n5\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nItem 3.\n6\n4\ncommunication, I conducted a telephone conference call with the parties on May 6,\n2010.  Based on this call, I gave Applicant until May 24, 2010 to submit the additional\ninformation. Applicant continued to experience problems with obtaining his information\nbecause he travels in his job. \nApplicant submitted his last documentation on June 9, 2010. The record closed\nas of this date. The documentary evidence submitted by Applicant has been marked as\nAE A through AE H and admitted into evidence.  The Government\u2019s objection to\n4\nApplicant\u2019s redaction of his bank statements is overruled. Likewise, the Government\u2019s\nobjection to Attachments 1 and 4 are overruled and these documents will be accorded\nappropriate weight, if any.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.i of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the security concern under\nGuideline F, arguing his finances should not be a security concern.  He also provided\n5\nadditional explanations, but not documentary evidence to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 38 years old, works as a project manager for a Department of\nDefense contractor. Applicant started his employment with this company in 1998.\nApplicant and his wife married in 1992 and divorced in 2008. He has a son, age 15, and\na daughter, age 11.6\nIn January 2004, doctors diagnosed his young daughter with diabetes. She\nrequired extensive and expensive medical treatment for a long period of time. Because\ninsurance did not cover all of her medical costs, Applicant used credit cards to pay for\nher treatment. Over time, his expenses became overwhelming. In early 2007, Applicant\ncontacted several credit management agencies to consolidate his debts. Upon the\nrecommendation of these credit counseling companies, he allowed his debts to become\n60 days delinquent. One company established a suggested repayment plan, which he\n\nItem 5, at 5-6; Response to FORM.\n7\nResponse to FORM; Item 6; Item 7; Item 8.\n8\n5\ncould not afford. He and his former wife then decided to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy,\nwhich they did in September 2007 without the assistance of counsel. They met once\nwith the bankruptcy trustee and learned that their debt-to-income ratio was not sufficient\nfor filing bankruptcy. Based on this information, they requested the Bankruptcy court to\ndismiss their petition.  \n7\nIn April 2009, Applicant\u2019s employer reduced his weekly work hours from 40 hours\nto 32 hours, resulting in a 20 percent reduction in his income. Applicant\u2019s current net\nmonthly income from his work is $2,512. He also receives $857 a month in Veteran\u2019s\nAdministration (VA) compensation for a total net monthly income of $3,369. Applicant\u2019s\nmonthly expenses total $3,094, and include $900 for child support, cell phone, two car\npayments, car insurance, and other expenses. He included in his budget a $250\npayment to the creditor in allegation 1.b, and two $50 payments for two debts not\nalleged in the SOR. After paying his expenses, Applicant has a remainder of $275 each\nmonth. He rents out the house he owns. His rental income pays the mortgage on the\nhouse. He lives with his parents. The two credit reports of record reflect that Applicant\npaid or pays many of his bills in a timely fashion.  \n8\nApplicant and his former wife purchased a travel trailer in 2005 for $18,000. They\npaid their monthly payments on the travel trailer, but they were late once just before\ntheir bankruptcy filing. The creditor eventually charged off the debt. Applicant entered\ninto a stipulated judgment with the creditor\u2019s attorneys in February 2009, which was filed\nin and endorsed by the court on February 11, 2009 and is part of the record. Under the\nterms of the agreement, Applicant promised to pay $250 a month until the debt is paid\nin full. Applicant included this payment in his budget; however, he did not provide\ndocumentary proof that he is in compliance with the terms of the stipulated judgment.\nHe should have provided evidence of eight payments from February 2009 to September\n2009. He recently requested verification of his payments from the creditor, but has not\nreceived a response to his request. He did not provide copies of his cancelled checks,\nbank statements or an authorization for the creditor to automatically withdraw the\npayments from his checking account, documents which would show he made his\nmonthly payments.\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he resolved the remaining\nseven debts listed in the SOR. When he met with the security clearance investigator on\nOctober 30, 2008, he showed the investigator a bank statement regarding payments to\nthe creditor listed in SOR allegation 1.g. The investigator verified that Applicant paid a\nsettlement for this debt on September 29, 2008. He also provided a copy of his\ncancelled check to the collection agency for this creditor and the bank statement\n\nItem 5; AE E.\n9\nItem 5, Item 6; Item 7; Item 8; AE D.\n10\nAE F.\n11\nAE B.\n12\nItem 8; AE C.\n13\nItem 7; Item 8; AE A.\n14\n6\nshowing a withdrawal in this amount on the above date. The debt is no longer on his\ncredit report. This debt is paid.9\n When Applicant and his former wife filed for bankruptcy in 2007, they listed two\ncredit card debts. They owed approximately $4,500 on a credit card to bank one.\nAppellant paid a settlement on this debt on September 30, 2008 and has verified\npayment of this debt, which was not listed on the December 15, 2008 credit report.\nApplicant and his former wife also owed $2,047 on a VISA credit card with bank two, the\ndebt listed in SOR allegation 1.e. This debt is listed in the April 8, 2008 and December\n15, 2008 credit reports as a charge off. In his May 21, 2008 interview with the security\ninvestigator, Applicant acknowledged this debt as unpaid and separate from the bank\none debt. In his answers to interrogatories, he indicated that he had telephoned the\ncollection agent for bank two several times, but had not received a response. He  has\nnot provided documentary proof that this debt is paid or in a payment plan.10\nThe remaining debts listed in the SOR are discussed as follows:\n1.c\nThe bank charged off an unpaid credit card debt in the\namount of $4,064. Applicant paid this debt in April 2009.11\n1.d\nThe bank charged off this unpaid account in the amount of\n$2,504. Applicant paid this debt in August 2009.12\n1.f\nThe April 8, 2008 credit report lists a medical bill for $115.\nApplicant provided proof that he paid this bill to the collection\nagent for the medical provider. The account number on the\npaid account is the same as the account number listed in the\ncredit report.  \n13\n1.h\nTwo medical bills for $78 and $73 respectively are listed in\nthe SOR, but not on the credit reports. Applicant provided\nproof that he does not owe this provider any money.14\n\n7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n8\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt and was unable to pay some\nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ While\nApplicant=s financial worries arose subsequent to his daughter\u2019s diabetes diagnosis in\n2004 and the resulting medical bills, his debt problems raise concerns about his current\nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Thus, this mitigating condition does not\napply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started with his daughter\u2019s health problems. His divorce\nincreased his financial burdens. Circumstances beyond his control contributed to his\nfinancial problems. Applicant contacted refinance companies and credit management\ncompanies for help with his debts before he defaulted on them. These companies failed\nto provide the necessary help, so he and his former wife filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy. They decided not proceed after meeting with the bankruptcy trustee. Since\nthen, Applicant has paid six of the eight debts listed in the SOR and agreed to repay his\nlargest SOR debt. He acted responsibly by seeking help to gain control over his\nfinances. I find this mitigating condition applicable. \n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n15\n9\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant indicated that he contacted several\ncredit counseling companies, but failed to provide documentary evidence that he did so.\nLikewise, the record does not contain evidence that he received debt counseling. He\nhas resolved six of the debts listed in the SOR, plus one other debt not listed in the\nSOR, but which occurred in the same time period. This mitigating condition is partially\napplicable. \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant\ncontacted several of his creditors and paid several of his debts before the SOR was\nissued. He agreed to the entry of a stipulated judgment on his largest debt which the\ncourt entered as a judgment in February 2009. He has not provided documentation\nwhich showed that he has complied with the terms of this agreement. He also paid\nseveral other debts listed in the SOR This mitigating condition applies to the debts in\nallegations 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f-1.i.15\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or deny a\nsecurity clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \n\n10\nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems first began when his young daughter was diagnosed with diabetes\nand required expensive and long-term medical treatment. He accumulated significant\ndebt trying to pay for her medical care, which is a circumstance largely beyond his\ncontrol. His recent divorce also adversely impacted his finances. Through his evidence,\nApplicant showed that he did not ignore his debts and that he acted to resolve his\nsmaller debts. He also took action on his larger debt by contacting counsel for the\ncreditor and entering into an agreement which required him to repay his debt on a\nmonthly basis. Through his evidence, he provided proof that he paid six of the eight\ndebts listed in the SOR. He has not shown that he paid the debt listed in SOR allegation\n1.e nor has he provided proof that he has complied with his agreement to pay his\nlargest debt, the debt in SOR allegation 1.b for $15,246. In weighing the positive\nevidence on the actions he has taken against the lack of evidence that Applicant is\npaying the largest debt listed in the SOR, I find that the lack of proof regarding\npayments of $250 a month from February 2009 to September 2009 on his largest debt\nweighs heavily against Applicant. Thus, he has not provided sufficient evidence to\nmitigate the government\u2019s security concerns about his finances.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 15, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On September 24, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether he was denied the due process\nafforded by the Directive.  For reasons set forth below, we remand the case to the Judge.\n\n2\nThe Judge found that Applicant had financial problems that began with medical expenses\noccasioned by his daughter\u2019s serious illness.  The Judge acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s reply to the\nfile of relevant material (FORM) asserted that he had paid eight of the nine alleged debts and was\nresolving the remaining one.  She went on to observe, however, that Applicant had  \u201cfailed to submit\nany documents which show his debt payments and compliance with his payment plan.\u201d  Due to the\nabsence of corroborating evidence, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns in his case.\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he possessed such corroborating evidence.  He\nstates that the two credit reports in the case file were outdated, because subsequent to their\npreparation he \u201chad taken several steps towards adjudicating those debts and had done so by the time\nthis case was submitted to the Administrative Judge.\u201d (emphasis added) Applicant went on to state\nthat he understood from Department Counsel that he did not need to submit the corroborating\nevidence.  \nI called [DOHA] and asked [Department Counsel] what information I needed to send\nin to the Judge as my defense.  I was told that a letter stating why I did not agree with\nthe investigation was sufficient material and I did not have to directly respond to each\nclaim independently.  Therefore, with that guidance, I submitted a letter of\nexplanation to the circumstances which led to my situation and statement of Personal\nFinances.  However, additional evidence is available to show that those debts have\nbeen settled as of the date indicated at the time of the hearing.  Applicant Brief at 1.\n  \nIn his reply brief, Department Counsel stated that DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the\nFORM, informing him of his right to submit material in mitigation.  However, Department Counsel\ndid not address Applicant\u2019s claim about the advice he purportedly gave as to the content of\nApplicant\u2019s reply to the FORM.  \nApplicant\u2019s appeal submission contains matters outside the record, and the Appeal Board\nmay not consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29; ISCR Case No. 08-06875 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 08-06518 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 3, 2009).  However, the Board has\ndistinguished between new evidence as to the allegations in an SOR, which is outside our scope of\nreview, and statements in an appeal which raise threshold issues of due process or jurisdiction.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-02994 at (App. Bd. May 12, 2005), which held that \u201cthe Directive does not\nprohibit the Board from considering, in an appropriate case, non-record statements for the limited\npurpose of deciding whether a party was wrongfully denied the opportunity to have evidence entered\ninto the record for the Administrative Judge to consider in a case.\u201d  See also ISCR Case No. 06-\n19169 at 2 (App. Bd.

Department Counsel\u2019s brief does not explicitly\n1\naddress this contention, either to refute it in toto or otherwise explain it.  Consistent with the two\nprior cases cited above, the Board construes Applicant\u2019s appeal not as raising new evidence\nregarding his Guideline F security concerns but, rather, as having made a claim that his right to\nsubmit matters to the Judge in mitigation was impaired.  The parties\u2019 submissions on appeal, viewed\nin their entirety, present a question of whether Applicant was denied due process, and, because the\nJudge explicitly stated that she was influenced by the paucity of corroborating evidence, the\nconcomitant issue of harmful error, neither of which the Board is in a position to resolve, given the\ncurrent state of the record.  See ISCR 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915\n(App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002) for discussion of\nharmful error.  \nThe Board does not have the authority to make factual findings.  Nor can we determine from\nthe record before us that Applicant\u2019s question is without consequence.  Compare, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-22217 at 3 (App. Bd.

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant smoked marijuana with varying frequency from about 1997 to 2008. He\ndeliberately did not disclose on his March 2008 security clearance application that he\nhad smoked marijuana after July 2007. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 24, 2008. On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\ndecision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \nAugust 5, 2009\n\nThe e-QIP consists of an investigation request cover sheet and the QNSP (pages 2-36) (Ex. 1).\n1\nAt his hearing, Applicant denied that he had used any marijuana while employed by the jeweler (Tr.\n2\n25), but he had indicated on his e-QIP that he used marijuana 15 times within the listed dates of September\n2000 to July 2007.\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on March 12, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 29, 2009, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him. On May 4, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for May 28, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The government submitted two exhibits\n(Ex. 1-2), which were entered into evidence without any objections. Department\nCounsel called Applicant to testify in its case and Applicant\u2019s spouse in rebuttal.\nApplicant submitted two exhibits (Ex. A-B), which were entered without any objections,\nand he, his spouse, and a friend testified on his behalf.  A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing\nwas received on June 8, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline H (drug involvement) that Applicant used\nmarijuana with varying frequency from about September 2000 to at least January 2008\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant was alleged under Guideline E (personal conduct) to have\nfalsified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions on March 24, 2008,  by not\n1\ndisclosing that he had used marijuana use after July 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant\nindicated in his Answer that he had last used marijuana in January 2008. He averred\nhe was confused (dates mixed up) when he was interviewed and when he completed\nhis security clearance application, but he also stated, \u201cI do apologize for the falsified\ninformation.\u201d After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old \u201cinstall mechanic\u201d (outside electrician), who has been\nemployed by a defense contractor since March 17, 2008 (Exs. 1, A, Tr. 20). He seeks\nhis first security clearance (Tr. 58). He had previously worked for a jeweler in its call\ncenter until January 2003 (Ex. 1, Tr. 19). From March 2003 to November 2003, he\nworked for a supermarket (Ex. 1. Tr. 80). From December 2003 to October 2007, he\nwas employed caring for residents in a state facility for the mentally disabled (Ex. 1, Tr.\n25, 81). Applicant attended a local technical institute from July 2006 to September 2007\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 19). He successfully completed a program of study to become an electronic\nsystems technician (Tr. 71) before starting his defense contractor employment.\nApplicant used marijuana as a high school student, as frequently as once weekly\nto twice monthly during his sophomore year in 1997, but only five times during his\nsenior year (Tr. 24). He smoked marijuana at least once in September 2000 while\nworking for the jeweler after he graduated from high school (Ex. 1).  He enjoyed the\n2\ndrug (Ex. 2) and continued to smoke it \u201cin a bowl\u201d with friends. He now claims to be\nunable to recall the dates that he used marijuana because he did not use it often\n\nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that she had been informed by Applicant that he smoked marijuana\n3\nshortly before he was hired by the defense contractor, that he stopped, but then he used it again before his\ninterview (Tr. 48-52).  Her testimony about him smoking marijuana in spring 2008 is credible. Applicant\u2019s\nadmission to the investigator in June 2008  that he intended to continue to use marijuana a few times each\nmonth strongly suggests that he was using marijuana as of spring 2008. Applicant\u2019s spouse testified in rebuttal\nthat Applicant also used marijuana around his birthday in December 2008 because he exhibited indicators of\nuse (bloodshot eyes, tired, \u201cout of it\u201d). She confronted him in anger at that time and did not believe him when\nhe denied he used the drug (Tr. 90-92). Applicant attributed his \u201creally red eyes\u201d to allergies (Tr. 64). W hile\nhis spouse maintained that she knew the difference between allergies and  \u201cbeing high\u201d (Tr. 92), she could\nnot confirm whether Applicant smelled of marijuana on that occasion as she was not familiar with the odor (Tr.\n93). The evidence is insufficient to prove that Applicant smoked marijuana in December 2008.\nApplicant and his spouse had their second child, a daughter, in late November 2008 (Tr. 21, 44).\n4\n3\nenough to give accurate dates (Tr. 27).  A friend, with whom he worked both at the\nsupermarket and at the state facility for the mentally disabled, testified that he smoked\nmarijuana with Applicant about once a month while they were coworkers at the\nsupermarket (Tr. 85-86). Applicant estimated at his hearing that he smoked marijuana\n\u201cmaybe about three or four times\u201d (Tr. 27) after his marriage in October 2005, with a last\nuse in January 2008. In summer 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse observed him smoke\nmarijuana at a party. She has not otherwise seen him smoke marijuana (Tr. 46),\nalthough Applicant shared with her in January 2008 that he had recently smoked\nmarijuana (Tr. 47). Applicant again smoked marijuana in spring 2008, sometime after he\nstarted working for the defense contractor in March 2008 but before June 2008 (Tr. 48).3\nHis use of marijuana in 2008 occurred after he became a father in May 2007 (Ex. 1, Tr.\n20, 26, 43),  and knowing that his spouse disapproved of his involvement with the drug\n4\n(Tr. 52, 55). Applicant obtained his marijuana from friends (Ex. 2).\nOn March 24, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance. He indicated on\nhis e-QIP that he had used marijuana 15 times within the September 2000 to July 2007\ntime frame (Ex. 1).  Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on June 3,\n2008, in part about his illegal drug involvement. Applicant informed the investigator that\nhe had smoked small quantities of marijuana with friends in their homes about 15 times\nfrom September 2000 to January 2008. He expressed plans to continue to use the drug\na few times each month because he enjoyed it, and he admitted that he associated\nabout once monthly with a few individuals who use marijuana. Applicant denied he was\nsusceptible to blackmail because his spouse and some friends knew of his marijuana\nuse (Ex. 2). \nAt DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant reviewed the investigator\u2019s report of his June 2008\ninterview. On September 29, 2008, Applicant confirmed that the report accurately\nreflected the information he had provided in June 2008, but he also indicated that his\nuse of marijuana would no longer continue. He had not realized that marijuana use\ncould cause him to lose his security clearance and his priority was to provide for his\nfamily. He denied any ongoing contact with the people from whom he had previously\nobtained marijuana (Ex. 2). \nAt his security clearance hearing in May 2009, Applicant denied he had used any\nmarijuana after going to work for the defense contractor in March 2008 (Tr. 23, 30, 59).\n\n4\nApplicant had been offered some marijuana in his own home by his neighbors in 2009,\n\u201ca couple of months ago,\u201d but he declined the offer (Tr. 62-63). There is no evidence to\nrebut Applicant\u2019s testimony that he denied his neighbor\u2019s offer of marijuana in early\n2009. Applicant\u2019s job is very important to him and to his young family, and he resolved\naround September 2008 to forego any future use of the drug (Tr. 33, 57).\nApplicant met his former employer\u2019s expectations when he worked with mentally\ndisabled residents (Ex. A). He has also been a productive employee for the defense\ncontractor (Ex. B). He was awarded a merit pay increase at the end of his first six\nmonths on the job.\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n5\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant began using marijuana in high school, up to weekly at times during his\nsophomore year. He claims to be unable to provide accurate dates of his marijuana use\nafter high school and to have no recollection of any use after January 2008, but there is\ncredible evidence of marijuana use monthly during part of the time that he worked at the\nsupermarket in 2003, and occasionally after he was married in October 2005, including\nin July 2007, January 2008, and spring 2008. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d applies.\nApplicant obtained marijuana from friends on occasion, so AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d applies. AG \u00b6 25(h), \u201cexpressed\nintent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to\ndiscontinue drug use,\u201d applied as of June 2008 when he admitted to a government\ninvestigator that he intended to continue to smoke marijuana because he enjoyed it.\nHowever, he reconsidered that decision when he realized that continued marijuana use\ncould cost him his defense contractor employment. Despite Applicant\u2019s suspect\ncredibility about his last use of marijuana (see Guideline E, infra), I accept his testimony\nthat he no longer intends to smoke marijuana in the future. \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is too recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is likely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Concerning AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201ca demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d Applicant indicated in his September 2008\nresponse to interrogatories that he no longer had contact with the persons who provided\nhim marijuana (AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts\u201d), and that his use of marijuana would not continue (AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\u201d). Applicant\u2019s\nspouse remains convinced that he used marijuana in December 2008 based on his\noutward appearance, but she was unable to confirm whether Applicant smelled of\nmarijuana, and he denied using it. Irrespective of whether he used marijuana in\nDecember 2008, AG \u00b6 26(b) would not fully mitigate the Guideline H concerns.\nApplicant admitted to his spouse that he smoked marijuana on one occasion after he\nstarted working for the defense contractor employer, and it can reasonably be inferred\nthat he was smoking marijuana in spring 2008 in light of his June 2008 admission that\nhe intended to continue to smoke marijuana a few times each month. A longer period of\nabstinence is warranted before I am able to conclude that his marijuana use is unlikely\nto recur. He clearly enjoyed the drug and smoked it despite his spouse\u2019s expressed\ndisapproval.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in March 2008, he disclosed that\nhe had used marijuana 15 times between September 2000 and July 2007. When he\nwas interviewed in June 2008, and at his hearing, he admitted that he had used\nmarijuana as recently as January 2008. In his Answer, he claimed he was confused (\u201cI\njust got my dates mixed up\u201d), but he also apologized \u201cfor the falsified information.\u201d It is\ndifficult to believe Applicant would have not recalled that he had used marijuana in\nJanuary 2008 when he applied for his security clearance in March 2008.  When asked\nat his hearing to explain the omission of his January 2008 use, Applicant testified he\nhad filled out his e-QIP in 2007. After his attention was directed to the March 2008\nsignature date on his e-QIP, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have an explanation for that.\u201d\n(Tr. 37). Moreover, his suspect denials of any marijuana involvement after he had\nbegun working for his employer undermine his claim of confusion with regard to his e-\nQIP omission. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\n\nThere is no indication that Applicant told the government investigator about his use of marijuana in\n5\nhigh school. He graduated in June 2000 (Ex. 1). However, not knowing whether Applicant was asked about\nany marijuana use before September 2000, I cannot conclude that Applicant concealed information from the\ninvestigator.\n7\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. \nApplicant acknowledged his use of marijuana between September 2000 and\nJanuary 2008 when he was interviewed by the government investigator in June 2008.5\nHe candidly admitted that he intended to continue to smoke marijuana because he\nenjoyed it. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification, before being confronted with the facts,\u201d cannot\napply in mitigation, however. It is unclear whether he volunteered the information before\nhe was questioned about his illegal drug involvement. Furthermore, his case in reform is\nundermined by his recent denials of any illegal drug use after January 2008. His spouse\ntestified credibly that he told her he had used marijuana after he had begun working for\nthe defense contractor, and he had admitted to the government investigator that he\nintended to continue to smoke marijuana because he enjoyed it. Under the\ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur,\u201d also does not apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant began using marijuana when he was in high school. Although he likely\nstarted using marijuana because of peer pressure, he came to enjoy it and continued to\nsmoke the drug until at least the spring of 2008 despite his spouse\u2019s disapproval. He\n\n8\nwas not completely forthcoming about his marijuana use on his security clearance\napplication. Applicant\u2019s decision to forego future drug use alleviates some of the\nsecurity concerns in this case, but considerable doubts persist about whether he has\nbeen fully candid with the government about his marijuana involvement. While I can\nappreciate Applicant\u2019s desire to retain his defense contractor employment, the\ngovernment must be assured that those persons granted access to classified\ninformation can be counted on to act without regard to personal interests. Given the\nrecency of his drug use and his evasive testimony about his marijuana involvement, I\nam unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant access to classified information, notwithstanding his good work record with\nthe defense contractor.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 10, 2008, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial \nproblems as evicenced by delinquent debts. \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApril 15, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\n  \n \nOn December 18, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn February 9, 2009, I was assigned the case.

Applicant\u2019s admissions to the \nSOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old plastic fabricator who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nAll of the debts in question listed in the SOR are for credit cards acquired in 1999 \nand 2000. (Tr. 26) In 1999, Applicant graduated from high school. Applicant worked two \njobs and attended college at night. (Tr. 25) At age 18 and 19, while in college, Applicant \nreceived a number of unsolicited credit cards, which he used. The credit cards had very \nhigh interest rates, some as high as 28%. (Tr. 25) By 2003, Applicant was no longer \nable to pay his credit card bills. (Ex. 3)  \n \n \nApplicant owed one credit card company (SOR \u00b6 1.a) $3,934. The debt has been \npaid and settled in full. (Ex. C, F) He owed $2,200 on a bank credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.b), \nwhich has been settled in full. (Ex. D) The $203 debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d relates to a \ncompany which is out of business. Applicant provided proof that he sent two checks to \nthe collection agency to pay this debt. 9Ex. F) \n \n \nApplicant had two credit cards with the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($5,712), \nwhich became delinquent in 2004. The accounts were transferred to another credit card \nand Applicant was contacted by a collection agency about this debt. (Ex. 3) Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 2008 credit bureau report (CBR) indicates the account was transferred or \nsold and the account charged off. (Ex. 4, p 2) Applicant\u2019s April 2008 CBR indicates one \nof the accounts was with a collection agency and the other account was \u201cpurchased by \nanother lender.\u201d (Ex. 5, p 15, 16)  \n \n \nThe debt for these two accounts was transferred to creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d \n($6,455). These debts have been settled in full. (Ex. A, F) The collection firm\u2019s February \n2009 letter indicates the balance was $6,455 (the amount listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e) and \nreferences an account number, which is listed in the April 2008 CBR as belonging to the \ncreditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c and SOR \u00b6 1.e are the same \ndebt.  \n \n\n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a job working in a daycare center. (Tr. 31) His first child was \nborn in September 2008. Due to the importance to himself and his family that he pay his \nobligations, Applicant sold his four wheeler, hunting gear, and guns to raise the funds \nnecessary to pay his past due obligations. (Tr. 28) Applicant provided proof of payment \nfor two additional debts not listed as debts of concern in the SOR. (Ex. C, E) Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly net income is $4,335. His monthly expenses are $2,212, which leaves his \nmonthly disposable income at $1,068. If granted a clearance, his salary would increase \nby $20,000 annually. (Tr. 30)  His financial obligations are being paid in a timely \nmanner.  He is not being contacted by creditors.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n\n \n \n \n4\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, SOR \nresponse, his response to interrogatories, and his testimony. Throughout this process, \nhe had admitted responsibility for his debts. At age 18 or 19 Applicant obtained credit \ncards and incurred debts. The five debts listed in the SOR totaled more than $18,000. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n  \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n \n \n5\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by his \nobtaining credit cards when he was 18 or 19 years old and lacked knowledge of \nproperly handling credit. His family circumstances have changed. He is married and \nrecently become a father. It is unlikely he will again incur financial problems due to \ncredit cards. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n \nAG & 20(b) does not apply because his financial problems were not beyond his \ncontrol. Although a 28% interest rate on the creditor cards greatly contributed to his \ninability to repay his debt. The interest rate was a factor beyond his control.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), Applicant has paid all of his debts. There is a \nclear indication that his financial problems are resolved. He entered into a good-faith \neffort and has repaid his debts. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) apply. AG & 20(e) does not \napply because Applicant did not dispute his debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n \n \n6\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts were incurred when \nApplicant was young and not financially savvy. He obtained the credit cards when he \nwas 18 or 19 years old. He is now 28. His inability to repay the debts was caused by the \nvery high interest rate the credit card companies charged. Understanding the \nseriousness of maintaining good credit and paying his past due obligations, Applicant \nchose to sell his hunting equipment and guns to pay his debts. So doing indicates \nApplicant understands how important it is to maintain good credit. His debts now having \nbeen paid, it is unlikely he will incur additional obligations that would become past due. \nIn September 2008, he became a father, which has greatly impacted on his view of life \nand properly maintaining his credit.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

It detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 9, 2009. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated October 19, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on December 14, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to Administrative Judge Thomas Crean on January 14, 2010. It was \nreassigned to me on March 4, 2010, due to Applicant\u2019s deployment to Haiti and \nanticipated unavailability until June 2011. He returned earlier than initially expected. A \nNotice of Hearing was issued on March 18, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as \nscheduled, on April 22, 2010. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, 8 Government exhibits and 13 Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on May 5, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of the Guideline F factual \nallegations (\u00b6 2.c.), denied the Guideline E factual allegation (\u00b6 1.a.), and two of the \nGuideline F factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as \na network engineer,3 and he is seeking to retain a security clearance. He had previously \nbeen granted a TOP SECRET security clearance.4 Applicant was born in Vietnam in \n1956,5 escaped by boat to the Philippines,6 resided in a refugee camp in the \nPhilippines,7 and in 1981, immigrated to the United States.8 He earned a Bachelor of \nScience degree in electrical engineering in June 1986.9 He became a naturalized U.S. \n \n3 Tr. at 59-60.  \n \n4 Id. at 21. Applicant contended he has held a security clearance of an unspecified level since 1990, and a \nTOP SECRET security clearance since March 1993.

During \nthe period 1994 through 1997, Applicant and his then live-in girlfriend frequented \ncasinos where they watched musical entertainment and gambled.18 While he gambled \nto a limited degree, playing slot machines and roulette, because he did not really enjoy \ngambling,19 his girlfriend did it as a hobby, playing blackjack and roulette, and had a \nserious problem with gambling.20 They were co-applicants on several credit cards and \ncredit lines, and, initially with his acquiescence, those cards and lines were generally \nused by her to fund her gambling activities.21 Transaction Reports by Casino (CTRC) \nfrom the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, indicate seven relatively large \ntransactions involving Applicant.22 On various occasions during that time period, they \nused funds from his home equity line of credit and credit cards to fund the trips to \ncasinos.23 They purchased chips or tokens from three different casinos in the following \n \n \n10 Id.

The girlfriend moved out of the house in 1997, and about that same time, he \nmet with a bankruptcy attorney. In October 1997, he filed for bankruptcy, and his \nunsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in \nJanuary 1998.35  \n \nFrom 1997 until 2006, Applicant continued traveling to casinos for weekends, \nthree times per year,36 primarily to join with friends from the Vietnamese community for \nfun and to watch musical entertainment.37 He spent approximately $1,000 on each trip, \nincluding travel, lodging, entertainment, and gambling.38  \n \nIn October 2000, Applicant sold the residence he owned with his girlfriend, and \nreceived $39,075 at settlement.39 Of that amount, pursuant to a previous agreement, \n \n24 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 22, at 2. \n \n25 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 22, at 3. \n \n26 Id. at 4. \n \n27 Id. at 5. \n \n28 Id. at 7. \n \n29 Id. at 8. \n \n30 Id. at 6. \n \n31 Personal Subject Interview, supra note 18, at 5. \n \n32 Id. at 5-6.  \n \n33 Id. at 6; Tr. at 23. \n \n34 Id.

As of April 2010, he had a vested balance of over $71,600 in one of his \n401(k) accounts,43 and over $101,025 in another one of his 401(k) accounts.44 His \ncredit scores, as of March 2010, range between 718 and 739.45 Applicant\u2019s annual \nsalary is $85,000.46 His salary is sufficient to pay all of his normal monthly expenses.47 \nAccording to the most recent credit report in evidence, Applicant pays each of his open \naccounts as agreed.48 He has no negative accounts or collections \n49\n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nDuring an interview conducted by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on March 2, 2006, Applicant was questioned about his gambling \nactivities. It appears that the question was \u201cif he gambles.\u201d50 He initially denied that he \ngambles, but when shown the CTRC reports, he modified his response.51 The \nGovernment contends his initial response constituted providing false information during \nthe security clearance process. Applicant was subsequently asked about his concept of \nthe word \u201cgamble,\u201d as well as to describe his actions in the casinos. He believes \ngambling is to make money.52 If you \u201cplay a little bit\u201d while hanging out waiting for a \nshow to start, that is not gambling, it is \u201cjust for fun.\u201d53 He contends his primary purpose \nwas to drive his girlfriend to the casinos and wait for her while she played.

Applicant is described \nas very industrious, trustworthy, honest, dedicated, highly respected, resourceful, \ncreative, and diligent.55 In his 2009 annual performance appraisal, his immediate \nsupervisor gave Applicant an overall rating of \u201cmeets/occasionally exceeds \nexpectations.\u201d56   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d57 As Commander in Chief, \nthe President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access \nto such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d58   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \n \n \n54 Id. at 41. \n \n55 Applicant Exhibit A (Character Reference, undated); Applicant Exhibit B (Character Reference, dated \nNovember 4, 2009); Applicant Exhibit H (Character Reference, dated April 10, 2010); Applicant Exhibit I (Character \nReference, dated April 18, 2010). \n \n56 Applicant Exhibit C (2009 Annual Appraisal, dated May 4, 2009), at 5. \n \n57 Department of the Navy v.

Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d61 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d62 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n59 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Also, under \u00b6 19(i), \u201ccompulsive or addictive gambling as indicated \nby an unsuccessful attempt to stop gambling, \u201cchasing losses\u201d (i.e. increasing the bets \nor returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling losses, \nborrowing money to fund gambling or paying gambling debts, family conflict or other \nproblems caused by gambling,\u201d is potentially disqualifying. \n \nAs noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until about \n1994, when his spouse-like relationship with his girlfriend, the mother of his two \ndaughters, started to encounter difficulties associated with her gambling. As noted \nabove, he gambled to a limited degree, playing slot machines and roulette, because he \ndid not really enjoy gambling, but his girlfriend did it as a hobby, and had a serious \nproblem with gambling. As co-applicants on several credit cards and credit lines, with \nhis acquiescence, she used those cards and lines to fund her gambling activities. Over \ntime, they purchased $75,600 worth of chips or tokens. Unable to keep up with \npayments because of her gambling activities, and with credit card debt rising to \n$40,000, accounts became delinquent. At about the same time his girlfriend moved out \nof the house in 1997, he met with a bankruptcy attorney, and in October 1997, he filed \nfor bankruptcy. His unsecured debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the U.S. \nBankruptcy Code in January 1998. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(i) only \npartially applies, for while he did \u201cborrow\u201d money to fund gambling, the gambling was \nhis girlfriend\u2019s gambling, not his own, and the compulsion or addictive nature of the \ngambling was hers and not his. Furthermore, the family conflict was generated not by \nhis gambling, but rather because he could not prevail upon his girlfriend to stop doing \nso. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n\u00b6 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially \nmitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@63  \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous financial problems commenced in 1994, and ceased in late \n1997, with his discharge in bankruptcy. Because he no longer resides with his girlfriend, \nand has not done so for over 10 years, and is now married to another woman, the \ncircumstances of his girlfriend\u2019s gambling compulsion and its impact on his finances are \nnot likely to recur. Likewise, his financial difficulties commenced due to her compulsion \nand his somewhat irresponsible acquiescence in permitting her to use credit cards and \nlines of credit, thereby enabling her behavior. Her gambling compulsion was a condition \nthat was largely beyond his control. By attempting to curtail her gambling or use of the \ncredit cards and lines of credit, he eventually acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant receives significant application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) for \nstopping the compulsive gambling of his girlfriend and separating from her. \n \nLikewise, Applicant\u2019s actions merit substantial application of AG \u00b6 20(b), for while \nhe may not have received counseling for his girlfriend\u2019s gambling compulsion, as far as \nhis financial situation is concerned, since the discharge of his unsecured debts in 1997, \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation has improved dramatically to the point where it appears \nthat any former gambling issues are fully resolved. He now is a homeowner with \noutstanding credit, a continuing good salary, and substantial savings. With his \ngirlfriend\u2019s absence, and his efforts to remain debt-free following his 1997 bankruptcy, \nhis financial difficulties have been resolved.64  \n \n63 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Dec. 1, 1999)).  \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because of the Appeal Board\u2019s earlier quoted decision \nthat \u201can applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the \nbenefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].\u201d65  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15:  \n      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other \nofficial government representative,\u201d may raise security concerns. Similarly, under AG \u00b6 \n16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding. . . \u201d may raise security concerns.  \n \nDuring his OPM interview on March 2, 2006, Applicant was questioned about his \ngambling activities, and apparently asked \u201cif he gambles.\u201d He initially denied that he did, \nbut when shown the CTRC reports, he modified his response. The Government \ncontends that initial response constituted providing false information during the security \nclearance process. While Applicant may have initially given a negative response, there \nis no evidence that his response was a deliberate attempt to provide false or misleading \ninformation. Obviously, from a cursory review of the CTRC records, it looks as though \nApplicant was funding his gambling compulsion and might have been attempting to \nminimize it. However, upon further examination and consideration, the combination of \nhis girlfriend\u2019s gambling compulsion, his minimum participation in gambling, and his \napparently somewhat limited English abilities, I can find no evidence of a deliberate \nfalsification. There is only some confusion over the meaning of the word \u201cgambling.\u201d I \nfind Applicant\u2019s explanations are credible in his denial of deliberate falsification.66 AG \u00b6 \n16(b) has not been established.  \n \n \n65 See ISCR Case No. 02-30304, supra note 63, at 3. \n \n66 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving \nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. For three years \nhe experienced financial difficulties by enabling his girlfriend\u2019s gambling compulsion by \nhis somewhat irresponsible acquiescence in permitting her to use credit cards and lines \nof credit. That compulsion resulted in the use of $75,600 worth of financial assets and \nan eventual bankruptcy in 1997. Eventually, he resolved to stop the situation, and he \nand his girlfriend parted ways. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant intervened in his girlfriend\u2019s compulsive gambling and cut off her pool of funds \nwhen he declared bankruptcy and they split up. It is significant that once his financial \ndelinquencies were resolved, and his relationship was dissolved, he no longer \nexperienced financial difficulties. To the contrary, he has become a model citizen, \nhusband, caring father, and good credit risk. His financial portfolio is now outstanding. \nAnd, he has not been to a casino for gambling or even entertainment since 2006.  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved or his \ngambling activities are under control; it is whether his financial circumstances raise \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any one \nfactor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s credit history and personal conduct \nin an unsympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of \nthe totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \n \nintent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally \npermissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case \nunder Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to \nexplain the omission. \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nanalysis.67 His overall efforts and evidence to satisfactorily explain the circumstances \nhighlighted in the SOR, are sufficient to mitigate any continuing security concerns. See \nAG \u00b6 2(a)(1) through AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:68 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nEver since Applicant separated from his girlfriend and had his unsecured debts \ndischarged in 1997, there are a significant positive signs in Applicant\u2019s favor that are \nsufficient to show he can \u201clive within [his] means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations.\u201d See AG \u00b6 18. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without substantial \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations and rebutted the personal conduct alleged. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n67 See U.S. v.

Edmunds, Esquire\nJuly 6, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on January 5, 2006.  On December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline B for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 1, 2009.  He answered\nthe SOR in writing through counsel on January 30, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on February 5, 2009, and\nthe case was originally assigned to another Judge on April 27, 2009.  It was reassigned\nto the undersigned on May 4, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2009,\n\n2\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 27, 2009.  The Government offered\nExhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through H, without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 2, 2009.  The record closed\non May 27, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Syria and Iraq.  The request was granted.  The request, and\nthe attached documents, were not admitted into evidence, but were included in the\nrecord.  Applicant\u2019s counsel also asked that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nrelating to the Middle East and additional facts relating to Iraq.  The request was also\ngranted.  The requests, and the attached documents, were not admitted into evidence,\nbut were included in the record.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations styled in the\nsubparagraphs of the SOR, without explanations.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant was born in Bagdad, Iraq, but came to the U.S. in 1987 (TR at\npage 25 line 8 to page 27 line 19).  He received an advanced degree from an American\nuniversity, became a U.S. citizen, and is now employed by a government contractor in\n\u201csupport to all our troops and our Government in the effort in Iraq\u201d (Id, and TR at page\n51 lines 3~15).  His direct supervisor, an U.S. Army Captain, gives the Applicant tops\nmarks in all aspects of his job in Iraq (AppXs E~G).  He works in Iraq on four month\ncycles, and then spends two weeks of leave with his family (AppXs A, B, and E~G).  His\nprimary residence is in the U.S., where he lives with his wife and four daughters (TR at\npage 46 line 6 to page 48 line 20).  His wife is \u201can assistant teacher\u201d (Id).  His annual\nincome is about $200,000, and he has about $130,000 in savings (TR at page 46 line 6\nto page 48 line 20).\n1.a.~1.c. and 1.f.  The Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Iraq, but resides in Syria\nwith one of the Applicant\u2019s sisters (TR at page 31 line 19 to page 32 line 5).  She is 81\nyears of age, and has \u201calways [been] a housewife;\u201d and as such, she has never worked\nfor any foreign government (TR at page 55 lines 1~5, and at page 59 line 3~5).  In the\npast, he would send his mother about $200 each month (TR at page 31 line 23 to page\n32 line 5, see also at page 28 line 20 to page 30 line 11).  The Applicant ceased this\npractice \u201c[a]bout seven months ago\u201d (Id).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s sister is also a citizen of Iraq (TR at page 62 line 18 to page 64 line\n14).  She \u201cis a housewife;\u201d and as such, does not work for any foreign government (Id).\nHer husband is deceased (TR at page 62 line 18 to page 64 line 14).  Both this sister\nand Applicant\u2019s mother have formally applied to immigrate to the U.S. (Id).  Neither his\nmother nor his sister know that the Applicant works for the U.S. Government (TR at\npage 69 lines 15~20).\n1.c.  The Applicant has another sister who is a citizen of Iraq, but now resides in\nthe United Arab Emirates (TR at page 59 line 21 to page 62 line 17).  \u201cShe is a retired\nteacher\u201d (Id).  Her husband is also deceased (TR at page 59 line 21 to page 62 line 17).\nShe has no affiliation with any foreign government (Id).  This sister does not know that\nthe Applicant works for the U.S. Government (TR at page 59 line 21 to page 62 line 17).\n1.d.  The Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq (TR at page\n69 line 21 to page 70 line 4).  She is 74 years of age, and \u201ca housewife\u201d (Id).  Her\nhusband is deceased, and she, through Appellant\u2019s wife, has formally applied to\nimmigrate to the U.S. (TR at page 71 lines 1~8).\n1.e., 1.g. and 1.i.  The Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen of Iraq, but resides in the\nU.S. (TR at page 32 line 17 to page 33 line 11).  He \u201cowns a construction business\u201d in\nthe U.S. (TR at page 76 line 1 to page 77 line 17).  At one time, this brother lived in\nJordan, and the Applicant visited his brother and other family members in Jordan in\n2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008 (TR at page 78 line 6 to page 85 line 10).  The Applicant\nonce owned property in Iraq, but sold this property to his brother for future consideration\n(TR at page 86 line 16 to page 88 line 11).\n1.h.  The Applicant had another brother who was a citizen and resident of Iraq,\nbut he was killed by terrorists in about 2006 (TR at page 28 lines 5~14, and at page 35\nlines 5~11).\nThe Applicant testified that he would not be subject to coercion by any foreign\ngovernment vis-a-vis those of his relatives who do not live in the U.S. (TR at page 36\nlines 8~13).  Any such attempt at coercion would be reported to \u201cU.S. authorities, and to\n. . . [his] company\u201d (Id).\nI also take administrative notice of the following facts.  Since 1963, Syria has\nbeen ruled by an authoritarian regime.  It is currently included on the State\nDepartment\u2019s list of states that sponsor terrorism.  Due to Syria\u2019s active and passive\nsupport of terrorism, trade and commercial sanctions were implemented against Syria in\n2004, 2006 and in 2008.  In 2007, the State Department noted that its human rights\nrecord had worsened.  Iraq, on the other hand, is a valuable partner with the U.S. in the\nwar on terrorism, but violence continues to engulf the country.  Furthermore, there\ncontinue to be reports of human rights abuses in Iraq.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or induced\nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, AG \u00b6 7(a) is applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family member . . . who is\na citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  The Applicant\u2019s\nmother and one sibling live in Syria, and his mother in-law lives in Iraq.  This is clearly\ncountered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . . . are such that it\nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  All of the Applicant\u2019s\nsurviving relatives noted in the SOR have either immigrated to the U.S., or have\nformally applied for immigration status.\nAG \u00b6 7(b) is also arguably applicable: \u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person .\n. . by providing information.\u201d  This is clearly countered, however, by AG \u00b6 8(b), as \u201cthere\nis no conflict of interest, . . . because . . . the individual has such a deep and\nlongstanding relationship and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  The Applicant has lived in\nthe U.S. for more than 20 years.  All of his wealth and possessions are here.\nFurthermore, his wife, children, and soon most of his family that are of concern to the\nGovernment, will reside in the U.S.  I have no doubt as to his loyalties to the U.S.\nFinally, the fourth mitigating condition is also applicable, as \u201cthe foreign . . .\nactivities are on U.S. Government business . . . .\u201c  He works as a U.S. government\ncontractor in support of the U.S.\u2019s mission in Iraq.  Furthermore, he can not be coerced\nby Syria or Iraq.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\n\n6\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHe has the unqualified support of the U.S. military, as evidenced by letters of\nsupport, and certificates of appreciation (AppXs A~D).  A Deputy Commanding Officer\nof an Infantry Brigade stationed in Iraq avers, in part, the following:\n[The Applicant] . . . is a man of great dedication and selfless sacrifice to\nAmerica\u2019s mission to assist their Iraqi allies.  I fully endorse his request for\na clearance to handle classified material (AppX B).\nI have considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his alleged Foreign Influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn August 28, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF\n86) to obtain access to classified information as part of his job with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On May 5, 2009, DOHA\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security\nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines replace the guidelines listed in Enclosure\n2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7.\n3\n Id. \n4\n2\nconcerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E\n2\n(personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).\nOn May 12, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision\nwithout a hearing. On June 17, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. The FORM\n3\nincluded five documents (Exhibits 1 - 5) proffered in support of the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant received the FORM on June 23, 2009. He was advised that he had 30 days\nfrom receipt of the FORM to file a response and additional information.  On July 18,\n4\n2009, Applicant submitted a two-page letter and one document attached thereto.\n(Applicant\u2019s Response) Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s responsive\nsubmission and the case was assigned to me on August 19, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR listed allegations that Applicant deliberately falsified\nhis July 3, 2007, security clearance application (SF 86) because he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 27 (illegal drug use in  the previous seven years), when he had actually used\nmarijuana between September 2005 and May 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that Applicant\ndeliberately withheld relevant information about his drug use when, during three\nseparate subject interviews with government investigators in July and August 2007, he\nfailed to disclose his use of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that on August 28, 2008, he\ndeliberately falsified a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) because, in\nresponse to question 24.a (illegal drug use in the previous seven years), he stated he\nhad used marijuana between August 2005 and April 2006, when he had actually used\nmarijuana until at least May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that, because of the falsifications\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant\u2019s clearance was revoked by another\ngovernment agency in December 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR listed an allegation that Applicant\u2019s falsifications\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, if shown to be deliberate, constituted criminal\nconduct in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) Applicant admitted all but one\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts entered in the record\nthrough Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old technical staff member with a degree in Aerospace\nEngineering from a prestigious university. Since June 2007, when he graduated from\ncollege, he has worked for a defense contractor in a position that requires a security\nclearance. While Applicant was in college, he occasionally smoked marijuana with\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n3\nfriends. His use was moderate, and occurred between about September 2005 (the\nbeginning of his third year in school) and May 2007. He has not used any other illegal\ndrug, has never trafficked in illegal drugs for personal profit, has never had any adverse\ncontact with law enforcement for drug-related conduct, and he has never been treated\nor counseled for a drug problem. (FORM, Exhibits 3 - 5; Applicant\u2019s Response to\nFORM)\nIn July 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) to\nobtain a clearance for work in support of an agency other than the Department of\nDefense. He deliberately omitted any mention of his marijuana use when he answered\n\u201cno\u201d to SF 86 question 27, which asked if he had used, possessed, or otherwise been\ninvolved with illegal drugs over the preceding seven years. In the subsequent\nbackground investigation, Applicant was interviewed by government investigators three\ntimes in July 2007 and August 2007, but he did not disclose his marijuana use during\nany of those interviews. (FORM, Exhibit 5) On December 19, 2007, his request for a\nsecurity clearance was denied based on his drug use, and on his deliberate falsification\nof the SF 86 and his failure to disclose his drug use in any of the three subject\ninterviews. (FORM, Exhibits 3 and 5)\nOn August 28, 2008, Applicant submitted another SF 86 to request a security\nclearance. In response to question 24.a, which asked if he had used or otherwise been\ninvolved with illegal drugs in the preceding seven years, Applicant answered \u201cyes,\u201d but\ndisclosed only that he had used marijuana about eight times between August 2005 and\nApril 2006. (FORM, Gx. 4) In response to the SOR allegation that he deliberately\nfalsified this answer, Applicant acknowledged the answer he gave was incorrect, but\naverred that he \u201chad no intention of further lying\u201d after his 2007 interviews about his\ndrug use. He further characterized his answer as \u201can unintentional contradiction.\u201d\n(FORM, Gx. 3)\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully make a false\nstatement or representation to any department or agency of the United States\nconcerning a matter within its jurisdiction. Violation of this statute is punishable by five\nyears in jail, a substantial fine, or both.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n4\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 15\n(Guideline E - personal conduct) and AG \u00b6 30 (Guideline J - criminal conduct).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct\nThe government presented sufficient information, along with Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, to support the allegations that he deliberately falsified his 2007 SF 86 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a); that he deliberately did not disclose his drug use during three interviews with\ngovernment investigators in 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that his request for clearance for\nwork with another agency was denied because of his drug use and falsifications in 2007\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant denied deliberately falsifying his August 2008 SF 86 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c). However, all of the available information on this issue (his multiple previous\n\n5\nfalsifications and the lack of a plausible explanation for why he did not disclose the true\nscope of his drug use) tends to show that, even after the 2007 denial of his first request\nfor clearance, he again engaged in a deliberate falsification of information the\ngovernment needs to make an informed decision about whether Applicant is suitable for\naccess to sensitive information. The facts established raise security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct as addressed in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nApplicants are required to provide truthful answers at all times during the\ninvestigative and adjudicative process. Withholding relevant information about one\u2019s\nbackground can potentially impede the government\u2019s ability to make an accurate\ndecision about granting access to sensitive information. Applicant deliberately lied to the\ngovernment about his drug use on at least five occasions through two security\nquestionnaires and three subject interviews. These facts require application of the\ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities), and at AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative).\nIn response, Applicant has not presented information that would support\napplication of any of the pertinent mitigating factors listed under AG \u00b6 17. He did not try\nto correct his omissions before being confronted with the facts (AG \u00b6 17(a)), although\nthere is no information in the FORM that shows he was interviewed after his second\napplication for a clearance. Nor has Applicant established that his omissions resulted\nfrom mistake or improper advice, or that they were infrequent and not recent. (AG \u00b6\n17(b)) Moreover, Applicant did not establish that his falsifications no longer reflect\nadversely on his current judgment and reliability. On balance, he has failed to mitigate\nthe security concerns about his personal conduct.\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant admitted he knowingly and deliberately made at least four false\nstatements to the government in 2007. Available information also shows, despite his\napparent denial of SOR \u00b6 1.c, that he made another intentionally false statement in\n2008. The matters at issue (his use of illegal drugs) were within the jurisdiction of the\ngovernment agencies to which the statements or representations were made.\nAccordingly, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 applies to make Applicant\u2019s falsifications potential\nviolations of federal criminal law. The security concern raised by these circumstances is\nthat such conduct \u201ccreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n9\n6\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30.\nMore specifically, Applicant\u2019s conduct requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6\n31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). By contrast, Applicant\u2019s information\ndoes not support application of any of the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 32. His\nfalsifications were deliberate, multiple and recent; and he has presented no information\nto show that his conduct, which is directly at odds with the most fundamental tenets of\nthe industrial security program, does not cast doubt on his current judgment and\nreliability.  Further, he has not presented sufficient information showing he has learned\nfrom his past conduct and is not likely to repeat it. Accordingly, neither AG \u00b6 32(a) (so\nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), nor AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) apply. \nThe mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced\ninto committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person's life)\nand AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) do not apply.\nApplicant has admitted to all but one of the allegations of deliberate falsification, and he\nhas not presented information showing he was pressured or coerced into doing so. In\nsummary, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns about his criminal\nconduct.\nWhole Person Concept \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and J. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 24 years\nold and holds a college degree in a demanding field of study from a prestigious\nuniversity. Thus, it is reasonable to presume he is a mature, intelligent adult. However,\nthe weight of the information presented shows he has a history of intentionally lying\nabout adverse information in his background. He has repeatedly engaged in such\nconduct despite possible criminal sanctions and despite having already been denied a\nsecurity clearance for making false statements. There is no information in this record\nabout any other facet of his background that sufficiently counters the adverse\ninformation underlying the security concerns about his deliberate falsifications. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s\n9\ncircumstances and background shows he has yet to establish a record of candor and\ntrustworthiness the government requires before it can trust him to safeguard its\nsensitive information. Until he can demonstrate such traits, doubts will remain about his\nsuitability for access to such information. Because protection of the national interest is\n\n See footnote 8, supra. \n10\n7\nparamount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the\ngovernment.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: William Savarino, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn February 1, 2007, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86 or e-QIP). On March 24, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines M (Use of Information Technology Systems) and E (Personal Conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 31, 2010. He answered \nthe SOR in writing through counsel on April 13, 2010, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. DOHA received the request on April 15, 2010. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on August 12, 2010, and I received the case \nassignment on September 18, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September 8, \n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 6, 2010. The Government \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 30, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Exhibits A and B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on October 14, 2010. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the Guideline M allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b of \nthe SOR. He denied \u00b6 1.c, with explanation. Applicant admitted and denied parts of the \nPersonal Conduct concerns alleged in \u00b6 2.a through \u00b6 2.c. He denied the allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 2d, 2.e, and 2.g. Applicant admitted the allegation in \u00b6\u00b6 2.f. He also provided \nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. He served \nseven years on active duty in the Navy. He is married and has two children. Since his \nseparation from the Navy in 1998, Applicant has worked in the field of information \ntechnology (computers) for several defense contractors. Applicant is a database \nadministrator for his present employer for whom he has worked since 2007. His current \nemployer is a government contractor to the Navy. Applicant has held a top secret \nclearance since 1988. (Tr. 83-85, 91, 144, 150, 199; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nAs a database administrator, Applicant shared group passwords with other \nadministrators. Applicant had 7 to 30 passwords to remember each day, and would \nguess his password or a group password if it were necessary. As an administrator, he \ncould not research an existing password if someone in the user group forgot their \npassword. Applicant could only assign a new password if the existing password was \nforgotten or lost. This practice of guessing passwords in such circumstances was \ncommonplace in his company and his computer experience. There were no company \npolicies on the sharing of passwords by database administrators, except the guessing of \nsomeone else\u2019s password when it is not a situation of helping the person remember \ntheir password or another administrator recollect the group password for work purposes \nis considered hacking in the computer business. (Tr. 95-106, 178, 181, 183; Exhibits 2, \n3) \n \n \nApplicant used outside disks and other media on company computers during his \ncivilian work career since 1988. He did so only to improve the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the company\u2019s computer systems. Applicant made certain to scan all \nsuch outside disks and media using company issued anti-virus screening software prior \nto inserting such into his employer\u2019s computer system. In Applicant\u2019s 13 years of \nworking as a government contractor, this practice of scanning outside media before \nusing it on a company computer was common in the industry. The company\u2019s policy \nwas that the person who brought in the outside media was initially responsible for \nscreening it for viruses.  \n \nApplicant was never admonished by his supervisors for any of his actions \ninvolving the use of outside media on company computers. Applicant thought he was \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfollowing all standard Navy and company procedures. The computers Applicant \nmanaged were not connected to the internet or any computer outside of the company\u2019s \nnetwork. The Government did not offer any evidence that the Navy or Applicant\u2019s \ncompany had policies, rules or procedures that prohibited this practice. Applicant \nintroduced software patches into the computers to repair errors in software. That \nprocess was also routine in the industry and Applicant\u2019s experience. (Tr. 106-111, 166, \n184-188; Exhibits 2, 3)  \n \n \nApplicant took company office supplies, e.g., staplers, pads, computer mice, \npaperclips, and paper home to do company work. Applicant\u2019s manager was aware he \nwas taking office supplies home, and his supervisors did not object. Other employees \nalso took office supplies home, with the understanding the items would be used for \ncompany business. (Tr. 111-116) \n \n \nApplicant never had classified material in his workplace. He never took classified \ninformation home. Applicant did take home documents, which included company \npropriety data. When transporting this material, Applicant kept it locked in the trunk of \nhis car or on his person. Applicant did not have his manager\u2019s authorization to take \ncompany information. (Tr. 117-125) \n \n \nApplicant expanded administrative accounts when he was installing software on \ncompany computers. He used a particular command on the computer that allowed him \nto make the installation, but it also recorded an audit trail about what action was taken. \nOnly super-users were to use this command. Applicant used it, and thought he had the \nauthority to use it because the installation proceeded as planned. No one from his \nemployer told Applicant his actions exceeded his authority. (Tr. 127-130) \n \n \nApplicant removed an acronym for his company from the label on a media disk. \nSecurity banners on unclassified and/or For Official Use Only (FOUO) documents that \nhe brought home to use in his home office did not have a sensitive material label on \nthem. One time, in 2001, Applicant removed a label on a document because it \ncontained the name of the machine and the acronym for the Navy command for which \nhe worked. He shredded that label. Applicant did not verify the sensitivity level of the \ndisk, nor whether he should have taken it from the facility, before he removed it. \nHowever, he did not see any label requiring that the document remain on the \nemployer\u2019s premises. The document remains in his home safe with the tag excised. (Tr. \n119-127, 130-133) \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose on his February 2007 SF-86, the adverse security \ndecision by another federal agency \u201cdisapproving\u201d him access to sensitive compartment \ninformation (SCI) in 2004. Specifically, Question 26 B, asked Applicant: \n \nTo your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access \nauthorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been \ndebarred from government employment? [An administrative downgrade or \ntermination of a security clearance is not a revocation.]  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant thought this adverse decision was an administrative determination \ninstead of a denial. The language used in the agency decision was that it \u201cdisapproved \nyou for access to classified information.\u201d In its February 13, 2004 decision, the other \nfederal agency took this adverse action because of alleged security violations, misuse \nof information technology systems, and personal conduct. These allegations stem from \nan interview conducted by a polygraph examiner. The examiner questioned Applicant \nover the course of three days. He inquired as to Applicant\u2019s removal of items from his \nemployer\u2019s offices, and \u201cmultiple attempts to enter classified and unclassified \ninformation technology systems without proper authorization.\u201d The agency also stated in \nits February 13, 2004 letter that Applicant \u201cchanged your access on other systems and \nbroadened your area access, without authorization. You also knowingly circumvented \nsecurity procedures.\u201d Furthermore, the agency stated Applicant admitted he removed \ndisks and hard copy information from the workplace without authorization. \u201cYou advised \ntaking home classified information with banner pages intact and then cutting them off \nand shredding them.\u201d (Exhibit 3) \n \nWhen Applicant answered Question 26 B he \u201cbelieved their action to be \nadministrative and considered it a termination, because up to that point, I had been at \n(the agency) doing unclassified work.\u201d When this decision was made, Applicant was \nremoved from that project (working for the other federal agency) and sent to work on \nanother (unrelated) project. He considered himself terminated from the project with the \nother federal agency. In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant freely supplied a \ncopy of the February 2004 letter from the other federal agency. He did not appeal the \nother agency\u2019s decision because he continued to maintain his Top Secret clearance, so \nin his estimation he did not lose anything by the decision. (Tr. 92, 133-139, 147, 152-\n157, 164; Exhibits 1, 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant did share group passwords while he worked at the other federal \nagency. He guessed his own passwords at that agency and expanded the authority of \nthe group account. To his knowledge he did not violate any explicit instructions of that \nagency regarding computer use. (Tr. 139, 140) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor testified on his behalf. They worked together for \nfour years. She considered him thorough and careful in his work. They are peers now at \ntheir present employer. In her experience, the sharing of passwords is common for \ndatabase administrators to do. She was not aware of any prohibition on the sharing of \npasswords. She would bring in outside disks and other media from her home, scan \nthem with anti-virus software, and insert them into their employer\u2019s computer system. \nShe, and other staff members, routinely took office supplies home to work on company \nbusiness. This witness never saw any \u201cFOUO\u201d documents. She was not aware of any \ncompany policy about taking documents home to work on company issued laptops. She \nwas also not aware of any restrictions on Applicant\u2019s authority to install software on their \nemployer\u2019s computer system, and grant access privileges. This witness never saw any \nsecurity banners on documents at their company. On occasion she would guess what \nher password was to enter her computer. (Tr. 25-51) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nThe president of Applicant\u2019s present employer also testified on Appellant\u2019s \nbehalf. He explained his background in consulting on computers and the employment of \nApplicant. His company does not have a policy prohibiting the guessing of passwords. \nThe company does not have restrictions on \u201cFOUO\u201d documents being taken home. His \ncompany does not have restrictions on broadening access. Where he works there are \nno security banners or sensitive material designations. He employs Applicant also as a \ndata transfer agent in his capacity as a database administrator. Two weeks earlier the \nNavy changed its policy of bringing in outside media to prohibit or restrict it. Prior to this, \nno such prohibition existed at their workplace. (Tr. 52-80) \n \n \nApplicant answered all questions directly and without hesitation. He explained \nthe nature of his work and his background in computers. Applicant was credible and \npersuasive in his presentation.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes eight conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or \ncomponent thereof; \n \n(b) illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial \nof access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information \ntechnology system; \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified information on or to any \nunauthorized software, hardware, or information technology system; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem; \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations; \n \n(g) negligence or lax security habits in handling information technology \nthat persist despite counseling by management; and \n \n(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, \nthat results in damage to the national security. \n \n \nFour disqualifying conditions may apply. AG \u00b6 40 (a) and (c) apply to any illegal \nor unauthorized entry into an information technology system or component thereof, and \nthe use of any such system to gain unauthorized access to another system or a \ncompartmented area within the same system. Applicant was guessing passwords to \ngain entry into computer systems. He installed software in computer systems to which \nhe was not authorized access. His entry of code that mimicked a \u201csuper-user\u201d allowed \nhim access for his installation work. Appellant testified no one ever told him his work \nwas not authorized. It did exceed his authority. \n \n \nThe third condition is the unauthorized use of a government or other information \ntechnology system. Applicant was the database manager for his employers. He \nadmitted he guessed his own computer password when he could not remember it \namongst the 30 he had within his control. He admitted he shared group passwords with \nother contractors and other authorized personnel to access his employer\u2019s computers \nfor work purposes. AG \u00b6 40 (e) applies.  \n \n \nThe fourth condition involves the introduction of media into his company\u2019s \ninformation technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines or regulations. Applicant admitted he engaged in the introduction \nof media from his home laptop computer into the company\u2019s computers for work \npurposes only. Also, he always screened any media with anti-virus software. He added \nsoftware to the company computers while appearing to be a \u201csuper-user,\u201d which status \nhe did not have. No rules, regulations, procedures, or guidelines that prohibited this \nconduct were submitted as exhibits. Applicant denied there were any such rules or \nprocedures. He acted in accordance with what he knew or thought he knew to be the \ncompany procedures. However, AG \u00b6 40 (f) applies because he did not have the \nauthority to be a \u201csuper-user\u201d and introduce software and media into a computer \nsystem. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and, \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor. \n \n \nAll of these mitigating conditions apply based upon the evidence in the record. \nThe first mitigating condition provides that the behavior happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s integrity. \nThe testimony of Applicant and his two witnesses showed the SOR allegations were \ncommonplace practice within the last two companies for whom Applicant worked. He is \nthe database administrator and had to take these actions to help keep the company \noperating on a daily basis. AG \u00b6 41 (a) applies. \n \n \nThe misuse, if any, by Applicant was minor and done only to make the \norganization\u2019s computers operate more efficiently and effectively. Applicant only \nguessed at his own password or group passwords that he was authorized to use as the \ndatabase administrator.  AG \u00b6 41 (b) applies.  \n \n \nOver the past 13 years Applicant has followed his employer\u2019s information \ntechnology rules and procedures. His actions were in conformity with the rules and \nprocedures as he understood them to be. Therefore, he did not act intentionally in a \nmalicious or criminal manner. He never compromised national security. Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor at his previous company and the president of his current employer both \ntestified that they had no concerns or problems with Applicant\u2019s work. To Applicant \nthere was no situation to correct because he was always following the correct \nprocedures all the time. No supervisor admonished or counseled him. AG \u00b6 41 (c) \napplies because any action that might have been contrary to a policy was inadvertent or \nunintentional, designed only to promote his employer\u2019s work for the client, and his \nsupervisors knew he was introducing the media as part of his standard actions. They \nknew and did nothing to stop Applicant, so they acquiesced in his actions. \n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative \ntermination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \n \nThe seven allegations in Paragraph 2 of the SOR fall within three disqualifying \nconditions. First, Applicant did not make full disclosure about a denial of a security \nclearance by another agency in 2004. Question 26 B on the SF-86 of February 2007 \nasked if Applicant had ever been denied. He answered \u201cno.\u201d The agency\u2019s letter uses \nthe word \u201cdisapproved.\u201d AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies.  \n \n \nThe remaining six allegations fall within the purview of both AG \u00b6 16 (c) and (d). \nThe allegations under Guidelines E and M when considered as a whole support a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules, or other characteristics indicating \nApplicant may not properly safeguard protected information. They also contain credible \nadverse information not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient individually for an adverse determination, but when combined with all available \n\n \n11 \n \n \ninformation would support a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he took office supplies from empty office cubicles to use at \nhome when doing company work. He denied he took multiple documents home without \nauthorization that had \u201cFOUO\u201d or sensitive designations on them. He admitted he \nbroadened administrative accounts without authority and to accomplish the company\u2019s \nwork.  \n \n \nNext, the allegation was made that Applicant was told his access was denied by \nanother agency in February 2004. The denial was based on security violations, misuse \nof information technology and personal conduct.  \n \n \nFinally, the three allegations in SOR Paragraph 1 were incorporated into \nParagraph 2 under personal conduct. Those allegations concern access to computer \nsystems, introduction of media into computer systems, and guessing passwords.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nThe falsification issue is a matter of semantics and Applicant\u2019s understanding of \nthe agency\u2019s action six years ago in 2004. The agency stated he was \u201cdisapproved.\u201d \nThe government alleges it was a denial and should have been disclosed. Applicant \nknew he had no security clearance at that agency so he assumed it was an \nadministrative determination that did not have to be disclosed in response to Question \n26 B. His understanding of the action is not a reasonable interpretation of the agency\u2019s \naction. He did not disclose an adverse action by the other agency concerning his SCI \nand security clearance application on his SF-86. That denial is an important fact to be \nconsidered by the government in deciding whether to grant Applicant another security \nclearance for five years. Applicant graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and served \nseven years on active naval duty. He knows what a falsification is and his duty to \ndisclose based on his experience as an officer and a corporate employee. He did not \ntake any action to correct his omission before being confronted with the facts.  \n \n \nThe other allegations are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 17 (c) because Applicant \nadmitted freely he did them and he continued to do them over several years. Taking \ncorporate property merely because someone else did is not justification for that action. \nRemoving sensitive material from the workplace, exceeding his authority on computer \noperations, and removing security banners are actions under the Personal Conduct \nGuideline that are not minor in their totality nor were they infrequent. These actions \nApplicant performed over several years and are likely to continue based on that \nprecedent. \n \n \nNo other mitigating conditions apply. No evidence concerning improper or \ninadequate advice from authorized personnel or legal counsel concerning the security \nclearance process was submitted by Applicant, so AG \u00b6 17 (b) does not apply. \nApplicant has not changed any of his behaviors to allow AG \u00b6 17 (d) to apply. No \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation or duress were taken. \nAG \u00b6 17 (e) does not apply. The information was substantiated and admitted by \nApplicant. AG \u00b6 17 (f) does not apply. Finally, there was no evidence or admission of \nany association with criminals, so AG \u00b6 17 (g) does not apply. \n  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the \u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Regarding information technology \nsystems, Applicant is an experienced former naval officer and database administrator. \nHe acted in his employment the way he thought was proper to accomplish the work for \nwhich he was hired. No employer or supervisor every counseled or disciplined him for \nhis actions. His witnesses showed his actions were within the industry norm and they \nhad no concerns about Applicant. Any conduct was motivated by a desire to keep his \ncompany\u2019s computers operating and to improve his work performance. \n \nHowever, Applicant did not make a full disclosure about his denial of a security \nclearance and SCI by another agency. The total number and type of actions Applicant \ntook regarding sensitive information and the computer systems under his control show \npersonal conduct that was done by an experienced and professional adult which was \nserious. It was also undertaken voluntarily and done frequently. There were no changes \nin the behavior over the past several years, the continuation of the actions is likely, and \nthere is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. These are not \nactions of an experienced professional, particularly the falsification of his questionnaire \nconcerning the denial of an earlier application for SCI and security clearance by another \nagency.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his use of information technology \nsystems. He did not mitigate the security concerns under personal conduct. I conclude \nthe \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a to 2.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 49 years old and submitted his security clearance application as a pre-employment requirement for a position with a defense contractor. He served 20 years on active duty as an avionic mechanic with the Army and retired on July 31, 1999 (Case file, DD 214, date July 31, 1999). Since retiring from active duty, he has worked at various positions as a contract employee for defense contractors. He also was a full time student. He anticipates employment in the defense industry.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on December 11, 2006 (Item 5).  He previously submitted a Public Trust \nPosition Application (SF 85P) on April 27, 2004 (Item 10).  On October 6, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nfor Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F, \nand for personal conduct under Guideline E (Item 1).  Two of the allegations under \nGuideline E concerned falsification of answers to financial questions on the Public Trust \nPosition Application.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 10, 2008 (Item 3). \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 27, 2008, admitting all of the \nallegations under both Guideline F and Guideline E.  He elected to have the matter \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s written case on December 30, 2008.  Applicant received a complete file \nof relevant material (FORM) on January 7, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to \nfile objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM or provide additional material.  The \ncase was assigned to me on March 3, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file and \npleadings, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and submitted his security clearance application as a \npre-employment requirement for a position with a defense contractor.  He served 20 \nyears on active duty as an avionic mechanic with the Army and retired on July 31, 1999 \n(Case file, DD 214, date July 31, 1999).  Since retiring from active duty, he has worked \nat various positions as a contract employee for defense contractors.  He also was a full \ntime student.  He anticipates employment in the defense industry.  He was married and \ndivorced, and has one child from that marriage that he supports through payment to a \nstate agency.  He remarried and has two children from that marriage. The children live \nin Panama with their grandparents.  Applicant and his wife are attempting to bring the \nchildren to the United States.  Applicant provides support for the children in Panama \n(Item 5, e-QIP, and Item 6, Answer to Interrogatories, dated August 19, 2008; Case file, \nPersonal Subject Interview, dated August 10, 2007).   \n \nCredit reports (Item 7, Credit report, dated July 2, 2007; Item 8, Credit report, \ndated January 3, 2007; and Item 9, Credit report, dated November 26, 2001) show 24 \ndelinquent debts for Applicant to include the following: an account placed in collection in \nMay 2005 for $921 (SOR 1.a); two medical debts placed in collection in October 2005 \nfor $260 (SOR 1.b) and $283 (SOR 1.c); a cable company debt placed in collection in \nApril 2004 for $341 (SOR 1.d); two debts placed in collection by the same creditor in \nOctober 2003 for $30 (SOR 1.e), and in July 2003 for $12 (SOR 1.f); a judgment in the \namount of $521 entered in December 2003 (SOR 1.g); a lien for $623 placed in July \n2007 (SOR 1.h); an account past due 120 days for over $1,000 on a balance of $3,714 \nin July 2008 (SOR 1.i); an account placed in collection for $136 in June 2008 (SOR 1.j); \na car repossession in June 2006 (SOR 1.k); an account past due over 180 days or more \nfor $1,000 on a balance of $1,235 (SOR 1.l); an account charged off for $815 in January \n2005 (SOR 1.m); a utility account charged off in January 2005 for $448 (SOR 1.n); an \naccount for a car placed in collection for $12,418 in June 2005 (SOR 1.o); an account \nplaced in collection for $1,948 in February 2004 (SOR 1.p); an account placed in \ncollection for $2,113 in June 2007 (SOR 1.q); an account placed in collection for $268 in \nJune 2007 (SOR 1.r); a cable account placed in collection for $268 in July 2002 (SOR \n1.s); a medical account for $30 placed in collection in February 2002 (SOR 1.t); a credit \ncard account past due over 120 days for $295 on a balance of $2,116 (SOR 1.u); an \naccount placed in collection for $695 in August 2001 (SOR 1.v); an account placed in \ncollection for $110 in January 2007 (SOR 1.w); and an account placed in collection for \n$51 in July 2000 (SOR 1.x).  Applicant admits all of these debts (Item 4, Response to \nSOR, dated October 27, 2008). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that he has been a contract \nworker for defense contractors since retiring from the Army in July 1999.  As a contract \nworker, he is required to move when jobs become available.  He never became a \npermanent worker for the defense contractors.  The frequent moves required him to \nleave his family behind and set up two households.  He had other additional expenses \nfrom moving to new locations.  He also notes the requirement to support his two \nchildren in Panama, and his daughter from his first marriage who is in college.  In a \npersonal financial statement attached to the Answer to Interrogatories, Applicant lists \nnet monthly income of $5,023, from a net salary of $3,748, and retired military pay of \n$1,275.  He lists recurring monthly expenses of $3,772, and debt payments of $860.95.  \nThis leaves $390.05 in net remainder for discretionary or disposable funds each month \n(Item 6, at 7-9).   \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator on August 9, 2007.  He \nstated concerning the debt at SOR 1.u, that he paid on the account for a short time, but \ndid not have the funds to continue paying after sometime in 2003.  In March 2007, he \nstarted paying $70 per month on the account.  However, he presented no information to \nshow the payments or any continuing payments.  Applicant also stated he is aware of \nthe debts listed on his credit report.  However, he claims they are not his debts.  After \nlearning in early 2007 of the debts on the credit report, he began to dispute the debts.  \nHe can only dispute one a month and has to wait until he receives a response from the \ncreditor.  He believes his identity has been compromised and he anticipates hiring an \nattorney to assist him.  Applicant also did not know the person who obtained the \njudgment against him listed in SOR 1.g.  He presented no information on previous \naction taken on any of these debts (Case file, Interview, dated August 9, 2007, at 1).  \nApplicant did not present any information on any anticipated action to be taken by him \non any of these debts. \n \nIn response to financial questions on his e-QIP, Applicant responded \"NO\" to \nquestion 27b asking whether in the last seven years he had any property repossessed.  \nApplicant admits the June 2006 car repossession at SOR 1.k.  Applicant responded \n\"NO\" to question 27d asking if in the last seven years he had any judgments placed \nagainst him.  He admits the judgment placed against him in December 2003 at SOR \n1.g.  Applicant responded \"NO\" to question 28a asking if in the last seven years he had \nany debt more than 180 days past due.  At the time, he had at least 17 debts more than \n180 days past due as noted in the SOR.  He answered \"YES\" to question 28b asking if \nhe presently had any debt more than 90 days past due.  He listed only one of his debts \nthat were currently more than 90 days past due (Item 5, e-QIP, dated December 11, \n2006).  Applicant admits he provided false information in response to these questions. \n \nIn response to financial questions on the SF 85P he submitted on April 27, 2004, \nApplicant answered \"NO\" to question 19 asking if in the last seven years there were any \njudgments against him.  He did not list the judgment at SOR 1.g.  Applicant answered \n\"YES\" to question 20 asking about delinquent debts more than 180 days past due, \nApplicant listed only one debt but had at least ten delinquent debts at the time more \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthan 180 days past due.  Applicant admits he provided false information in response to \nthese questions. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s 24 delinquent debts established by credit reports and \nApplicant's admissions are a security concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\"; and \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial obligations\".  Applicant accumulated \ndelinquent debts because he made little if any effort to pay his financial obligations.  \nWhile Applicant noted that he had not been steadily employed by his employers since \nhe retired from active military duty in 1999, and had to move frequently, he presented \nno information to establish how these circumstances hindered his ability to make some \npayments toward his delinquent debts.  The delinquent debts appear to be from normal \nconsumer spending rather than under unusual circumstances.   \n \n \nI considered all of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \nand none apply.  The debts have not been paid and are still outstanding, making them \ncurrent debts which cast doubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment (AG \u00b6 20(a)).  Applicant claims he was required to move frequently to \nmaintain employment, had to maintain two households, and had to provide support for \nhis children at another location.  He presented no information on how or why these \nevents impacted his ability to make some payments on his debts.  In fact, Applicant \nseems to have been gainfully employed for significant periods, and he has a monthly \npositive cash flow indicating some ability to pay delinquent debts (AG \u00b6 20(b)).  He \npresented no information indicating he sought or received financial counseling to assist \nhim in his delinquent debt management (AG \u00b6 20(c)).  He presented no information on \nany attempts to pay past due obligations which indicates he is not trying to resolve his \nindebtedness.  He did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances \nof his employment by at least attempting to pay some of his small debts.  His actions \nnot to pay debts were within his control.  His actions in not paying delinquent debts \n\n \n6 \n \n \nshows he has not acted responsibly in managing his finances (AG \u00b6 20(d)).  This shows \nhe will not act responsibly when handling of classified information.  The government \nestablished that Applicant's delinquent debts are a security concern.  The Applicant has \nthe burden to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern.  The information \npresented by Applicant is not sufficient to verify his claims and establish that he acted \nresponsibly towards his debts.  He has not mitigated security concerns raised by his \nfinancial situation. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning financial issues involving a judgment, a \nrepossession, a lien, and debts past due more than 180 days or 90 days raise a security \nconcern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \"the \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness.\" \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to answer financial questions \ncorrectly and accurately on his December 11, 2006 e-QIP security clearance \napplication, and his April 27, 2004 Public Trust Position application.  While there is a \nsecurity concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any \nwritten document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security \nclearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  \nA falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  Applicant admits he knowingly and willfully provide false financial information \non his security clearance application and public trust position application.  I find against \nApplicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken sufficient action to resolve his past due debts.  His \nindifferent attitude and lack of action show he is not trustworthy, responsible, or \nexercises good judgment.  Applicant has been irresponsible towards his delinquent \ndebts and financial obligations.  This is an indication that he might be irresponsible \ntowards the protection and handling of classified information.  He also deliberately \nprovided incomplete and false information on security clearance applications.  This \ncourse of conduct indicates he may not be truthful and careful in protecting classified \ninformation.  Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances \nand personal conduct.  Clearance is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.x:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nOn December 27, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On June 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under the guidelines for alcohol consumption and personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn July 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 8, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing twelve \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the \nFORM on September 28, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. On \nJanuary 8, 2010, DOHA assigned the case to me.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in the SOR. \nThose admissions are incorporated in the findings below.   \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He has four adult children from a former marriage. In \nJune 1978, he began working as a mechanic for a defense contractor. He was granted \na security clearance in December 1996. (Item 5; 10.) \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol abuse and treatment. He began \nconsuming alcohol at the age of 13, with regular use beginning at age 17. (Item 9 at \n132.)  In 1978, he was charged with Driving Under the Influence. On August 6, 2006, he \nsought inpatient treatment for alcohol abuse in order to maintain his employment. (Item \n5 at 50.) He stated that he was consuming 8 to 10 drinks of whiskey or beer a day. (Id.) \nAccording to a physician, he was discharged with a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependent on \nAugust 11, 2006.  \n \n \nSix months later, on January 7, 2008, Applicant was readmitted to the inpatient \ntreatment program and diagnosed as Alcohol Dependent, Nicotine Dependent, and \nAlcohol Withdrawal Syndrome by the medical director. He was consuming \u201cthree to four \ndrinks and six to eight beers\u201d on a daily basis. (Id. at 132.) His blood alcohol \nconcentration (BAC) was 0.279 on admission. He admitted that he smoked marijuana \nonce or twice a year, and last used it in June 2007. He also noted that he had a \nprevious history of using cocaine, with his last use of cocaine in 2002. (Id.) He was \ndischarged on January 19, 2008. In an April 2008 interview, he noted that after he \nsuccessfully completed treatment and returned to work, his employer gave him a \nreprimand and warned him that similar conduct should not happen again. He stated that \nhe continues to drink an occasional beer, but also stated that he did not intend to drink \nalcohol in the future. (Item 7 at 4.)      \n \n \nApplicant readmitted himself to an inpatient alcohol treatment program on June \n30, 2008, claiming he relapsed four to six weeks ago. His BAC was 0.287. During his \nadmission intake, he could not \u201cremember consuming more than one beer and \u20183-4\u2019 \ndrinks.\u2019\u201d (Id. at 222.) He stopped taking the medicine prescribed for him during the \nJanuary 2008 admission a week after he left the program. (Id.) He was discharged on \nJuly 27, 2008. He received a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependence and General Anxiety \nDisorder by a physician. (Id. at 250.) \n   \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nOn August 29, 2008, Applicant voluntarily entered the treatment facility for the \nfourth time with a BAC of 0.189. He stated that he \u201c\u2019Just started to get bad again & I \ndidn\u2019t want it to get as bad as it was.\u2019\u201d (Sic). A physician diagnosed him with Alcohol \nDependence, Nicotine Dependence, and Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome. (Item 9 at 339.) \nHe was discharged on September 1, 2008. In November 2008, he completed a set of \ninterrogatories. He indicated that he last consumed alcohol in August 2008 and did not \nintend to consume it in the future. (Item 6 at 2.) He did not submit any evidence \nregarding further participation in outpatient assistance programs or documentation of \nconsistent sobriety since then.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified his answers to three \nquestions in the e-QIP by failing to disclose certain information: (1) Section 23: Your \nPolice Record on the e-QIP: he did not disclose his 1978 alcohol offense; (2) Section \n24(a): Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity: he did not disclose that he used \nmarijuana up to 2007; and (3) Section 24(b): he did not disclose that he used cocaine \nand marijuana while holding a security clearance. In his Answer, he admitted all \nfalsification allegations.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d   \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n Analysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern, five of which \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \nIn 1978, Applicant received a DUI. In August 2006, he entered an inpatient \ntreatment program for alcohol abuse because his job was in jeopardy. Subsequently, he \nvoluntarily entered treatment in January 2008, June 2008, and August 2008. At the time \nof each admission, he had a high BAC and received a diagnosis of Alcohol Dependent \nfrom a physician in the treatment program. The evidence potentially raised all five of the \nabove disqualifications.  \nAfter the government raised a potential disqualifying condition, the burden shifted \nto Applicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns AG \u00b6 23 \nprovides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n None of the above mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a 30-year history of \nabusing alcohol, spanning from at least 1978 to August 2008. Given the frequency and \nlong history of alcohol abuse, his behavior casts doubt on his current trustworthiness \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. Although Applicant recognizes his \nalcoholism, he has not established a pattern of sustained rehabilitation and sobriety, \nwhich is necessary to apply AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant has a history of treatment and \nrelapses, eliminating the application of AG \u00b6 23(c). He did not provide any evidence to \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndemonstrate a sufficient pattern of abstinence or a favorable prognosis from a duly \nqualified professional. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe government alleged in \u00b6 2 of the SOR that Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to \ndisclose his 1978 DUI, drug abuse history, and use of illegal substances while holding a \nsecurity clearance in his e-QIP may raise disqualifications under AG \u00b6 15. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 sets out seven conditions that could raise security concerns and be \ndisqualifying. Two of them may be applicable in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, \nor other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information. \n \nApplicant admitted the three falsification allegations contained in the SOR. That \nadmission raised a potential disqualification under AG \u00b6 16(a). He also acknowledged \nthat he used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance, which is evidence of his \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations pertaining to the safeguarding of \nprotected information and raises a potential disqualification under AG \u00b6 16(c).  \nAG \u00b6 17 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n (g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to trigger the application of any \nmitigating condition listed under AG \u00b6 17.  He did not make an attempt to disclose the \ninformation prior to being interviewed about it, as required under AG \u00b6 17(a). His history \nof alcohol and illegal drug use is serious and not minor. It is relatively recent and long-\nstanding. His trustworthiness and judgment are in question. Hence, AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply. Although he acknowledged the problem, he has not documented a pattern of \nrehabilitation sufficient to alleviate the possibility of a recurrence. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not \napply. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 17(b) and AG \u00b6 \n17(e). Based on the evidence, AG \u00b6 17(f) and AG \u00b6 17(g) are irrelevant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 49-year-old divorced \nman and father of four adult children. He has abused alcohol most of his adult life (30 \nyears) and used illegal substances for a period of time up to 2007. While his candid \nadmissions of his history of alcohol abuse are noteworthy, he failed to document his \nintentions not to consume alcohol since August 2008. He did not provide any \nindependent evidence of consistent rehabilitative efforts since that time, or evidence \nthat he has gained significant insight or personal skills that will assure future alcohol \nabstinence or prevent illegal drug behavior. His long-term abuse of alcohol and \noccasional illegal drug use raise concerns about his reliability, judgment, and ability to \ncomply with rules and regulations. An equal security concern is Applicant\u2019s intentional \nfailure to divulge his drug use on the e-QIP application. He readily admitted that during \nhis first inpatient treatment program in 2006 he was concerned that his alcoholism \nwould affect his employment. The government imposes a special trust in one who holds \na security clearance and relies on a person to be honest and truthful regardless of the \nconsequences. His actions raise security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption and personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 2, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the security concerns under\n1\nGuidelines H and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, answered the allegations, and\nrequested a decision on the record. When the government amended the SOR on\nJanuary 22, 2009, Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. I\nAugust 18, 2009\n\nWhen the SOR was amended, the new allegations were framed in that order. This accounts\nfor the seeming illogical reference to 1.e above. \n2\nreceived the case assignment on June 2, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJune 11, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 9, 2009. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE 1-6), which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and presented Exhibits (AE A-D) which were admitted into\nthe record without objection. DOHA received the transcript on July 17, 2009. Based\nupon a review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel referenced the amended SOR at the hearing. The amended\nSOR added an allegation under Guideline H: \u00b6 1.e \u201cYou used both LSD and cocaine\napproximately 20 times each. You used these drugs up to approximately 1998.\u201d The\nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a was amended to add at the end of the allegation, \u201cand your LSD\nand cocaine use as set forth in subparagraph \u00b6 1.e above.\u201d  Finally, the amended SOR\n2\nadded \u00b6 2.c stating, \u201cYou falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application,\nexecuted by you on August 20, 2004, in response to question 27. Your Use of Illegal\nDrugs. You answered \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed marijuana use 10 times from 1997 to 2000.\nYou deliberately failed to disclose your marijuana use up to the execution of the\napplication as set forth in subparagraph \u00b6 1.a, and you deliberately failed to disclose\nyour LSD and cocaine use as set forth in subparagraph \u00b61.e above.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the original SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a through 1.d of the SOR. He also admitted the allegations in \u00b6 2.a through 2.b. In his\nAnswer to the amended SOR, Applicant denied the three new allegations.  \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1992 and obtained an undergraduate degree in 2004 (Tr. 25). He is\nsingle. Applicant has an eight-year-old son from a relationship for whom he has joint\ncustody (Tr. 61). He has worked in a professional capacity in the electrical engineering\nfield for his entire career. He has been with his current employer since 2002 (Tr. 55).\nApplicant used marijuana before attending high school. He estimates that his first\nuse was in the seventh grade in 1987 (Tr. 74). Applicant considered himself a heavy\nuser during high school and early college years until 1993 or 1994 (Tr. 75). He would\nreceive the marijuana from his friends (Tr. 80). On December 27, 1994, Applicant was\narrested and charged with possession of marijuana which he had in his car. On\nSeptember 28, 1995, the case was dismissed (deferred adjudication). Applicant was on\nprobation for one year (GE 5).\n\n3\nFrom 1995 until 2008, Applicant admits using marijuana perhaps 300 - 500\ntimes. He could not give an accurate number of times (Tr. 68). He acknowledged that\nhe was a \u201cregular user\u201d (Tr. 69). He admitted that he used marijuana while his son was\nat home (Tr. 82). Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR is inconsistent concerning the use of\nmarijuana. When he answered the SOR, Applicant included information about use of\ncocaine and LSD. He estimated that he used those drugs about 20 times each and the\nlast time was approximately ten years ago (Answer, dated December 22, 2008).\nApplicant completed his first security clearance application in July 2002. He\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to question 27 concerning use of illegal drugs and drug activity.\nHowever, he disclosed an arrest for marijuana that occurred in 1995 in response to\nquestion 26. He admitted that he falsified material facts on the 2002 SF 86 in his answer\nto the original SOR. He wrote that there was no excuse for either the falsification of the\nSF 86 or his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. He elaborated in that\nanswer that he did not list the drug use out of ignorance and fear. Applicant listed his\nillegal drug use for another employment application and he did not get the job. He\ndecided that he wanted this position and would list his marijuana use on the security\nclearance application after he won the job. He admitted that he did not list the other\ndrugs (LSD or cocaine) or the frequency out of fear (Answer, dated December 22,\n2008). \nApplicant completed another security clearance application in 2004. In response\nto question 27 concerning use of illegal drugs and drug activity, he responded \u201cyes\u201d and\ndisclosed use of marijuana. He listed the dates of use from January 1997 until August\n2000 (GE) 2. He responded \u201cno\u201d to question 28 concerning the illegal use of drugs while\nholding a security clearance (Tr. 82). \nApplicant held a top secret clearance in 2004 (Tr. 56). He also held access to\nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) for another agency until 2009. During that\ntime, Applicant admitted he used marijuana.\nOn February 25, 2008, Applicant failed a random drug test while working for his\nemployer. He tested positive for marijuana metabolites (GE 6). He held a security\nclearance at that time. Applicant was aware of the drug policy for the company. His\nemployer referred him to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) as a condition of\nemployment after the positive test result in 2008. Applicant was referred to a 12-week\npsycho-educational series based on the belief that his marijuana use was sporadic and\nrecreational (AE A). Applicant did not report any other substance use during the\nprogram. He completed the series in July 2008. During that time he submitted to\nunlimited random drug and alcohol screening. Applicant\u2019s expressed intent was to\nreplace marijuana with meditation (AE A).\nIn Applicant\u2019s December 2008, answer to the original SOR, he explained that he\nalso used LSD and cocaine during high school and/or college. He estimated the amount\nof use as much less than the marijuana use. He believed that perhaps he used each\n\n4\ndrug approximately 20 times. He could not remember the exact dates. He concluded in\nthat answer that the \u201cmajority of the times I used these drugs were prior to 1995.\u201d\nApplicant summarized in that original answer to the SOR that he was an honest\nperson by nature but when he filled out the forms he felt \u201creally stigmatized\u201d and did not\nknow that he should just list everything and let the decision be made. He referred to his\nexpertise in the workplace. He also emphasized that he did not need rehabilitation and\nwas not referred for further treatment after the EAP program. Applicant cites his\ninvolvement with his son as evidence of reliability and trustworthiness. He would do\nanything that is now required to retain a security clearance (Answer, dated December\n22, 2008).\nIn that same answer, Applicant wrote that if you knew him you would not\nquestion his character or abilities. He knew that his employer has confidence in his\nwork. He stressed that the company retained him despite the 2008 positive test result.\nApplicant expressed his love of his work. He also noted his community involvement with\nhis son\u2019s sports. He understood that the drug use was wrong. He explained that he was\nlonely after his relationship ended and if he used marijuana he could put things in\nperspective (Answer, dated December 22, 2008). \n  \nIn May 2008, Applicant was interviewed by the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM) investigator (GE 4). He admitted a history of marijuana use during his\nemployment for the research institute since 2002. He told the investigator that he\nagreed to a policy of random drug testing as a condition for employment. However, he\ncontinued to use marijuana for relaxation during the more than six years of employment.\nHe used a pipe when he smoked. He acknowledged purchasing the marijuana from an\nassociate. He elaborated that when he spoke to the psychologist with the EAP program,\nhe reported no problem with illegal drug use and that he only used marijuana to relax.\nHe stated he was never addicted to marijuana. The admission concerning the number\nand frequency of use is different than the admission in Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR\nand at the hearing (Tr. 42).\nIn response to the amended SOR, Applicant denied that he used both LSD and\ncocaine approximately 20 times until approximately 1998. He also denied that he\nfalsified his 2004 security clearance application. He explained that it would be\nimpossible to remember the exact dates he used cocaine or LSD. He stated that he\ndenied a falsification on the 2004 application because the use of cocaine and LSD was\nout of the seven-year time period (Tr. 44).\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that he never told his employer that he\nregularly used marijuana prior to the positive test result in 2008 (Tr. 108). He also\nadmitted that he used cocaine and LSD (Tr. 109). He believed that he used cocaine in\nhigh school but was not sure if that was the last time (Tr. 110). He did not recall how\nmany times he used cocaine. He used LSD in high school and believed the last time\nwas in 1996 (Tr. 113). He was adamant that this use was not relevant to his honesty or\ntrustworthiness. He also was firm that he was not trying to hide anything. He stated that\n\n5\nbreaking the law does not necessarily reflect on a person\u2019s trustworthiness (Tr. 148). In\nresponse to a question from Department Counsel, Applicant noted that he did not tell\nthe psychologist about the cocaine and LSD use because he did not ask. He believed\nhe told someone else in the program about the cocaine use (Tr. 114).\nApplicant\u2019s employer recommended that Applicant retain his security clearance.\nHe applauded his dedication, ability and technical accomplishments (AE B). His\nsupervisor since 2004 describes Applicant as an exceptional worker who consistently\ncompletes projects quickly and accurately. His work is accurate, excellent and\ncomprehensive (AE C). Applicant is a good engineer. He has a calm demeanor and his\nfocus on work is consistent with one who manages his time well (AE D). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n6\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(b) \u201ctesting\npositive for illegal drug use\u201d is disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying. Applicant admitted\nhis use of marijuana in varying amounts and frequency spanning a period from about\n1995 until February 2008. In 1995, he was charged with possession of marijuana. He\nalso admitted using cocaine and LSD approximately 20 times each. He failed a random\ndrug test in February 2008. These disqualifying conditions apply in this case.\nUnder AG \u00b6 25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d\nis a disqualifying condition. Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance.\nHe used marijuana during the entire time that he was employed from 2002 until 2008.\nHis use of marijuana while holding a security clearance was not an isolated event but a\npattern of behavior. He tested positive for marijuana in February 2008. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\npattern of illegal drug use (marijuana or cocaine) continued from a young age to adult\n\n7\nmaturity. He was a mature adult working for a company and violating the drug policy\nwhen he continued to use illegal drugs. He did not stop using marijuana prior to the\nFebruary 2008 positive test. This shows poor judgment and lack of trustworthiness\ngiven the fact that he had a security clearance during that time. I do not find that this\nmitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where there is Aa demonstrated intent not\nto abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase for the reasons discussed above.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 16(a) a disqualifying condition exists when there is \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 16(b) a disqualifying condition exists when \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d\nApplicant executed several security clearance applications from 2002 until 2008. He\nadmitted that he falsified information concerning his illegal drug use out of fear and\nignorance. He wanted to gain a position and feared that he would not if he was truthful\nabout his drug use. He knew that he used LSD and cocaine and did not list either drug\non his 2004 security clearance application. Applicant failed to disclose illegal drug use\nwhile holding a security clearance for many years. His behavior and personal conduct\nare disqualifying as they raise questions about his judgment, reliability, and  willingness\nto comply with the law. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that they are not\nsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. He served in a professional capacity for his entire career. He has held\nsecret and top secret security clearances. He used marijuana during his time with his\ncurrent employer. He never felt there was a problem. He failed a drug test at work and\ndid not disclose the full extent of his drug use. He attended the EAP program and\nbelieves that since he was allowed to remain with his employer, despite the drug test in\n2008, that he has proved his reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant completed three security clearance applications during his years of\ncontract service. He deliberately omitted information concerning his illegal drug use on\nmore than one occasion. He made no attempt to correct his falsifications prior to being\nconfronted. He does not equate his protracted marijuana use, despite his employer\u2019s\ndrug policy, with untrustworthiness, dishonesty or poor judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR, but she denied that her debt was a security concern. She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. 1 Applicant, who is 36 years old, works as a planner for a Department of Defense contractor. She began her employment with this company in September 2007. When she accepted her current position, she moved 1500 miles from home.2 Applicant attended college for two years. Since college, she has worked as a production planner or a buyer planner. She is single, but lives with a significant other. When she completed her security clearance application, she listed two debts which were past due: a bank credit card in the amount of $12,000 and a store credit card in the amount of $6,000.3 By May 2007, after deciding she needed to resolve these two debts, she retained the services of a credit counseling agency. Under the terms of her agreement with the credit counseling agency, Applicant paid a specific sum each month to the credit counseling agency. The credit counseling agency then placed the funds in an account and made monthly settlement offers to her creditors. She began making monthly payments of an unknown amount to the credit counseling agency in May 2007.

On September 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 26, 2009\n\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR).\n1\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application (e-QIP)) at 2, 7.\n2\nId. at 6-11, 13, 16, 22-23.\n3\nItem 5 (Interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s response with attachments) at 3, 5-11; Item  6 (Credit report, dated\n4\nMarch 27, 2008).\n2\nApplicant received the SOR. She submitted a notarized, written response to the\nSOR allegations on October11, 2008, and requested a decision on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on November 3, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nNovember 6, 2008. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not submit a response\nor additional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on January 21, 2008. The\ngovernment submitted eight exhibits, including Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, which\nhave been marked as Items 1-8 and admitted into the record.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR, but she denied that her debt was a security concern.\nShe also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 36 years old, works as a planner for a Department of Defense\ncontractor. She began her employment with this company in September 2007. When\nshe accepted her current position, she moved 1500 miles from home.2\nApplicant attended college for two years. Since college, she has worked as a\nproduction planner or a buyer planner. She is single, but lives with a significant other.\nWhen she completed her security clearance application, she listed two debts which\nwere past due: a bank credit card in the amount of $12,000 and a store credit card in\nthe amount of $6,000.3\nBy May 2007, after deciding she needed to resolve these two debts, she retained\nthe services of a credit counseling agency. Under the terms of her agreement with the\ncredit counseling agency, Applicant paid a specific sum each month to the credit\ncounseling agency. The credit counseling agency then placed the funds in an account\nand made monthly settlement offers to her creditors. She began making monthly\npayments of an unknown amount to the credit counseling agency in May 2007. In\nDecember 2007, she authorized the credit counseling agency to withdraw $400 a month\nfrom her checking account, starting January 31, 2008. She has not provided any\ndocumentation which indicates that the $400 is actually being paid.  \n4\n\nItem 7 (Credit report, dated August 12, 2008) at 1; Item 8 (Credit report, dated August 12, 2008) at 3. In its\n5\nbrief, the government acknowledges that the store credit card debt was paid through the credit counseling\nagency as shown on these credit reports. Brief at 3.\nItem 1 (SOR)\n6\nItem 6, supra note 4; Item 7, supra note 5; Item 8, supra note 5.\n7\nItem 5, supra note 4, at 5, 7.\n8\n3\nApplicant\u2019s monthly payments to the credit counseling agency resulted in the\npayment of her store credit card listed on her security clearance application. The credit\nreport dated August 12, 2008 reflects that Applicant resolved the store credit card debt,\nwhich had increased to $8,432.5\nThe bank debt Applicant identified in her security clearance application remains\nunpaid and is the basis for the SOR. Applicant has provided information which indicates\nthat the credit counseling agency has made regular monthly settlement offers to the\nbank. The documentation shows different monthly offer amounts to the bank by the\ncredit agency from May 2007 through August 2008 totaling $7,502. The documents do\nnot show a cumulative offer amount, acceptance of any of the monthly offer amounts by\nthe bank, and how much money Applicant has paid to the credit counseling agency.  \n6\nThe credit reports of record indicate that Applicant timely pays or has paid many\ndebts. The two debts discussed above are the only two outstanding debts listed on\nthese reports.7\nApplicant\u2019s gross salary is $4,100 a month and her net pay is $3,081 a month.\nHer monthly expenses total $2,542 a month and include the $400 a month payment to\nthe credit counseling agency.  \n8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n9\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], the Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of \u201cthe administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008).\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n9\n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated two large delinquent debts, one of which is\npaid. The other debt remains unpaid. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s one\nremaining large debt is recent and unpaid. This potentially mitigating condition does not\napply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\n\nThe mitigating conditions in \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) do not apply in this case.\n10\n6\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has not\npresented any evidence which indicates that her financial problems arose because of\nconditions beyond her control. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ In May 2007, several months before she began her current\nposition, Applicant retained the services of a credit counseling agency to help her\nresolve her store credit card and bank credit card debts. She began making a monthly\npayment to this agency in May 2007, which she anticipated would be used to pay each\nof her debts. In turn, the agency began making monthly settlement offers to each of her\ncreditors, which it characterizes as negotiations. While the negotiation and offer\npractices of the agency are not clearly explained, the credit counseling agency resolved\nher store credit card debt through settlement. In December 2007, Applicant authorized\nthe credit counseling agency to withdraw $400 a month from her checking account,\nbeginning in January 2008, to be used to resolve her debts. Although the record does\nnot contain documented evidence that this money has been withdrawn, Applicant lists\nthe payment as part of her monthly expenses. In addition, because the store credit card\ndebt has been resolved with the assistance of this credit counseling agency, I infer that\nthe $400 monthly payment is being held by the credit counseling agency until a\nresolution can be reached with the creditor for the bank credit card debt. I also find that\nApplicant\u2019s payments to the credit counseling agency constitute a good faith effort to\nresolve her one remaining debt because she is relying on the credit counseling agency\nto help her repay this debt through a settlement resolution. Thus, I conclude these\npotentially mitigating conditions apply.10\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, as well as all the evidence of record, in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. In early 2007, Applicant recognized that she\nneeded to resolve two large outstanding debts. She retained a credit counseling agency\nto help her, and by May 2007, she had begun payments to the credit counseling\nagency. She made this decision months before she started her current position and\nnearly a year before she completed her security clearance application. \nWith the help of the credit counseling agency, Applicant reached a settlement\nagreement with creditor for the store credit card debt of more than $8,000 and paid the\ndebt. She continues to pay the credit counseling agency, which continues to make\nsettlement offers to the holder of the bank credit card debt. Although this debt is not\npaid, Applicant is not required to pay her old debts in full to hold a security clearance.\nShe must make an effort to resolve her outstanding debts. In this case, Applicant has\nworked towards her debt resolution for nearly two years. She continues to work through\nthe credit counseling agency to pay the bank credit card debt. Given that this debt is\nclose to $15,000, it will take time for her to accumulate sufficient funds to pay the debt.\nHer decision to pay the credit counseling agency $400 a month shows her\ndetermination to pay this debt. \nApplicant pays her other bills in a timely manner and has regularly done so. She\nlives within her financial means, not above her income level. Significantly, she has taken\naffirmative action to pay or resolve her two largest, delinquent debts. Of course, the\nissue is not simply whether all her debts are paid: it is whether her financial\ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. While her\nbank card debt is unpaid, the unpaid status is insufficient to raise a security concern\nbecause she is making a good faith effort to pay this debt through the credit counseling\nagency. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) Having weighed her efforts and assumption of\nresponsibility for her old debts against the fact that the credit reports do not show the\nbank credit card debt paid in full, I find that Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns about her finances.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On December 17, 2008, The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H for drug involvement.  The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 7, 2009, and answered \nthe allegations in writing on January 12, 2009.  He admitted both allegations under \nGuidelines H with explanation, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 28, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on February 23, 2009.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February \n24, 2009, for a hearing on March 18, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The \ngovernment offered three exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-3 which \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nwere received without objection.  Applicant submitted two exhibits marked Applicant \nExhibits (App. Ex.) A and B, which were received without objection.  Applicant and two \nwitnesses testified on Applicant's behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on March 26, 2009.  Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation.  He also provided additional information to support his request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old unmarried engineer working as a computer electronic \ndesigner for a defense contractor.  He started working as a co-op student for the \ndefense contractor when he was 17 years old and in high school (See Gov. Ex. 2, \nSecurity Clearance Application, dated April 30, 2003).  He continued in the position \nthrough college and started working full time for the defense contractor in March 2008, \nshortly after graduating from college in December 2007 with an engineering degree.  \nApplicant received his first security clearance in 2003 when he was just turning 18 years \nold, entering college, and working as a college level co-op student (Tr. 13-14, 26-31; \nGov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated May 7, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application for a periodic update of his \nsecurity clearance on May 7, 2008 (Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated May 7, 2008).  In response \nto questions 24A and 24B concerning use of illegal drugs, Applicant answered \"YES\" to \nusing illegal drugs and using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance.  In the \nremarks section under question 24, Applicant noted he used marijuana twice, once in \nJanuary 2007 and again in December 2007.  In response to Interrogatories, Applicant \nstated he took one to three hits of marijuana each time.  He stated his last use of \nmarijuana was in December 2007 (Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, dated \nSeptember 8, 2008).   \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed on June 19, 2008, by a security investigator \nconcerning his use of marijuana.  In a summary of his responses to the security agent \nattached to his Answer to the Interrogatories, Applicant stated he used marijuana with \neither his older brother or friends on both occasions.  He stated his use was \nexperimental out of curiosity.  He felt no effect from the drug, and the marijuana tasted \nbad and made him cough.  He stopped using marijuana after the December 2007 use \nbecause he did not plan to make it a habit to use marijuana and he did not feel the need \nto use the drug.  He did not purchase the drug either time since the marijuana was \noffered to him in a social setting (Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, dated \nSeptember 8, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant testified that his older brother used drugs when they were growing up \nand it caused a problem in the family.  This gave him a motivation not to use drugs.  His \nfirst use of marijuana was in January 2007 with friends while playing video games.  He \n\n \n3 \n \ntook a few hits from a device that was passed to him.  He wanted to be polite to his \nfriends while in this social setting.  He believed it would be rude not to participate.  His \nfriends knew where he worked but not that he held a security clearance.  At the time, he \nwas 22 years old.  His friends were about the same age.  While he was free to decide at \nthe time if he wanted to use the drug, he did not think about the consequences of drug \nuse (Tr. 15-16, 31-33, 41-44). \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana again in December 2007 at a party at his brother's \nhouse to celebrate Applicant's graduation from college.  He again took two or three hits \nof marijuana from a device to be polite.  There were six to eight friends present and they \nwere drinking beer and using a vaporizer to inhale marijuana.  They were having a party \nand everyone was using the marijuana.  He was with friends and family that he trusted \nand respected so he used the marijuana (Tr. 15-20, 35-36).   \n \n \nApplicant stated it has been his practice since high school to leave an area \nwhere drugs are used.  He told people that he does not want to be involved in illegal \ndrug use.  He admitted going against his own policy when he used marijuana in January \nand December 2007.  He also admitted that his facility security officer impressed upon \nhim when he first applied for a security clearance in 2003 that he should not use illegal \ndrugs while holding a security clearance.  At that time, he was against drug use.  He \ntook her advice seriously, but he did not think about it when he used marijuana in 2007.  \nIn 2007, he was just completing college and he made a mistake by using marijuana (Tr. \n44-47).   \n \n \nApplicant stated that he has changed his social habits since 2007.  He does not \nnow normally associate with friends who use drugs.  He does see his brother but does \nnot know if he still uses drugs since he does not use drugs around him.  If he sees his \nfriends now, they are in public and not at someone's house where it is easy to use \nillegal drugs.  He is now working full time and has obligations to help his father who is \nretired and needs his support.  He does not have close friends who use illegal drugs.  \nHe spends his time in athletics, like martial arts and swimming.  He took a drug test in \nFebruary 2009 on the advice of his attorney which was negative for drugs (App. Ex. B, \nTest results, dated February 11, 2009).  He completed an affidavit that he consents to \ntesting for drug use and acknowledges that if he uses illegal drugs in the future, he \nwould lose his access to classified information (App. Ex. A, Affidavit, dated February 11, \n2009).  Applicant stated his only use of illegal drugs was in January and December \n2007, and his last use of illegal drugs was in December 2007.  He stated his intention \nnot to use illegal drugs in the future because he no longer has friends that use illegal \ndrugs and he realizes the consequences of illegal drug use for himself and his job (Tr. \n21-26, 39-42, 46-50). \n \n \nApplicant's immediate supervisor testified that he hired Applicant as a co-op \nstudent while Applicant was in high school.  Applicant has worked for him for about \neight years.  He has known Applicant for over 15 years and watched him grow up.   He \nhired Applicant out of high school because he knew of his talents and his good attitude \ntowards work.  Applicant is very dependable and seeks work.  He is a valuable core \nmember of his team and is dependable with good work ethics.  Applicant has always \n\n \n4 \n \nadhered to the physical security rules at work for handling classified information.  \nApplicant socializes with him and his family and others from work.  Applicant conducts \nhimself very appropriately.  He has never seen Applicant in any inappropriate behavior.  \nHe was shocked to learn of Applicant's use of illegal drugs on two occasions.  He \nbelieves Applicant made a mistake and it does not alter his opinion of Applicant.  He is \ndisappointed in Applicant for making such an unfortunate mistake.  His company does \nnot have a formal drug policy except that it is known that employees should not use \nillegal drugs because of their access to classified information (Tr. 53-65). \n \n \nA fellow worker who has known Applicant for over five years testified he sees \nApplicant on a daily basis and works close to him.  Applicant is pleasant at work, arrives \non time, and is rarely absent from work.  Applicant does a fantastic job and is the office \ngo-to person to solve problems.  Applicant always follows the rules concerning access \nto classified information.  Applicant relates well to others at work.  He was surprised to \nlearn that Applicant used marijuana on two occasions.  However, he is not surprised \nApplicant admitted the use since he is a very honest person.  Applicant's use of \nmarijuana does not alter his opinion of him, and he does not believe it will hinder \nApplicant's handling of classified information.  The witness and his family and other \nfellow employees socialize with Applicant outside of work.  None of the group uses \nillegal drugs.  He believes the company drug policy follows the federal guidelines in that \nthey cannot use illegal drugs (Tr. 65-74).   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair \njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Drugs are mood and behavior altering \nsubstances, and include those listed on the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  \nMarijuana is listed as a controlled substance drug under the Controlled Substance Act \nof 1970.  Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction (AG \u00b6 24). \n \nThe information in the exhibits presented at the hearing by the government and \nApplicant's answers and testimony are sufficient to raise Drug Involvement Disqualifying \nConditions (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) \"any drug use\", DI DC AG \u00b6 25(c) \"illegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution\", and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(g) \"any illegal drug use after being granted a security \nclearance\".  It is clear from Applicant's own statement that he used marijuana in \nJanuary and December 2007.  He had to possess the marijuana to use it.  He has held \na security clearance since 2003, so he used marijuana while holding a security \nclearance.  Even though his drug use was experimental, it raises a security clearance \nconcern. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and (g), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate his use of illegal drug (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15).  An applicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.   \n \n \nI considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) \u00b6 26(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; and DI MC \u00b6 26(b) \"a \ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where \ndrugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\".  Applicant used \nmarijuana twice in 2007 with his last use in December 2007, about fifteen months \nbefore the hearing.  At the time of his use of the illegal drug, Applicant was twenty-two \nyears old and a college student who was socializing with his brother and other friends.  \nHe used marijuana on these occasions mainly out of curiosity. His use of marijuana was \ninfrequent in that he only used it twice about twelve months apart.  Applicant used \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance which he received when he was about \neighteen years old.  He has now graduated from college, is steadily employed, and has \nchanged his social habits and his friends.  His supervisor and fellow worker attest to his \ngood work performance and ethics and his reputation for honesty and integrity.   \n \n \nApplicant stated his intention not to use illegal drugs in the future. He stated he \nno longer goes to places where drugs are used and rarely associates with people that \nuse drugs.  He submitted to a drug test just prior to the hearing which indicates that he \nwas drug free at the time of the test and a further indication that he is not now using \nillegal drugs.  He executed an affidavit that he will not use illegal drugs in the future and \nthat he would automatically lose his access to classified information if he did use illegal \ndrugs.   \n \n \n \nApplicant reported that he used marijuana on two occasions on his security \nclearance application.  Except for Applicant's admission on the application, it is doubtful \nthat his marijuana use would be known to his company or security officials.  While he \nwas required to list his use of marijuana on his security clearance application because \nof the requirement to answer all questions truthfully, the fact that he did list his \nmarijuana use is some indication of his honesty and truthfulness.  He testified at the \nhearing openly and candidly providing detailed responses to questions.  His testimony \nthat he only used marijuana on two occasions in 2007 and has not used marijuana \nsince December 2007 is credible.  His intention not to use marijuana in the future is also \nunderstandable and credible.  His testimony is sufficient information to establish he no \nlonger uses illegal drugs.  While the time since his last use of marijuana is only fifteen \nmonths, under the circumstances of his age at the time of use, his status as a college \nstudent, a recent negative drug test, and the execution of a document of automatic \nrevocation for using illegal drugs, sufficient time has passed since his last use of illegal \ndrugs to indicate he no longer uses illegal drugs.  Applicant met his heavy burden of \n\n \n7 \n \nestablishing that his past drug use does not now raise questions concerning his \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations.  \nI find for Applicant as to drug involvement under Guideline H. \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that Applicant has \nbeen employed by the same defense contractor since he was a high school student, \nthat his employment record is good, and that he is held in high esteem by this \nsupervisor and fellow worker.  I considered that he was only twenty-two years old and a \ncollege student when he used marijuana and that he has now matured and understands \nthe consequences of his action in using illegal drugs.  He has changed his social habits \nand the people he socializes with to avoid situations where drugs are used.  I \nconsidered that he recently tested negative for drug use, and he signed a document that \nif he used illegal drugs in the future he would automatically lose his security clearance.  \nOverall on balance, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines J and G. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nIn an undated answer Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on June 1, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 24, 2009.

Applicant did not object and they were \nadmitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since January \n2008. Prior to 2008 he was on active duty in the military for ten years before being \ndischarged with a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions due to alcohol \nrehabilitation failure. He is married and has two children ages, 16 and 9 years old.1  \n \n \nIn August 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery of a \nfamily member. He stated his wife assaulted him and he pushed her and she sustained \na bruise. He was in the military at the time and was ordered to attend the Family \nAdvocacy Program. He received counseling and completed the program. He was \nconvicted of a misdemeanor, sentenced to two years of probation and 30 days \nconfinement which was suspended.2  \n \n \nOn February 28, 2004, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI). He was speeding at the time he was stopped by the police. He had been \nat a party. He took a breathalyzer test and recorded a Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) of \n.19%. He pled guilty to the offense. He was sentenced to one year in jail and all but one \nday was suspended. He also paid a $1,000 fine and his driver\u2019s license was restricted.3  \n \nAfter this DUI, Applicant attended an alcohol awareness program and completed \na 30-day residential alcohol treatment program through the military. The program \nconsisted of assignment to an addictions group for participation in a structured program \ncomprised of group counseling (40 hours), education and therapeutic workshops (40 \nhours), physical training, relapse prevention workshop (20 hours), and attendance at \n12-step meetings. He was diagnosed with \u201calcohol abuse rule out dependency.\u201d4 He \nfound it educational, but admitted he was not serious about it.5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on about November 25, 2006, and charged with DUI. He \nadmitted he had been drinking alcohol at a friend\u2019s house. He was sentenced to six \n \n1 Tr. 43, 55-56; GE 3. \n \n2 Tr. 56-58. \n \n3 Tr. 39-41, 58-60. \n \n4 AE C. \n \n5 Tr. 41-43. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nmonths in jail; five months and 10 days were suspended. He served 20 days in jail. His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for three years. He was also ordered to attend an \nalcohol awareness program, which he did. He paid a $500 fine.6  \n \n \nApplicant also went to nonjudicial punishment in September 2007, under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice, for the DUI offense of November 25, 2006, and \nbecause he was in an unauthorized leave status for two days. He did not tell his \ncommand that he had been arrested for DUI, his second offense. He was also charged \nwith failing to follow orders to not drink and drive and with making a false official \nstatement related to the DUI. Applicant admitted that when he was in jail he did not want \nhis military command to know of his DUI arrest. He stated that he told his command that \nhe had not been arrested for DUI. He admitted he tried to hide the charges from his \ncommand. It was not until he had to go to court on the DUI charge in August 2007, \napproximately nine months later, that the command became aware of the actual \npending charges. Applicant attended a 40-hour military alcohol rehabilitation relapse \nprogram from October 1, 2007 to October 5, 2007. After the nonjudicial punishment \nhearing, Applicant was administratively discharged from the military in November 2007.7  \n \n \nOn March 2, 2008, Applicant signed his security clearance application. On \nSeptember 16, 2008, Applicant provided sworn responses to Interrogatories. He stated \nin his Interrogatories regarding his prior two DUI convictions the following: \u201cI have truly \nlearned from these mistakes.\u201d He also indicated that he continued to consume alcohol.8 \n \n \nOn September 29, 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, 3rd \noffense within 5 years, a felony; driving with a revoked license; driving without license, a \nfelony; 3rd DWI: refusal of blood or breath test, 3rd offense; and accident: driver did not \nreport, property damage greater than $250. Adjudication of this case is still pending. \nApplicant admitted he was arrested and charged, but denies he committed the offenses. \nHe stated a friend came to his house and because Applicant had a restricted license, \nthe friend drove Applicant\u2019s car to a bar and Applicant was a passenger. Applicant \nadmitted he drank alcohol at the bar, but stated his friend was not drinking alcohol. \nWhen they left the bar the friend who was driving had an accident on the way home and \nhit a pole. He stated his friend jumped out of the vehicle and ran away. Applicant \npanicked because of his prior convictions and left the accident scene and walked home. \nHe was arrested later at his home. He refused to provide a blood sample. He cannot \nfind his friend to corroborate his story. His friend\u2019s phone is disconnected. He stated he \nmet his friend playing basketball at the YMCA. He does not know his friend\u2019s last name. \nHe knew him only for a couple of months. He has tried to find his friend but has been \n \n6 Tr. 60-62. \n \n7 Tr. 49, 60-71. \n \n8 Tr. 45-46; GE 4 pages 2 and 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nunsuccessful. Applicant did not provide any other witnesses to corroborate any part of \nhis story.9 \n \nA licensed clinical social worker met with Applicant on October 23, 2008, and \nprovided the following: \n \nI see no indication of alcohol dependence. The medical diagnosis on his \nchart at this time is alcohol abuse 305.00, not alcohol dependence 303.90.  \n \nPrior to meeting with me, [Applicant] participated in two inpatient \nsubstance abuse treatment programs. It appears he completed each of \nthese programs completely and successfully. I have reviewed [Applicant\u2019s] \nhistory and documents and feel that there is no indication of alcohol \ndependency at this time.10  \n \n \nApplicant admits he has a history of alcohol abuse. He stated that \u201calcohol is bad \nfor me.\u201d He admitted he cannot drink alcohol because it affects his judgment and his \nlife. He stated alcohol destroyed his military career. He knows he has a track record of \nalcohol abuse and he is working on it and doing his best. After his last DUI arrest he \nstated he has abstained from alcohol consumption. He enrolled in an alcohol recovery \nprogram and attended sessions on June 11, 2009 and June 18, 2009.11  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n \n9 Tr. 24-30, 50-54. \n \n10 Tr. 46-49; GE 5. \n \n11 Tr. 29-39, 48-49, 72-75; AE A and B. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern relating to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of DUI twice. His charges of felony DUI, leaving the \nscene of an accident, failure to report an accident and property damage, and driving \nwithout a license are pending adjudication. He was also found guilty at nonjudicial \npunishment for providing false statements to his command about his DUI arrest. There \nis sufficient evidence to raise both disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 23 and especially considered the following: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has two convictions for DUI since 2004. Days before he was arrested a \nthird time for DUI, he stated in his Interrogatories that he had learned his lesson. \nApplicant continues to use poor judgment when using alcohol. His latest felony charges \nare still pending. Although Applicant disputes he was the driver of the car at the last \nincident, he failed to provide any corroborating evidence. It appears thatApplicant \ncontinues to make the same poor choices that cost him his military career. Not until very \nrecently has he altered his alcohol consumption, and this did not occur until after his 3rd \nDUI arrest. I find, under the circumstances, that none of the above mitigating conditions \napply.  \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including:  \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant has three DUI arrests, two resulting in convictions, and he is pending \nadjudication on a third DUI arrest, a felony. He continued to consume alcohol after his \nfirst two convictions. He was diagnosed by a licensed clinical social worker as an \nalcohol abuser. He completed alcohol counseling and inpatient treatment, but continued \nto use poor judgment when consuming alcohol when he was arrested for his third DUI \nand leaving the scene of an accident. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions \napply. \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 and \nespecially considered: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant had three alcohol-related incidents since 2004. He attended alcohol \nawareness and education and also completed inpatient alcohol counseling. Days before \nhis third DUI arrest, he stated he had learned his lesson from his mistakes. He \ncontinued to consume alcohol after the first two DUI convictions. At his hearing he \nstated that he stopped drinking after his last arrest. He only recently acknowledged he \n\n \n8 \n \n \nuses poor judgment when he consumes alcohol. He has an extended history of alcohol \nhaving a negative impact on his life, including being discharged from the military \nbecause of alcohol rehabilitation failure. Applicant lied to his command about his DUI \narrest. He states that he was not driving when he was arrested for the third DUI, but did \nnot have evidence to corroborate any part of his story. I cannot find at this juncture that \nApplicant has overcome his problem with alcohol. He has attended only two alcohol \ncounseling sessions in the past couple of weeks. He failed to take heed of his previous \ncounseling sessions and it is too early to determine if this time will be different. \nApplicant has had three warnings about the negative impact alcohol has on his \njudgment before his last arrest. He was arrested and went to jail twice for DUI. He was \ndischarged from the Navy due to his alcohol issues. Although he claims he now \nunderstands his alcohol issues, it is too early to determine if his commitment can be \nsustained. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military until \nhis career was cut short due to incidents involving alcohol. He has been afforded \nalcohol awareness and education courses. He continued to make poor decisions when \nusing alcohol. He has felony DUI charges pending. Applicant has abstained from \ndrinking alcohol since his last arrest and is attending counseling. He has repeatedly \nbeen given opportunities to make the right decision regarding his conduct when \nconsuming alcohol and has failed. Applicant does not yet have a sufficient track record \nto conclude that alcohol is no longer a factor in his choices and decisions. He has failed \nto meet his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   2.d-2.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2008, and was scheduled for\nhearing on February 23, 2008.  A hearing was held on February 23, 2008, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of six exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nMarch 13, 2009\n\n2\nand three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on March 3, 2009.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file,. pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is denied.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to renumber\nsubparagraph 1.h (the second one) as subparagraph 1.j to conform to the alphabet.\nThere being no objection from Applicant, and for good cause shown, Department\ncounsel\u2019s motion was granted. The correction was made by inter-lineation. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in June 2008, (b) had a judgment entered against him in January 2008 in\nthe amount of $89,364.00, and (c) accumulated nine debts exceeding $1 million. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, but\ndenied any debts owed to creditors 1.h, 1.j, and denied any adverse judgment entered\nagainst him by creditor 1.b.  He claimed all of the debts were included in his bankruptcy\npetition and discharge. He explained that he was the co-signor for the listed\nautomobiles in the SOR, which were financed for his business and were eventually\nrepossessed.  He claimed the listed credit card debt with creditor 1.f was business-\nrelated.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old manufacturing engineer for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant received an engineering degree from a local college in 1990 (see ex.\n1).  He worked in the technical field between 1990 and 2002 (ex. 1).  In 2002, he\nopened a real estate brokerage franchise in his local area (ex. 1).  By reported\naccounts, the franchise was chartered by a national real estate parent firm.  Applicant\ndoes not provide any information, though, on the form of the franchise (corporate,\npartnership, or sole proprietorship), or amount of capital he and his partners (if any)\ncommitted to the franchise.  No information is furnished either concerning his\nfranchise\u2019s revenues and expenses during the pre-2007 years of well publicized\nappreciation and growth in his region\u2019s real estate industry. \nBetween January 2002 and June 2007, Applicant operated his real estate\nbrokerage franchise (see ex. 1).  Presumably, the franchise was operated as a\nproprietorship or partnership, absent any documentation of its incorporation.  Applicant\nand his franchise apparently paid annual franchise fees to the parent organization for\n\n3\nthe privilege of using the parent\u2019s name and utilizing its marketing facilities.  As his\nfranchise\u2019s chief financial officer, he was required to co-sign for leased vehicles\nfinanced for the use and benefit of his franchise\u2019s brokers and business officials (R.T.,\nat ).  He also took out a credit card in his name for business-related purposes.  \nWhen the real estate market in his region began to turn negative in 2006,\nApplicant\u2019s franchise fell behind with its annual franchise fees.  In June 2006, the parent\nfiled suit against Applicant and his franchise in the alleged sum of $2,,000,000.00 (see\nexs. 3 and B; R.T., at 33).  As the real estate market continued to deteriorate in 2007,\nApplicant and his franchise got behind with their lease payments for the company\nvehicles, their credit card accounts, and their building rent.  By April 2007, Applicant and\nhis company franchise had defaulted on their lease, credit card obligations, and rent.\nAfter trying unsuccessfully to work out payment arrangements with his creditors,\nApplicant and his company closed the franchise in April 2007 (R.T., at 35-36,78).\nActing on the advice of his counsel, he petitioned for bankruptcy of his franchise in June\n2007 (R.T., at 32-33).  Disposition of his franchise\u2019s bankruptcy petition is unclear.\nBased on the presented proofs, neither Applicant nor his franchise made any\nconcerted efforts to try and cure their default with the franchise parent and their other\ncreditors after they closed their franchise offices.  Between July 2007 and January\n2008, the vehicle lenders/lessees repossessed the four company vehicles and held\nApplicant (as a personal co-signor) and his franchise liable for the deficiency balances\non these repossessed cars (i.e., creditors 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g) following their public sales\n(see exs. 3 through 5; R.T., at 41-53).  The remaining balance on the repossession\nundertaken by creditor 1.k was waived as part of an approved short sale (R.T., at 67-\n69). The franchise\u2019s building lessor, in turn, sued Applicant and his franchise in 2007 for\n$89,364.00 (creditor 1.b) in owed commercial rent and obtained a default against\nApplicant, and unspecified judgment.  Applicant\u2019s credit card account (creditor 1.f) was\nplaced in collection status.  \nWith no income to cover his personal mortgage after closing his real estate\nfranchise (in April 2007), Applicant was unable to cover any of the defaulted mortgage\npayments on his mortgages (creditors 1.h and 1.j).  Creditor 1.h foreclosed on\nApplicant\u2019s first and junior mortgages, which had a combined note value of\n$1,317,000.00 (R.T., at 64), and purchase mortgages on his principal residence in\nNovember 2007 (see exs. 3 through 5 and B; R.T., at 57-58).   While it is not clear\nwhether the first mortgage holder\u2019s (creditor 1.h) foreclosure wiped out the junior lien\nholders, Applicant covered himself against any deficiency risks associated with the\njunior holders by including them in his bankruptcy petition (see exs. 3 and B; R.T., at 57-\n65).\nBesides his personal residence, Applicant owned another piece of realty, that\ndepreciated considerably during the real estate down turn in his region.  His property\nwas disposed of through a short sale in October 2007 for $1,400,000.00 (R.T., at 65-\n66).  Creditor 1.j\u2019s $250,000.00 deficiency is covered in Applicant\u2019s amended\nbankruptcy schedules (ex. B).  Creditor 1.j held a third lien on the house that was sold\n\n4\nand received only $55,000.00 of the more than $300,000.00 the creditor was owed\n(R.T., at 67-71).  Because of some uncertainty over whether this creditor\u2019s claims were\ncovered by the terms of the short sale, Applicant included the $250,000.00 balance in\nhis amended bankruptcy schedules (see ex. B).  The claim was reportedly discharged in\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy along with his other real estate-related debts.\nApplicant documents his completing the required instructional counseling over\nthe internet to satisfy his bankruptcy requirements (see ex. C; R.T., at 96-97).  His\ncertification does not detail the contents of the course instruction.\nFollowing the closing of his real estate franchise in April 2007, Applicant was\nunemployed for almost a year (R.T., at 35-36,76-77).  Without a job or personal income\nto cover any of his personal debts, Applicant essentially lived off his credit cards.  He\ntried to work with his creditors and his franchise parent on payment plans, but to no\navail (R.T., at 32-33).  In June 2008, he and his wife petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\n(see exs. 3, A and B), and obtained their discharge in December of 2008 (R.T., at 38).\nHis amended bankruptcy schedules include all but one of the unsecured debts listed in\nthe SOR that were not previously resolved (see exs. 3 and B), and total $2,924,949.42\nin the aggregate.  Still, Applicant claims the parent suit remained pending when he\npetitioned for Chapter 7 relief, but was discharged in his bankruptcy (R.T., at 33-38).\nThe claim is listed in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy schedules, and was presumably discharged\nwith his Chapter 7 discharge.\nExcepted from Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy schedules is the listed judgment debt of\ncreditor 1.b (see exs. 3 and B; R.T., at 39).  Credit reports in 2008 indicate a judgment\nwas entered against Applicant in favor of creditor 1.b (an architect who sued Applicant)\nin May 2008 for the amount of $89,364.00 (see exs. 2 and 4).  Applicant denied any\nentered adverse judgment against him in behalf of creditor 1.b (R.T., at 39).  He\nassured that the case initiated by his franchise\u2019s landlord was dismissed in January\n2008 (presumably after the building was foreclosed), but provided no documentation.\nWhether a default judgment was actually entered against him without his knowledge is\nnot clear. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent January 2009 credit report (ex. 5) notes the creditor 1.b\njudgment was satisfied and included in Applicant\u2018s bankruptcy petition in June 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy schedules (see exs. 3 and B) do not list the creditor 1.b claim,\nthough, and Applicant does not provide any convincing explanations why the listed\ncreditor 1.b\u2019s claim was dismissed.  Whether the judgment was actually satisfied out of\nproceeds from the building\u2019s foreclosure and later dismissed (as Applicant claims), or is\nstill an enforceable or potentially enforceable judgment against him is unclear. Since it\nwas never noticed in any of Applicant\u2019s schedules, conceivably, it is alive and\nenforceable depending on the outcome of the building foreclosure Applicant mentions. \nNonetheless, the Government does not provide any evidence or claims to\ncounter the proofs that the creditor 1.b judgment is no longer enforceable (either\nbecause the underlying claim was dismissed as Applicant claims, or the entered\n\n5\njudgment was satisfied). So, based on the documentation compiled in evidence,\ninferences warrant that the listed creditor 1.b\u2019s judgment was disposed of (either by\ndismissal of the underlying claim or judgment satisfaction).    \nApplicant currently owns two cars (a 1998 Lexus and an 2000 Honda) and is up\nto date with his current bills (R.T., at 80, 87-88).  His 2008 bankruptcy was a first-time\nbankruptcy experience for him.  He earns a monthly gross salary of about $8,000.00 a\nmonth and nets around $5,500.00 a month (R.T., at 84).  He has a  net monthly\nremainder that currently runs about $300.00 a month (R.T., at 85), a figure that is\nsomewhat lower than the $762.10 remainder he included in his personal financial\nstatement (compare ex. 3; R.T., at 85-86).  He attributes the reduction to an increase in\nhis monthly rent (R.T., at 85). \n Applicant estimates he will have $75,000.00 coming based on his expected sale\nof his home that his lender is marketing at a price of $570,000.00 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 85-\n86).  He has $350,000.00 remaining on the first note; so, that any returned equity from\nthe eventual sale will be allocated to his bankruptcy creditors.  Applicant does not\nexpect to see any personal proceeds from the ultimate sale of the home (R.T., at 86).   \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\n\n6\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs),  \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a manufacturing engineering associate for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts over a five-year period spanning 2004: and\n2007, some disputed and some acknowledged..  Considered together, and without\nresolution, they raise  security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nAGs where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which\ncan raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds. Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts exceeding\n$2,900,000.00 (some business-related to his failed franchise) and his past inability to\naddress any of these debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions\n\n7\n(DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC \u00b619(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts\u201d and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n                                                                \nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable to several reasons: a cashed-strapped real\nestate franchise that was facing legal claims from its parent and other creditors that it\ncould not address, a collapsing real estate market that imperiled both his company and\nhimself personally, the closing of his business and his ensuing loss of employment,\nfinally the bankruptcy of his firm and himself.  Applicant\u2019s discharged debts include both\nhis business-related car repossessions and suits initiated by the listed judgment\ncreditor and his franchise\u2019s parent firm and his personal debts.  All of Applicant\u2019s\nscheduled debts (including those listed in the SOR) were discharged in Applicant\u2019s\ncompleted Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts (both actual and contingent) for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy were substantial: almost $300,000.00 worth of unsecured debts that he\nsought to discharge in bankruptcy.  Some are business-related, but much more are\npersonal.  Collapse of the real estate market in his region in 200 doubtlessly\ncontributed to the financial misfortunes of his company and himself.   Judgment issues,\nthough, remain over the funding he had available to start his franchise in 2002, and the\nprofits he earned between 2002 and 2006.  A capital cushion from his franchise\u2019s\nprofitable years during the area\u2019s strong real estate market could have helped to\nshoulder losses during the ensuing downturn, when he and his company were\nconfronted by a barrage of claims from his company\u2019s parent and a host of other\ncreditors that they were ill prepared to address. Historical context is especially\nimportant here, because of the imposing debt load that prompted his company to close\nin April 2007 and pursue bankruptcy and Applicant himself to petition for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy just six months later.  Additional information about his franchise start-up,\nhis prior work experience, his counseling lessons, and the impressions of persons who\nwork and socialize with him would have been most helpful in balancing determined\njudgment and trust lapses with his restorative efforts. The record, however, is lacking in\ninformation covering these important areas.                                                                     \n                         \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with his\nfailed franchise, the collapsing real estate market in his region, and his ensuing\nunemployment following the closing of his company, he may take advantage of MC \u00b6\n20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial considerations.  Extenuation\ncredit is limited, though, due to the size of his accumulated debt and the absence of\nany documented information about the nature and conditions that accompanied his\nstart-up and operation of his real estate franchise. \nMitigation credit is also only partially available to Applicant based on his\npersonal and business bankruptcy discharges. Applicant is able to demonstrate\ncredible disputes with a couple of his listed creditors (creditors 1.b and 1.j), but no\n\n8\nmore.  Age of the debts at issue is partially covered by two of the mitigating conditions\nfor financial considerations: MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and MC \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d has some applicability.  MC \u00b6  20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d has some applicability as well relative to the\ntwo listed creditors he disputed before he discharged their claims in bankruptcy.  . \nWhile the internet counseling advice Applicant relied on to complete his\nbankruptcy requirements does not technically fit the definition of counseling services\nunder the Guidelines, he is to be credited with earnestly looking for sources of financial\nadvice with the resources available to him and taking productive advantage of the\ninternet advice he received in addressing his debts.   He may take limited advantage\nMC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nBased on his initiated efforts to date, prospects for his gaining important insights in\nhandling his finances in the future are somewhat promising.  His efforts lack seasoning,\nthough, and remain a work in progress.  \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s actions and overall demonstration of\njudgment and trustworthiness is limited by the absence of l information about his\nfranchise start-up, his prior work experience, his counseling lessons, and the\nimpressions of persons who work and socialize with him.  Market conditions associated\nwith the downturn in real estate prices certainly contributed to the financial problems\nthat resulted Applicant\u2019s closing his business, losing his home to foreclosure, and\npursuing bankruptcy protection, but these extenuating conditions alone are insufficient\nto enable him to overcome the financial risks associated with his large accumulations\nof delinquent debts that he could not address without bankruptcy protection.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, his documented steps taken to resolve them, and the absence of\ninformation about his start-up history, his work with his current employer, and his\npersonal life, it is still too soon to make safe predictive judgments about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to\nhis business and personal debts sufficiently to carry his evidentiary burden.  More time\nis needed for Applicant to make the case that he mitigated government concerns about\n\n9\nhis finances.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered\nby sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.k of the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.k:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old (Tr. 4, 23). In 1987, he received his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science (Tr. 4, 23). He has worked for a government contractor for the last 15 months as a software engineer (Tr. 24). He has never held a security clearance and he is currently seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 24). He is not married and does not have any children (Tr. 25).

Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by unemployment (Tr. 28-32). Applicant was unemployed for approximately one year before he declared bankruptcy in 2001 (Tr. 26). Prior to becoming unemployed his salary was about $55,000 annually (Tr. 27). In March 2001, Applicant filed for bankruptcy because he had about $20,000 in delinquent debt, and in June 2001, Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (SOR \u00b6 1.e, Tr. 25, 27-28). 1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

Applicant\u2019s \nstatement of reasons (SOR) lists a March 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and four \ndelinquent debts, totaling $34,761. Applicant settled and paid three of the four \ndelinquent SOR debts and the remaining SOR debt is in a payment plan. Clearance is \ngranted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 19, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nSensitive Positions (e-QIP) (SF 86) (GE 1). On November 28, 2008, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary \ndecision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified information, citing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive) and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nApril 24, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nissued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn January 2, 2009, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s undated response to the SOR \n(GE 7). On January 12, 2009, Applicant requested a hearing using email (Hearing \nExhibit I; Transcript (Tr.) 12-14). On March 6, 2009, Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed. The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2009. On March 20, 2009, \nDOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 13, 2009. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits (GEs 1-4) (Tr. 18), and Applicant offered six \nexhibits (Tr. 20-22; AE A-F). There were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-4 (Tr. 22), \nand AEs A-F (Tr. 21-22). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the \nhearing notice (GEs 5-7). I received the transcript on April 21, 2009. I held the record \nopen until April 23, 2009, to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence (Tr. 47-49, \n51-52). On April 23, 2009, I received additional evidence (AEs H-K), and these \ndocuments were admitted without objection. I closed the record on April 23, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted his responsibility for the debts listed in \nthe SOR (GE 7; Tr. 14). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After \na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings \nof fact.   \n \nApplicant is 50 years old (Tr. 4, 23). In 1987, he received his bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncomputer science (Tr. 4, 23). He has worked for a government contractor for the last 15 \nmonths as a software engineer (Tr. 24). He has never held a security clearance and he \nis currently seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 24). He is not married and does not have \nany children (Tr. 25). \n \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) lists four delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nto 1.d), totaling $34,761. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by unemployment \n(Tr. 28-32). Applicant was unemployed for approximately one year before he declared \nbankruptcy in 2001 (Tr. 26). Prior to becoming unemployed his salary was about \n$55,000 annually (Tr. 27). In March 2001, Applicant filed for bankruptcy because he had \nabout $20,000 in delinquent debt, and in June 2001, Applicant\u2019s debts were discharged \nunder Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (SOR \u00b6 1.e, Tr. 25, 27-28).  \n  \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant was employed from September 2001 until September 2006. He was \nunemployed from September 2006 until February 2007 (Tr. 28-29, 31). He was \nemployed until August 2007, and then unemployed from August to December 2007 (Tr. \n32). He has been employed from January 2007 to the present with his current employer \n(Tr. 32).     \n \nApplicant established through his hearing statement and the documents that he \nprovided that three of his SOR debts were settled and paid or paid in full. One debt is in \na payment plan. He waited until shortly before his hearing to resolve his SOR debts \nbecause he was nervous about the economy and did not want to commit substantial \nfunds to his delinquent debts until he had amassed more funds, and he wanted to be \nmore confident about retention of his employment (Tr. 46-47). The resolution of his SOR \ndebts is more specifically described as follows:  \n \n(1) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($8,312) is a credit card debt (Tr. 36).  On February \n20, 2009, it was settled for $3,400 and paid in a lump sum with a check (Tr. 36-37; AE \nB, E); \n \n(2) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,798) related to purchase of advertising for \nApplicant\u2019s business (Tr. 40, 42). It was paid in full on March 19, 2009 (Tr. 40; AE J);  \n \n(3) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($9,651) is a credit card debt (Tr. 34). On March 5, \n2009, it was settled for $6,000, which Applicant paid in a lump sum with a check for \n$6,000 (Tr. 35-36; AE A, D); and \n \n(4) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($15,000) is for an installment loan (Tr. 37). The \namount of the debt has increased to $19,300 (Tr. 38; AE F). Applicant has a payment \nplan with payments for the first year of $100 monthly beginning April 15, 2009 (Tr. 39; \nAE K). The payments gradually increase to $600 monthly in the fifth year (Tr. 39). \nApplicant does not have to pay interest on the debt (Tr. 39; AE K).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $99,000 (Tr. 43). His net salary is about \n$60,000 annually (Tr. 43). He does not have a 401K or retirement plan (Tr. 44). He has \nabout $5,000 in his checking account, and $35,204 in his savings account, as of March \n17, 2009 (Tr. 44-45; AE I). He has one credit card and he pays off the balance every \nmonth (Tr. 45). He is current on his state and federal taxes (Tr. 46).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his SOR response and at his \nhearing. In 2001, he fell behind on some of his debts because of unemployment. In \nJune 2001, his debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  In \n2006 and 2007, four additional debts, totaling $34,761, became delinquent due to \nunemployment. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n                                           \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. He did not dispute the legitimacy of any of his delinquent SOR debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(a) because his delinquent debts also \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  He resolved three of four delinquent debts and the \nremaining debt is in a payment plan. \n \nApplicant receives full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of unemployment. Unemployment caused his financial \nproblems in 2001, which he used bankruptcy to resolve his debts. In the last two years, \nhe was unemployed from September 2006 to February 2007 and from August to \nDecember 2007. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and paid three of his \nfour SOR debts prior to his hearing.2 His remaining SOR debt is in a payment plan.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant paid (or settled and paid) three of four of his \ndelinquent debts, and the remaining debt is in a payment plan. There are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He understands the \nsecurity implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent \ndebt. He has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed good \nfaith3 in the resolution of his SOR debts.    \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts.  He should have maintained contact with his \ncreditors, keeping them apprised of his financial progress.  Nevertheless, his resolution \nof three of four SOR debts, and his entry into a payment plan on the remaining debt is \nadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In 2001, Applicant\u2019s \ndebts became delinquent because of his unemployment. In 2001, he utilized a Chapter \n7 bankruptcy to eliminate his delinquent debts. By the end of 2007, he had four \ndelinquent debts, totalling $34,761. He failed to keep his accounts current and negotiate \nlesser payments when his income decreased, showing some financial irresponsibility \nand lack of judgment. When he returned to full employment in December 2007, he did \nnot aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution. His history of delinquent debt raises \nsufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. Applicant is a law-abiding citizen. His \nunemployment is the source of all of his financial problems. Ultimately, he paid or \n \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nsettled three of four delinquent SOR debts. His remaining SOR debt is in a payment \nplan. His remaining debts are all current. He has about $35,000 in his savings account. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is 50 years old. He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science. He \nhad worked for a government contractor for the last fifteen months and his annual salary \nfrom the contractor is now $99,000. He made mistakes, and his debts became \ndelinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments by actually paying or settling \nand paying three of his four delinquent SOR debts, and the remaining debt is in a \npayment plan. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. He has \ndemonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the \nDepartment of Defense as a defense contractor. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On August 27, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 12, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant as to Guideline E and SOR paragraph 1.h.  Those favorable findings\n1\nare not at issue on appeal.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.1\nApplicant asks that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision be reversed, arguing that he is doing\neverything he can to resolve his financial problems and the denial of a clearance will adversely\nimpact his employment situation.  He also questions whether the Judge saw the post-hearing\nsubmissions he faxed to her.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe adverse impact of a decision on an Applicant\u2019s employment situation is not a factor that\ncan be considered in evaluating his security clearance eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21012\nat 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2005).\nThe Judge\u2019s decision indicates that Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission \u201cwas timely received\nand marked as (AE) A.\u201d  Decision at 2.  There is a presumption that the Judge considered all the\nevidence in the record unless she specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623\nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  Applicant has not rebutted that presumption.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  She specifically noted that Applicant had not voluntarily paid any debts listed in the\nSOR and had admitted that he was going to file for bankruptcy.  Decision at 5.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still\nongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  She reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

The total amount of delinquent debt that Applicant owes\nis approximately $46,596 (GE 2 and 3).\nApplicant admitted owing the debts listed in the SOR. The debt listed in SOR \u00b6\n1.a and 1.f belong solely to Applicant. He acknowledged that since his name was also\non the other accounts, he was responsible for the remaining debts as well. Applicant\u2019s\nwages are garnished for child support arrearage ($1.803) listed in \u00b6 1.h. The other\ndebts in the SOR have not been paid. Applicant planned to file for bankruptcy in\nSeptember 2008 but decided to refinance his home through a company that will also\nchallenge debts and dispute certain accounts (AE A). The letter from the company\nstates that Applicant is enrolled in a \u201ccredit restoration\u201d program. If Applicant learns that\nhe is responsible for the debts, he will use money from the refinancing to pay the\n\n3\ndelinquent debts to his creditors. He will also volunteer for deployment to Iraq to help\npay the delinquent bills.\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he would pay the past due mortgage\npayment of $2,000 listed in SOR \u00b6 1. f (Tr. 66). He did not submit any documentation for\nthe record. He also did not provide any letters of recommendation from his employment\nor character references as promised.\nApplicant earns approximately $49,700 yearly. He also receives his military\nretirement. When he receives travel reimbursement and per diem for temporary duty, he\ntries to save a portion of the money for his bills (Tr. 40). After monthly expenses he has\na net remainder but was not clear on the amount. He is paying on his current car loan.\nApplicant completed his December 31, 2007 security application. In that\napplication he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28(a) and (b) which asks for information on\ndebts either 180 days delinquent in the last seven years or 90 days currently delinquent\n(GE 1 ).\nApplicant explained that he completed the security questionnaire online at work\non the computer.  He indicated that he did not believe he had any delinquent debts\nbecause the debts were actually that of his ex-wife. He explained that he had good\ncredit and purchased a house in 2006 with no credit problems (Tr. 43). He said it was a\nmisunderstanding and that he did not learn about the debts in the SOR until the security\nclearance investigation. He was credible in his testimony that he had no intent to\ndeceive the government.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\n\n4\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts from his divorce and inability\nto pay child support. He did not meet some of his financial obligations from 2004 until\nthe present time. His credit reports confirm the delinquent debts totaling approximately\n\n5\n$46,596. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2004. He accumulated some delinquent debt due to his\nseparation and divorce and months of unemployment when he retired from the military\nin 2006. While those circumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not\nend at that point. He admits that he was going to file for bankruptcy. He has not paid\nany debts in the SOR and intends to refinance his house to pay the accounts. His\nconduct over the last six months with his creditors does not remove security concerns or\ndoubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. This potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has been\nsteadily employed since September 2007. He did experience separation, divorce, and\nsome unemployment but he also has debt that do not stem from that situation. Applicant\nwas not as aggressive as he should have been in initially addressing or resolving his\ndelinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c) Applicant pays child support in the amount of\n$801 per month (Tr. 11). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.@ Applicant contacted a mortgage company for \u201ccredit restoration\u201d and financial\ncounseling. He is investigating his credit report to dispute some accounts. He is paying\na child support arrearage through a garnishment. I find his efforts are insufficient to\ncarry his burden in this case. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply in\npart.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that his wife\nowed the majority of the creditors. He submitted no documentation concerning specific\ndetails.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2007 security application, he did not\nlist any debts that were 90 or 180 days delinquent. He explained that he believed that\nhe did not have delinquent debts of 90 or 180 days. Despite the fact that the\nquestionnaire was not checked \u2018yes\u201d on either section, I found him credible. He bought\na house in 2006 with no credit problems. The allegation of falsification is\nunsubstantiated. I do not find that he deliberately provided false information on his SF\n86 in 2005.\nThus, Applicant\u2019s allegation of deliberate omission is mitigated under AG 17(f)\n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must\n\n7\nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are not sufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant served in the US Army for 20 years.\nAfter leaving the military, he had a difficult transition to civilian life. His wife left the\nmarriage and he had many bills to pay. He has not been aggressive in paying his\ndelinquent debts. His plan of action is to refinance his house and use the proceeds to\npay for the delinquent debts. This plan is not in place at this time. He has disputed many\naccounts but did not provide sufficient documentation for this proposition. At this time,\nApplicant has not met his burden of proof to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I-l:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 24, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\nmis-weighed the evidence.  Specifically, he argues that the Judge\u2019s decision focused almost\nexclusively on the government\u2019s adverse evidence and did not give enough consideration to the\nmitigating evidence presented by Applicant.  As a result, Applicant believes that he did not receive\na fair decision under the whole-person concept.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s\nultimate adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nA review of the decision indicates that the Judge reasonably considered evidence favorable\nto the Applicant including such things as: his explanations as to the circumstances alleged in the\nSOR; his educational and employment accomplishments; his favorable performance reviews and pay\nraises; his honorable service in the U.S. Army; his reputation for having a positive attitude, for being\ncooperative, for being responsive to customers, and for being an effective manager; his recent\nengagement of a debt resolution company and his settlement or partial payment of several\noutstanding debts; and the fact that he has held a clearance since 1987.  Decision at 2-4, 9.  A Judge\nis presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 08-06559\nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 2, 2010).  There is nothing in the Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal or in the\ndecision to rebut the presumption that the Judge fairly considered all of the evidence including\nevidence favorable to the Applicant.\n  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of\nfact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence\noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App.\nBd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability\nto argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nAs to Guideline F, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had significant\noutstanding debts, and was still trying to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the foregoing,\nthe Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant \u201cha[d] not yet established a track record of\nfinancial responsibility\u201d and that his financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the\n\n3\npossible application of relevant conditions.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that as to the Guideline F allegations the\nJudge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is\nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nHis admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 2008. He has been employed by defense contractors for about 29 \nyears. (GX 2 at 13.) He received a security clearance in October 1987, which he is \nseeking to continue. (GX 1 at 9; Tr. 10-11.)  \n \n \nApplicant married in September 1969. He has no children. His wife does not work \noutside the home. (Tr. 52.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application reflects active duty and reserve service \nin the U.S. Army from January 1967 to May 1975. (GX 1 at 7.) He did not submit any \ndocumentary evidence of his military service, but in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories and his answer to the SOR, he described himself as a decorated \nVietnam veteran who was awarded the Bronze Star. (Answer at 7; GX 2 at 13.) He \nattended college from January 1974 to May 1977 and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering.   \n \n \nApplicant began working for a defense contractor in October 2001, while \ncontinuing his employment by another defense contractor until February 2002. (GX 8; \nGX 11.) He decided to leave his first employer because of disagreements with \nmanagement and a dispute about assignments. He was working for his first employer \non an Army-specific radio system for use at the battalion and brigade level when he \nbegan developing a test facility for a joint service radio system for his second employer. \nHe testified he told his second employer and its legal office that he was still working for \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhis first employer. He informed his first employer that he intended to leave his job, but \nhe did not disclose his dual employment. (GX 3 at 6; AX L at 3; Tr. 85.) He was able to \nperform work for both employers without his supervisors knowing about it, because he \nhad no day-to-day direct supervision. (Tr. 89.)  \n \n \nThe Code of Corporate Conduct published by Applicant\u2019s first employer provided: \n\u201cIf you consider undertaking any activity, including an investment, that may create an \nactual or apparent conflict of interest, you must seek approval of the activity in advance \nfrom your supervisor or from the Corporate, Company or Value Center Director of \nHuman Resources.\u201d (GX 10 at 15.) In August, 2000, Applicant acknowledged in writing \nthat he had received a copy of the Code of Corporate Conduct and acknowledged his \nobligation to comply with it. (GX 9.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he was aware of his obligation to obtain \napproval before working for another company if there was a potential conflict of interest. \n(Tr. 84; GX 9.) He testified he told his first employer that he had already begun working \nfor his second employer, but he did not identify his second employer. He had nothing in \nwriting showing approval for his dual employment. He testified he did not care if his \nsupervisor objected, because he was not \u201cgetting along\u201d with him and did not feel he \nowed him an explanation. (Tr. 82-83.) He did not know if his two employers were \ncompeting for the same contracts. (Tr. 92, 94.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history on his security clearance application did not \nreflect his dual employment. Instead, it reflected that Applicant ended his first job and \nbegan his second job in August 2001. (GX 1 at 3-4.) When Applicant was confronted \nwith the evidence obtained from his two employers, he stated he mistakenly extracted \nthe information from his notes and was unaware of the mistake until a security \ninvestigator pointed it out. (GX 3 at 2, 6.) \n \nApplicant quit a job with a defense contractor in May 2003 because he was \nharassed after a dispute with his manager\u2019s wife, who also worked for the same \ncontractor and was supervised by her husband. He quit a job with a defense contractor \nin September 2004 after refusing to relocate to another state. (GX 1 at 1-5.) In an \ninterview with a security investigator in April 2008, he told the investigator that his job \nchanges and resulting salary decreases contributed to his financial problems. (GX 2 at \n4.) His employment history on his security clearance application does not reflect any \nperiods of unemployment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two most recent performance reviews commented favorably on his \ntechnical knowledge and experience, responsiveness to customers, positive attitude, \ncooperativeness, and effective management. (AX N; AX O.) He has received two pay \nraises since starting his current job, and his take-home pay has nearly doubled since \nearly 2008. (Tr. 67.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nBetween 1996 and 2003, Applicant was the victim of identity theft, and several \ncredit cards were opened in his name. (GX 1 at 10; GX 2 at 4.) He paid off the debts, \nand none of them are included in the delinquent debts listed in the SOR. (Tr. 47.) \n \n \nStarting around 2001, Applicant accumulated the seven delinquent debts totaling \nabout $34,400 that are alleged in the SOR. He has acknowledged that his delinquent \ndebts arose in part because of his financial mismanagement. (GX 4 at 4; Tr. 105.) He \nadmitted he made no payments on his delinquent debts after he started his higher-\npaying job in September 2008. He testified he did not make any payments or payment \narrangements because he was on probation and did not want to make any \ncommitments until he was more secure in his new job. (Tr. 64-65.) His wife has taken \nover the management of the family finances. (Tr. 68.) After paying his mortgage, car \npayment, and living expenses, he has a net monthly remainder of at least $3,000. (Tr. \n73.)  \n \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b (AX T.) In \nJuly 2010, he made the first payment pursuant to an agreement with the creditor alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. (AX C, D, and S; Tr. 47.) In August 2010, he engaged a debt resolution \ncompany to assist him with the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but the debt was not yet \nresolved when the record closed. (AX H at 13; Tr.57-58.) \n \n \nApplicant testified he had been unable to make contact with the creditors alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. He indicated at the hearing that he had additional contact \ninformation about the two creditors, but he did not submit any additional information \nabout them in his post-hearing documents. (Tr. 45-46.) At the hearing, he submitted \nextensive handwritten notes of his attempts to track down his creditors. (AX E; AX I.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the two judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were \npartially paid by garnishment of his pay. (Tr. 48-49.) His pay vouchers from a previous \nemployer reflect a \u201cwage assignment,\u201d but his pay voucher from his current employer \ndoes not reflect any deductions to pay these judgments. (GX 2 at 15-18.) The two \njudgments are still unsatisfied.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling about $34,400. The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history establishes two disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, not yet \nfully resolved, and not the result of circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s employment changes \nand resultant salary reductions were voluntary choices, and not conditions beyond his \ncontrol. He admitted financial mismanagement. Neither prong of this mitigating condition \nis established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant has engaged a debt resolution company, but the documentation does not \nreflect the kind of financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition. He has \nmade some recent progress in resolving his debts, but it is too soon to conclude that his \nfinancial problems are under control. I conclude this mitigating condition is not \nestablished.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past \nirresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for \na security clearance.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were \npartially paid by wage garnishment by a previous employer. Involuntary collection by \nwage garnishment does not establish good faith. Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and to track down the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e were recent, \nshortly before the hearing. He took no significant actions to resolve his financial \nproblems until he realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. The timing of his \nefforts indicates that his primary motivation was to protect his clearance, and not a \nsense of duty or obligation. I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndenied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, but he has since acknowledged them and \nmade payments on them. He admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h, disputed \nthe amounts due, and provided documentary evidence of payments on them. He denied \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e because he was unable to contact the collection \nagents for the debts, but he has not articulated or documented a basis for disputing the \nunderlying debts. I conclude this mitigating condition is established for the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h, but it is not established for the remaining debts. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to report a potential conflict of interest to \nhis two employers when he held full-time jobs with both. The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201cdeliberately \nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 16(b). Unlike AG \u00b6 16(a), this disqualifying condition does not specifically encompass \nintentional omissions. Thus, Applicant\u2019s intentional failure to inform his first employer \nabout his dual employment does not raise AG \u00b6 16(b). However, Applicant\u2019s deceptive \nbehavior and intentional violation of his employer\u2019s Code of Corporate Conduct \nestablish several disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information; \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \ndeception was not \u201cminor.\u201d It was a serious breach of trust. Although he did not work on \nprojects common to both employers, he did not know whether his two employers were \ncompeting on any contracts, and he was not concerned about it.  \n \n \nApplicant compounded his deception by misstating his employment dates on his \nsecurity clearance application and giving a false explanation to a security investigator \nfor misstating them. He was no neophyte to the security clearance process and knew \nthe importance of accurate information. I found his explanation for misstating his \nemployment dates implausible and not credible in light of his previous experience with \nsecurity clearance applications and his clear memory of his dual employment \nconcerning what he did for each employer, where he did it, and why he did it. In light of \nall the circumstances, I conclude that the first prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso minor\u201d) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso much time has passed\u201d) also is not \nestablished. Although Applicant\u2019s deceptive behavior with an employer happened more \nthan nine years ago, he continued the deception on his security clearance application in \nMay 2008 and subsequent security interviews. The third prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso \ninfrequent\u201d) is not established because of Applicant\u2019s subsequent deceptive behavior. \nThe fourth prong (\u201cunique circumstances\u201d) is not supported by the evidence. Overall, \nApplicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his reliability and trustworthiness. I conclude that AG \n\u00b6 17(c) is not established. No other enumerated mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are applicable. \n \n \nBecause the SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified his security clearance \napplication, his misrepresentation of his employment dates and subsequent false \nexplanation for the misrepresentation may not be an independent basis for denying his \napplication. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an \napplicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; \nto evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole \nperson analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations \nomitted). I have considered the evidence of Applicant\u2019s falsifications for these limited \npurposes. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. His employment record reflects that \nhe is a talented engineer. He has served honorably in the Army, worked in support of \nnational defense for most of his adult life, and held a security clearance for many years. \nOn the other hand, he has not yet established a track record of financial responsibility, \nand his deceptive behavior casts doubt on his current trustworthiness and reliability.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe SOR is undated.  Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR stated that it was transmitted to him by letter dated March\n1\n18, 2009.  The Judge utilized that date in her summary of the case history.  Decision at 1. \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR stated that he did not desire a hearing.  The record is silent as to whether he\n2\nchanged his mind or whether Department Counsel requested the hearing, in accordance with Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.7-8.\nApplicant was represented by counsel at the hearing.  Applicant states in the Appeal Brief that he did not request a\nhearing and that the Judge erred in stating otherwise.  He does not raise an issue of denial of due process.  The Judge\u2019s\nerror is harmless.    \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 18, 2009,  DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n1\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  The Judge conducted a hearing.   On November 24, 2009, after the hearing,\n2\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\nintentionally falsified his security clearance application (SCA) is supported by substantial record\nevidence; whether the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence is erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we\naffirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant has been employed in the Defense industry since 1986.  He\nhas held a security clearance for the past 23 years.  He used marijuana in 1986 \u201con a quarterly basis;\u201d\nfrom 1986 to 1994 \u201con a periodic basis;\u201d and in 2005 \u201cthree or four times.\u201d  Decision at 2.  In 1994\nhe was arrested for possession of marijuana and for public drunkenness.  \nIn completing his SCA, Applicant omitted information about (1) his use of marijuana in\n2005; (2) his use of marijuana while holding a security clearance; and (3) his 1994 arrest.  The Judge\nfound that these omissions were deliberate.  \nApplicant is an excellent worker who enjoys a good reputation for stability, reliability, and\ncompetence.  \nOn appeal, Applicant denies that he intentionally omitted the above-described information\nfrom his SCA.  He points to his testimony concerning difficulty he had in completing the electronic\nversion of the SCA.  Having examined the Judge\u2019s decision and the record, we conclude that her\nfindings about Applicant\u2019s intentions are supported by substantial record evidence.  See  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d).  The\nJudge explicitly considered Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his intentions.  Decision at 3.  However,\n\nFor example, she pointed to inconsistent statements by Applicant as to his reasons for leaving out the requested\n3\ninformation.\nshe plausibly explained why the record as a whole supported her finding of intentional omissions.3\nWe conclude that the challenged findings are not in error.  Neither do we find any basis for\nconcluding that the Judge weighed the evidence in an erroneous manner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007)\n(The Board will not disturb a Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence unless it is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law).   \n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electrical Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant admitted, in part, and denied in part, with explanations, the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline. The Applicant has been employed in the defense industry since 1986. He has worked for the same defense contractor from 1986 until October 2007, and has held a security clearance for the past twenty-three years. He started with his current employer in October 2007. Although he was aware of the illegality of marijuana; and that his company policy and DoD prohibited its use, he used marijuana during various periods in 1986, from 1990 to 1994 and again in 2005, on an occasional basis.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Judith A. Litzenberger, Attorney At Law\nNovember 24, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing,\n(e-QIP) on October 28, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On or about March 18, 2009,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and E for Applicant. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 9, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on June 3, 3009.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day,\nscheduling the hearing for June 25, 2009.  The Government offered five exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered four exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D and testified\non his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on July 9, 2009, to\n\n2\nallow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  Applicant submitted five\nadditional exhibits referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits E through I.  The\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on July 6, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43 years old and has a Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electrical Engineer, and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted, in part, and denied in part, with explanations, the\nallegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\nThe Applicant has been employed in the defense industry since 1986.  He has\nworked for the same defense contractor from 1986 until October 2007, and has held a\nsecurity clearance for the past twenty-three years.  He started with his current employer\nin October 2007.  Although he was aware of the illegality of marijuana; and that his\ncompany policy and DoD prohibited its use, he used marijuana during various periods in\n1986, from 1990 to 1994 and again in 2005, on an occasional basis.  (Government\nExhibit 3).            \nApplicant explained that he started using marijuana back in high school and\ncontinued experimenting with it in college.  In 1986, while working part-time in the\ndefense industry, he used marijuana on a quarterly basis.  (Tr. p. 53).  He used it to help\nhim relax.  He used marijuana from 1986 to 1994, on a periodic basis.  (Tr. p. 55).  He\ndid not use marijuana at all between 1994, and September 2005.  (Tr. p. 54).  In 2005,\nhe used marijuana about three or four times, with friends, to deal with stress from his\nmarriage, and this was out of character for him.  Since 2005, he has not used any\nmarijuana.     \nApplicant asserted that in 2001, when he completed a previous security\nclearance application, he revealed his marijuana use and his 1994 arrest for possession\nof marijuana and being drunk in public to his security manager.  He testified that he was\ntold that it would not be a issue, since everyone did a little bit in college.  (Tr. pp. 56-57).\nA copy of the Applicant\u2019s 2001 security clearance application confirms that the Applicant\ndisclosed his marijuana use from 1990 to 1994.  On this security clearance application,\nand also in his 2005 application, he provided information in the remarks section to\nclarify his answers regarding his difficulties in entering data on the computer in\nresponse to the question regarding his use of illegal drugs.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit G).\n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant admitted with explanations the allegations set forth in the SOR\nunder this guideline.  \nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing dated October 28, 2007.  Question 24(a) of the application asked him if\nsince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, had he illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine etc.  The Applicant responded,\n\u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to\nreveal that he had used marijuana at all and namely, as recently as November 2005.  \nQuestion 24(b) of the same application, asked the Applicant if he ever illegally\nused any controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer,\nprosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a\nposition directly or immediately affecting public safety.  The Applicant responded, \u201cNO\u201d.\n(See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to reveal\nthat he had used marijuana in 1986, 1990 to 1994 and again in 2005, while holding a\nDepartment of Defense security clearance.\nQuestion 21 of the same application, asked the Applicant if in the last 7 years he\nhad consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.)\nor had he consulted with another health care provider about a mental health related\ncondition.  The Applicant responded, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a\nfalse answer.  The Applicant failed to reveal that in October 2005, he sought out mental\nhealth treatment with his physician.  During that visit, his physician diagnosed him with\nbi-polar disorder and prescribed medication known as \u201cZyprexa\u201d and referred him to a\npsychiatrist for further treatment.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 5).  Technically, the\nApplicant consulted his personal physician and not a mental health professional,\nhowever, the diagnosis and prescribed medication was for a mental condition.  With this\nnoted confusion, however, this allegation is found for the Applicant.    \nThe Government amended the SOR at the hearing to include an additional\nallegation.  Allegation 2(c) was added under Guideline E: the allegation read, \u201cThe\nApplicant falsified material facts on his questionnaire dated October 28, 2007, in\nresponse to question 23(d) wherein he deliberately failed to disclose his arrest of 1994\nfor possession of marijuana and being drunk in public.\u201d  Question 23(d), of the same\napplication, asked the Applicant if he has ever been charged with or convicted or any\noffenses related to drugs or alcohol.  The Applicant responded, \u201cYes\u201d, and listed his\narrest for DUI in January 1989.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  The Applicant failed to\ndisclose his more recent arrest in 1994, for Possession of Marijuana and being drunk in\npublic.  He stated that the computer system would not allow him to do so, or maybe he\nsimply forgot.  (Tr. p. 73).  \n\n4\nThe Applicant testified that he had taken the security questionnaire home to\ncomplete on his home computer, and had about a day and a half to finish it.  (Tr. p. 33).\nHe gave a number of explanations as to why he did not disclose his recent marijuana\nuse on his security clearance application.  Since he had revealed his previous drug use\non earlier security clearance applications, he thought the information was part of the\nrecord.  (Tr. p. 57).  He believed that he should have read the questions more carefully\nand apparently misinterpreted the question.  (Tr. p. 34).  He was embarrassed about his\nillegal drug use and simply did not put it on the application.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to\nSOR). Since he told his security officer and his supervisor about his bi-polar medical\ndiagnosis, he did not think to reveal his marijuana use because he believed it to be\ninsignificant.  (Tr. p. 71).  He finally realized that he made a mistake and should have\nrevealed the 2005, marijuana use on his 2007, security clearance application.  (Tr. p.\n70).  He stated that he did not intend to omit anything on the questionnaire or deceive\nthe Government.  (Tr. p. 22).                \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals from 1986 to 1987 and 1990 to 2005 reflects\nthat he either \u201cmeets\u201d or \u201cexceeds\u201d performance requirements in every category.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  Applicant\u2019s performance appraisals from 1988, 1989 and 2006\nalso reflect that he consistently \u201cexceeds the responsibilities of his job and is a\ncandidate for promotion.\u201d   (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  Applicant has received promotions\nand salary increases over the twenty years that he has worked for the defense\ncontractor.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  Various awards, bonus and merit pay increases\nwere given to the Applicant for his contributions to the defense industry.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit C).  \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s current supervisor reflects that she considers the\nApplicant to be stable, dependable, reliable, professional and competent.  He is\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n\n5\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n25.(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fidiciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \n\n6\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d                                              \n      \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and/or dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H) and that he falsified his\nsecurity clearance application (Guideline E).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n7\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H and E of the SOR.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant used marijuana while holding a DoD\nsecurity clearance for many years during his twenty-three year history with the defense\nindustry.  He used marijuana knowing that it was prohibited by law and clearly prohibited\nby the Department of Defense.  His most recent use of marijuana occurred three or four\ntimes in 2005.  This demonstrates poor judgment and untrustworthiness.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, his use of marijuana in 2005 is considered recent in light of\nthe fact that he was using it while holding a security clearance, which prohibits a\nfavorable determination in this case.       \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia, and 25(g) any illegal\ndrug use after being granted a security clearance apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  I find his past use of marijuana to be recent and of security\nsignificance.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement. \nWith respect to the Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his 2005 marijuana use on his\n2007 security clearance application, I find that it was intentional.  Considering all of the\nApplicant\u2019s excuses, I find only one to be credible.  Clearly, as a middle aged man who\nis well respected in the company, he was embarrassed about his continued illegal drug\nuse and did not want to disclose it.  There is no other plausible explanation for his\nconduct.\nI find that the Applicant intentionally sought to conceal his 1994 arrest on his\nsecurity clearance application in response to question 23(d).  The Applicant\u2019s excuse\nthat the computer system would not allow him to place the entry is without merit.  He\nclearly knew how to operate the computer program and place entries in the remarks\nsection of the application, because he listed his 1989 arrest for DUI.    \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition, 16(a) deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the\nApplicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application by concealing his\nmarijuana use.  Consequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct.  \nAs previously discussed, subparagraph 2(b) of the SOR is found for the\nApplicant. \n\n8\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 43 years old, mature,\neducated, successful, well respected, and a long time employee of the defense industry,\nwho has held a security clearance for twenty-three years.  I have considered all of the\nevidence, including the favorable performance appraisals, as well as the awards, and\nletters of recommendation.  The fact remains, however, that he used marijuana, during\nvarious periods of those twenty-three years while holding a security clearance, and last\nused it in 2005.  He also did not disclose this use on his 2007 security clearance\napplication.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth\nunder all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\npoor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.

On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 2, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On June 4, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me and \nissued a Notice of Hearing on June 16, 2009. The case was heard on July 8, 2009, as \nscheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and called one witness. Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through X were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript on July 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegation contained in \u00b6 \n1.a and admitted the allegation contained in \u00b6 2.a. His admission is incorporated into \nthe following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old and married. He has three children, two sons and one \ndaughter. One son is in the U.S. Navy and the other son is in the U.S. Air Force. His \ndaughter is a homemaker. In February 2000, another son was murdered while on active \nduty with the U.S. Navy.  \n \n \nApplicant has had a \u201cfantastic military career.\u201d (Tr. 29) He enlisted into the U.S. \nAir Force in September 1972 and retired in September 2001. He was recalled after \nSeptember 11, 2001, and retired again in February 2002. He was a chief master \nsergeant (E-9) and worked in communications during his entire military career. He \nserved in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Desert Storm, Japan, Korea, Guam, Philippines, \nand other places. He earned six meritorious service medals and held a Top Secret \nsecurity clearance during his career. (Tr. 27) He has an associate\u2019s degree in \ntelecommunications that he earned while in the service and is a certified security \nspecialist. After he retired from the Air Force, Applicant began working for Government \ncontractors on military bases. Currently, he is the configurations manager for the \ninformation technology component of the military command that serves about 140,000 \nusers. (Tr. 31)  \n \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant was involved in a serious motor vehicle accident on \nhis way home after he consumed five beers with friends at a bar. He lost control of his \ncar and hit an oncoming car. Both he and the other driver were injured and taken to the \nhospital. He received a concussion and had surgery on his jaw. The other driver had \nsurgery to replace his hip. His blood alcohol level was over the legal limit of 1.0 and less \nthan 2.0 at the time of the accident. (GE 4) \n \n \nIn March 2003, Applicant was charged with Aggravated Vehicular Assault, a \nfelony. In July 2004, he pled guilty to the charge and was found guilty. The court \nsentenced him to one-year imprisonment and three years of probation. He was fined \n$1,000, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for two years. He was confined from \nAugust 2005 to July 2006 (less than one year), and then placed on probation. His \ndriver\u2019s license was reinstated in August 2006. (Tr. 35-38) He was released from \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprobation in July 2007, after serving one year. Subsequently, he resolved a civil \nnegligence case brought by the other driver for $20,000. (GE 4 at 2)  \n \n       \nApplicant began consuming alcohol after his first overseas assignment in 1974 \nwhen he was 22 years old. He continued to consume alcohol until the accident in 2003, \nafter which he ceased drinking alcohol for two years. (Tr. 56) He now consumes alcohol \nperiodically and generally at home. (Tr. 39; 66) He does not drink alcohol and drive. (GE \n4; Tr. 38) He was never diagnosed as having an alcohol disorder or treated for \nalcoholism.1 He received counseling while in prison, which included information about \nalcohol abuse. (Tr. 57) He has never been involved in any other alcohol related incident. \n(Id.)   \n \n \nApplicant called a witness who assumed Applicant\u2019s previous supervisory \nposition in the Air Force and subsequently became Applicant\u2019s supervisor when \nApplicant began his current employment. He has a Top Secret clearance. He is aware \nof Applicant\u2019s car accident and incarceration. He has complete confidence in Applicant\u2019s \nintegrity and leadership. He asserted that Applicant was held in high esteem in the Air \nForce and continues to be respected in his job. In testifying about Applicant, he stated:  \n \n \nAnd I\u2019ll tell you, [Applicant] behind closed doors by himself does the right \nthing. He not only does it in public. I\u2019ve come behind him and found \nnothing but quality, integrity, honesty, leadership. \n \n[Applicant] rose to the rank of chief master sergeant and was a chief \namong chiefs. He was a person in that position that was sought out by \nother chiefs for situations, what to do, right or wrong, or dealing with \npersonnel. \n \nSince retiring, I\u2019ve had interactions with [Applicant]. And in or out of \nuniform, it hasn\u2019t changed. In my mind, I really honestly from my heart, this \nis an individual that has strong integrity and understands, fully \nunderstands the mission of keeping the Government safe. (Tr. 75) \n \n \nApplicant presented his case in a very organized manner and provided numerous \nrelevant exhibits. He was candid and remorseful about his behavior. He took full \nresponsibility for the situation. (AE 1; Tr. 35) He admitted that the incident has changed \nhis life, essentially for the better, as a result of what he has learned personally and from \nthe support he has received from his family and friends. (Tr. 42)  He is committed to \navoiding any situation that could put him at risk of harming himself or others. (Tr. 61-62) \n \n                                                          \n1After serving on active duty in 1992, Applicant received psychiatric treatment for post-traumatic \nstress disorder. He also received treatment and counseling for depression after his son was killed in \n2000. He continues to see a psychiatrist for anti-depressants, on an as needed basis. He takes \nmedication if and when he feels depressed. (Tr. 61-62) His psychiatrist has never recommended that he \nbe evaluated for substance abuse. His mental health has not been raised as a security concern.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted 14 letters, strongly supporting his request for reinstatement \nof his security clearance and addressing his integrity and work ethics. The authors \ninclude former colleagues, current colleagues, a lawyer, and friends. All of them have \nknown Applicant for a number of years and are aware of his conviction and \nincarceration.  A teammate of Applicant for the past seven years wrote that Applicant \n\u201chas been a stellar employee abiding by and enforcing the many DoD and AF \ninstructions that guide our daily work activities. He has executed his many duties with \nloyalty and dedication to accomplishing our mission and the larger AF vision.\u201d (AE R) A \ncolleague for 17 years noted that he and other colleagues are very aware of Applicant\u2019s \nsituation and his decision never to consume alcohol and drive. (AE S) A retired chief \nmaster sergeant, who has known Applicant for more ten years, considers Applicant to \nbe, unequivocally, trustworthy. (AE U) A former technical sergeant serving under \nApplicant (now a lawyer) believes that Applicant\u2019s accident was an isolated incident in \nwhich Applicant made a serious error in judgment. However, he does not believe that \nApplicant could have been promoted to chief master sergeant without having \ndemonstrated a history of exercising reliability and good judgment. (AE P)  A retired \nsenior noncommissioned officer in the U.S. Air Force and the program manager for \nApplicant\u2019s command wrote: \n \nThe likelihood that this one event, born of the confluence of \ncircumstances, could possibly repeat itself or be exploited for any gain is \nnegligible, and I am fully confident based upon my observations of \n[Applicant\u2019s] integrity and bearing in his daily life, that he has put his past \nbehind him after paying for his actions, and should be permitted continue \nto serve the [command]. (AE V) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set \nout in AG \u00b6 21: \n Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes a condition that could a raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \nIn January 2003, Applicant was involved in a serious automobile accident that \noccurred after he consumed alcohol. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualification. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of that disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe resulting security concern.  AG \u00b6 23 includes one condition that may potentially \nmitigate a security concern arising from alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s accident occurred in January 2003, over six years ago. There is no \nevidence of similar alcohol-related incidents having occurred before or after that date. \nBased on the record, this was an isolated incident in Applicant\u2019s life in which he \nexercised poor judgment, and it does not cast doubt on his current reliability or \ntrustworthiness. Applicant has limited his alcohol consumption over the past several \nyears and no longer consumes alcohol and drives a car. His colleagues have observed \nhis commitment to never drink and drive. AG \u00b6 23(a) applies.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. \nApplicant admitted that in July 2004, he pled guilty to a felony and was \nsubsequently imprisoned for less than a year from August 2005 until July 2006. He \nserved one year of probation and had his driver\u2019s license suspended for two years. The \nevidence is sufficient to establish said disqualification. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32 (a) applies for the same reasons as discussed above under AG \u00b6 22(a). \nThe criminal conduct occurred more than six years ago. Applicant provided substantial \nevidence of successful rehabilitation. He was released two years early from the three \nyear term of criminal probation. His driver\u2019s license has been reinstated. His colleagues \nattest to his current good employment record. There are no subsequent incidents of \ncriminal activity. He did not hesitate to express his remorse over his conduct and his \ncommitment to monitoring his future behavior. AG \u00b6 22(d) applies. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s age, history, \nand candid testimony. Applicant is a 55-year-old man, who honorably served the United \nStates for 29 years. He had a distinguished and successful military career, as \nevidenced by awards and numerous letters from current and former colleagues, all of \nwhom are aware of his criminal conviction. In January 2003, he made a grave error in \njudgment when he decided to drive after consuming alcohol. That mistake caused him \nirreparable harm, as he now carries a felony conviction and period of incarceration on \nhis record. Other than that isolated incident (albeit very serious), there is nothing else in \nhis background that raises security concerns. In fact, his military service and \nsubsequent civilian employment document a life of responsibility and achievement. After \nlistening to him testify and observing his demeanor, I believe that it is unlikely that any \nsimilar lapse in good judgment will occur. This man has been very humbled and \nshamed by the experience. He is very remorseful and cautious about his conduct, \nespecially as it relates to the consumption of alcohol. He does not pose a security risk. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the criminal conduct and alcohol \nconsumption guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 55-year-old vice-president and finance manager for a government contractor. He has been with his current employer for 14 years. Applicant has a bachelor of science degree in accounting and a post-graduate certificate in a related field. He is married. Applicant has a history of intermittent drug abuse spanning from 1970 to 2006, during which he used and purchased marijuana, an illegal substance. As a teenager, Applicant used marijuana about once every month or two between 1970 and about 1972. He then started working and he \u201cjust kind of got away from it.\u201d He completed college in 1983, where he may have used marijuana on rare 1 occasions. He then entered the workforce as a professional. By 1988, he had been 2 granted a security clearance. He used the drug again between 1996 and 1999, 3 abusing the drug \u201ca couple of times a month\u201d as an escape from marital stress. In the 4 interim, he denied drug use on a 1996 security clearance application. In about February 1997, he was granted Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access by another agency. By 2000, Applicant had divorced his first wife and quit using marijuana.5 In 2005, Applicant started dating again. The couple soon married and remain married today.

On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, which are effective for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an August 10, 2009, response, Applicant admitted all allegations set forth in\nthe SOR and requested a hearing on the matter. DOHA assigned the case to me on\nOctober 7, 2009. For medical reasons, Applicant requested that the hearing be\ndelayed. Department Counsel and Applicant later agreed to a hearing date of January\n22, 2010. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on November 13, 2009.\nApplicant\u2019s convalescence was protracted. The hearing was then rescheduled for\nFebruary 9, 2010. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Applicant gave testimony\nMarch 25, 2010\n\n Tr. 18.\n      1\n Tr. 38.\n      2\n Tr. 39.\n      3\n Tr. 41.\n      4\n Tr. 44.\n      5\n Tr. 52. During the interview for his SCI access renewal, Applicant\u2019s disclosure was made after hours of\n      6\nquestioning concerning a variety of issues, including all the answers on his SF-86. W hile he ultimately\nadmitted past and more recent marijuana use, he miscalculated some of the specific dates of incidents where\nmarijuana was present or involved during the interview and on his SF-86. He did not intend to mislead\ninterviewers with regard to specific dates. See, e.g., Tr. 54-55.  \n2\nand presented no documents. Applicant was given through February 19, 2010, to\nsubmit any additional documentation. Department Counsel offered eight documents,\nadmitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-8 without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding\nwas received on February 18, 2010. In the interim, between February 12, 2010, and\nFebruary 15, 2010, Applicant emailed two documents to Department Counsel, who\nforwarded those materials to me on March 9, 2010. Noting no objection, I accepted\nthem into the record as exhibits (Exs.) A-B. With Applicant\u2019s materials received, the\nrecord was closed on March 9, 2010. Based on a review of the testimony, submissions,\nand exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden under Guideline E, leaving\npersonal conduct security concerns unmitigated. Security clearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 55-year-old vice-president and finance manager for a government\ncontractor. He has been with his current employer for 14 years. Applicant has a\nbachelor of science degree in accounting and a post-graduate certificate in a related\nfield. He is married. Applicant has a history of intermittent drug abuse spanning from\n1970 to 2006, during which he used and purchased marijuana, an illegal substance. \nAs a teenager, Applicant used marijuana about once every month or two\nbetween 1970 and about 1972. He then started working and he \u201cjust kind of got away\nfrom it.\u201d  He completed college in 1983, where he may have used marijuana on rare\n1\noccasions.  He then entered the workforce as a professional. By 1988, he had been\n2\ngranted a security clearance.  He used the drug again between 1996 and 1999,\n3\nabusing the drug \u201ca couple of times a month\u201d as an escape from marital stress.  In the\n4\ninterim, he denied drug use on a 1996 security clearance application. In about February\n1997, he was granted Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) access by another\nagency. By 2000, Applicant had divorced his first wife and quit using marijuana.5\nIn 2005, Applicant started dating again. The couple soon married and remain\nmarried today. The presence of her son in their household was stressful. To alleviate\nthat stress, he again used marijuana from 2005 until about October 2006. Eventually,\non October 6, 2006, he reluctantly confessed to investigators that he had been using\nmarijuana.  He also disclosed the fact to his employer. He expressed his desire to quit\n6\n\n Tr. 27.\n      7\n Ex. B (Doctor\u2019s Letter, dated Feb. 15, 2010). See also Tr. 62.\n      8\n Id. The doctor noted that the \u201cdrug treatment program was coordinated by\u201d the EAP for Applicant\u2019s\n      9\nemployer, with initial intake and evaluation made by that body prior to referral to an addiction specialist and\nsubsequent counseling and education.\n Tr. 61.\n      10\n Tr. 28.\n      11\n Tr. 48.\n      12\n Id.\n      13\n Ex.

Around the same time, he tested positive for marijuana\nduring a job-related urine screening and hair follicle testing in October 2006.  He was\n7\nthen treated for marijuana use through his employer\u2019s employee assistance program\n(EAP) from December 2006 until February 2007. He was referred to a Licensed Clinical\nDrug and Alcohol Counselor (LCDAC) and his treatment was overseen by a medical\ndoctor. His program was \u201cconsistent with the standard of care provided by a one-time\noffense for marijuana.\u201d  During the program, Applicant tested negative for marijuana six\n8\ntimes over a 12-month period. At the completion of the program, his prognosis was\ndeemed \u201cexcellent\u201d by both the counselor and the medical doctor. The doctor, the\nregional medical director of a health system and medical review officer of workplace\ndrug testing for Applicant\u2019s employer, wrote that Applicant\u2019s program was a \u201crequired\ndrug treatment counseling program\u201d and he noted that Applicant\u2019s long-term prognosis\nwas \u201cexcellent.\u201d  Applicant  consulted a medical doctor regarding drug use in 2009 as a\n9\nfollow-up \u201cminor session.\u201d10\nThe EAP and counseling helped Applicant understand stress was the root of his\nreliance on marijuana. He now recognizes what causes him stress and deals with such\nfactors without resort to drugs. He has changed his group of acquaintances and social\nvenues to avoid drugs. He began exercising, focusing on home projects, and\nconcentrating on his \u201cwhole new life change.\u201d  His wife no longer uses marijuana, it is\n11\nnot permitted in their home, and they avoid acquaintances who use it.  He notes that\n12\n\u201cat this point I\u2019m very clean. Every day it\u2019s been three and a half years almost, three\nyears four months. I can honestly tell you it feels good. It feels good not to carry that\nweight of doing the wrong thing.\u201d  He has no intention of using drugs again in the\n13\nfuture. Applicant signed a statement of intent not to use drugs again. It has a clause for\nautomatic revocation of a security clearance for any future violation of the prohibition\nagainst drug use.  He is genuinely contrite and embarrassed about his past drug use\n14\nand his failure to disclose it earlier.  He has been drug-free since at least October 6,\n15\n2006. In March 2007, however, his SCI access was revoked by another government\nagency.\n\n Tr. 44.\n      16\n Tr. 43.\n      17\n Tr. 57.\n      18\n Tr. 55-56.\n      19\n Response to the SOR, dated Aug. 10, 2009; Tr. 58-59.\n      20\n Tr. 59.\n      21\n4\nApplicant has always known marijuana is a proscribed substance. He also knew\nthat its use was prohibited while having access to classified information.  He never\n16\nused marijuana on the job or went to work while feeling its effects. He never drove a\nvehicle while impaired by the drug. Moreover, Applicant never sold marijuana or any\nother drugs, although he may have shared any marijuana he was using when a friend\nwas present.17\nIn completing his January 3, 2002, SF-86, Applicant denied having used illegal\ndrugs since the age of 16 or in the preceding seven years (Question 27). He also\ndenied ever using illegal drugs while employed and maintaining a security clearance\n(Question 28). At the time he certified his SF-86, he knew that he had a security\nclearance and SCI access.  Applicant stated that he rushed through the application\n18\nand, in the process, miscalculated the dates of his drug use. He acknowledges that his\ndrug use had, at the time, continued until 2000. He stated that his negative answers\nwere a \u201cmistake\u201d and that his answers were \u201cwrong.\u201d  In his response to the SOR,\n19\nhowever, Applicant admitted that his answers were false.  He ultimately stated, \u201cI\u2019d\n20\nhave to say [his drug use] was omitted on purpose because I was headed down the\npath of wanting to stop and just didn\u2019t.\u201d21\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      22\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      23\n Id.\n      24\n Id.\n      25\n5\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n22\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n23\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n24\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.25\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the most\npertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\n\n AG  \u00b6 24.\n      26\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      27\n Id. at  \u00b6 24(b).\n      28\n6\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances,\n26\nand include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other\nsubstances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\n27\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n28\nApplicant admitted he used marijuana with varying frequency between 1970 and\nat least 1972, from 1996 until at least 1999, and from 2005 until October 2006. During\nsome or all of those times, he purchased the illegal drug. His use of marijuana\ncontinued after he was granted a security clearance and access to SCI. He tested\npositive for marijuana during a drug screening in 2006 and was treated for marijuana\nuse as a first-time offender from December 2006 until about February 2007. Such facts\ngive rise to Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse), AG\n\u00b6 25(b) (testing positive for drug use), and AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being\ngranted a security clearance). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s infrequent teenage use may be dismissed as a youthful\nindiscretion, his adult use was mostly in response to problems at home, such as his\nseparation and his step-son. After quitting marijuana in early October 2006, he\ncompleted an EAP and a treatment/counseling program, where he learned alternative\nmethods for dealing with stress and received an excellent prognosis. In 2009, he again\nmet with a medical doctor regarding drug use as a follow-up \u201cminor session.\u201d \nIn the interim and since, Applicant has demonstrated good judgment and\nbehaved responsibly. He is now committed to staying drug free and has changed his\nlifestyle to accommodate that change. Together, he and his wife avoid people and\nplaces associated with drugs. He clearly recognizes that a return to drugs could\njeopardize his job of 14 years. He has signed a statement of intent to not use drugs\nagain lest his security clearance be revoked. He has fully divulged all aspects of his\npast drug use, demonstrated contrition, and detailed how his life has improved since\nbecoming drug-free and open about his past drug use. Drug Involvement Mitigating\nCondition AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AG \u00b6 26(b)(1)\n(disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts); (2) (changing or avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation),\nand, based on the facts presented, AG \u00b6 26(d) (satisfactory completion of a prescribed\ndrug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      29\n Id.\n      30\n Similar denials were noted on his 1996 application.\n      31\n7\nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly\nqualified medical professional) apply. Drug use security concerns are mitigated.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n29\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  Here,\n30\npersonal conduct concerns arose because Applicant denied having used illegal drugs\nsince the age of 16 or in the seven years preceding in his January 2002 SF-86, and\nbecause he denied using illegal drugs while possessing a security clearance.31\nAdditionally, he only revealed his past drug use during an October 2006 interview with\nan agent from another agency after hours of interrogation. Such facts are sufficient to\nraise Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and AG \u00b6 16(b)\n(deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an\nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official\ngovernment representative). Consequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate\nthe resultant security concerns.\nApplicant denied his teenage use of marijuana and his use of the illegal drug\nbetween 1996 and 1999 when he completed his January 2002 SF-86. He did not\ncorrect his falsification until his October 2006 interview, where he stalled in directly\nanswering questions regarding his past drug use before finally divulging his past and\nrecent marijuana use. As a result, his SCI access was revoked. In light of these facts,\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-\nfaith effort to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted\nby with the facts) does not apply. Similarly, Applicant actively concealed a history of\nmarijuana use dating from 1970 until 2006 for over 35 years before reluctantly admitting\nthe truth in October 2006. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \n\n AG \u00b6 30.\n      32\n Ex. 1 (SF-86, dated Jul. 25, 1996) and Ex. 2 (SF-86, dated Jan. 3, 2002), citing to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n      33\n8\nApplicant\u2019s eventual honesty and disclosure must be commended. While\nApplicant ultimately disclosed the truth, his drug use and his disclosure occurred years\nafter he received a security clearance and access to SCI, access which was ultimately\nrevoked. Moreover, his October 2006 disclosure did not occur until hours into his\ninterview with investigators. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) does\nnot apply.  None of the other mitigating conditions apply.  In the absence of mitigating\nconditions, personal conduct security concerns remain.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nThe concern under this guideline is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d32\nIn completing and certifying his SF-86 answers as \u201ctrue, complete, and accurate to the\nbest of [his] knowledge,\u201d Applicant understood that \u201ca knowingly and willfully false\nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.\u201d  In his\n33\nresponse to the SOR, he admitted that his answers regarding past drug use and use of\nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance (Questions 27-28) were false. Therefore,\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless\nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply.\nConsequently, it is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security concerns raised.\nIn October 2006, Applicant ultimately disclosed his past drug use. Since that\ntime, he has changed his lifestyle regarding drugs, been forthcoming, expressed\ncontrition over both his drug use and his past falsifications, and demonstrated genuine\nremorse over his lapses of judgment with regard to concealment of required\ninformation. His falsifications represent aberrations in an otherwise crime-free personal\nhistory. Meanwhile, he has excelled in his professional life and otherwise demonstrated\nveracity and good judgment. Given such factors, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition\nAG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community service) apply.\nCriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated.   \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\n\n Applicant\u2019s testimony indicates he had a security clearance as far back as at least 1988. Tr. 39.\n      34\n9\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Speaking in Applicant\u2019s favor, he is a mature, educated, and successful\nbusinessman. He and his wife eschew people and places associated with drugs. He\nspends his free time pursuing physical activity and working on home improvements.\nApplicant quit using marijuana after using it intermittently over a majority of his life. He\ndid so through counseling which helped him learn that he relied on the drug during\ntimes of stress, and he now knows how to handle stress through alternative means. He\nsuccessfully completed an EAP referral that included counseling by a licensed\nprofessional and was overseen by a medical doctor. Last year, he voluntarily followed\nup with his rehabilitation with a medical doctor. Applicant now handles stress\nappropriately. He has no intention of using marijuana again and was given an excellent\nprognosis by a medical doctor. Applicant mitigated drug use security concerns. \n Of more immediate concern are Applicant\u2019s falsifications on his 1996 and 2002\nSF-86 forms, as well as his initial reluctance to divulge the truth regarding his drug use\nto interviewers in 2006. While he raised sufficient mitigating conditions for these actions\nunder the criminal conduct guideline, concerns raised under the guideline for personal\nconduct remain. Applicant started using drugs in 1970. The documentary evidence\nshows that he concealed his drug use from at least the time he certified his 1996 SF-86\nuntil 2006, while his testimony indicates the concealment probably dated back to at\nleast 1988.  Consequently, he failed to take corrective action for 10 to 18 years, at\n34\nwhich point he only reluctantly disclosed his drug use to investigators during a lengthy\ninterview. Whether 10 or 18 years, the delay is significant. Of equal or greater\nsignificance is the fact that he used marijuana while maintaining a security clearance\nand had access to SCI. Both the security clearance vetting process and the\nmaintenance of a security clearance are built on a foundation of trust, candor,\ntrustworthiness, and reliability. Applicant\u2019s concealment and his use of marijuana while\npossessing a security clearance and access to SCI undermined that foundation to its\n\n10\ncore. Although Applicant has demonstrated the requisite qualities for one seeking\naccess to sensitive information for the past three-and-a-half-years, more time or further\nrehabilitative efforts are needed to mitigated personal conduct security concerns. With\nsecurity concerns regarding personal conduct unmitigated, I conclude it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Hoffman, Esquire,  Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the hearing transcript, pleadings, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal \nConduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. His eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nApplicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on January 29, 2008. On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 8, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2009. \nI convened a hearing on July 6, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 \nthrough 5 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf. He called one witness and offered seven exhibits, which were marked Ex. A \nthrough G, and admitted to the record without objection. Because Applicant\u2019s Ex. B, a \nletter of character reference, was undated and unsigned, I kept the record open for one \nweek, until close of business on July 13, 2009, so that he could provide a signed and \ndated version of Ex. B if he wished to do so. Applicant also asked to include in the \nrecord a copy of a handwritten employment application he filed in about October 2007, \nand I granted his request to do so. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nJuly 15, 2009. By memorandum dated July 23, 2009, Department Counsel reported that \nApplicant failed to submit any post-hearing documents.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.), and three allegations of disqualifying conduct under \nAG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.g.). In his Answer to the SOR,   \nApplicant admitted five Guideline J allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.) and provided \nadditional information. He denied the three Guideline E allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through \n2.c.), and he did not address SOR \u00b6 1.f., which alleged that the information set forth in \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.c. violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and was felonious criminal conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 21, \n35; Ex. D.)  \n \n \nApplicant, who is 39 years old and employed in telecommunications by a federal \ncontractor, seeks a security clearance. He attended college for about 2 \u00bd years, but did \nnot complete a degree. He married in 1998. His wife is a citizen of Japan. His three \nchildren, ages 10, 8, and 5, are dual citizens of the United States and Japan. (Ex. 1; Tr. \n140-141.) \n \n \nAt the time of his hearing, Applicant had been unemployed for approximately \nthree months. His employer had suspended him from duty pending the adjudication of \nhis eligibility for a security clearance. (Tr. 35-38, 76.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was responsible for criminal conduct occurring \nbetween 1990 and 2008. In March 1990, when he was 19 years old, Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle1 was broken into.  For protection, he purchased a sawed-off shotgun from a \n                                            \n1 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he purchased the gun for protection after his apartment \nwas broken into. In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he purchased the gun for \notection after his truck was broken into.

An employee of the store notified police. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Possession/Manufacturing/Selling a \nDangerous Weapon, a felony. Applicant pled guilty to the charge and was given 36 \nmonths of summary probation. In December 1991, he violated his probation and was \nsentenced to 90 days in jail. He served 31 of the 90 days in jail.  (SOR \u00b6 1.a.; Answer to \nSOR; Ex. 2 at 2; Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 46-47, 8\n \n \nIn May 1990, Applicant allowed a young woman to reside in his apartment for \nabout two months. Applicant thought she would pay him rent, but she did not do so. He \nwas behind in his rent and he pressured her to pay her share of the rent. Applicant \nknew she did not have enough money in her account to write a valid check, and if she \nwrote a check to him and he cashed it, it would be returned for insufficient funds. \nNevertheless, he drove her to a bank, she made out a check to him, and he cashed it. \nThe check the woman gave to Applicant was drawn on a third person\u2019s account.  \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Forgery. He admitted in open court that he \nwas guilty of the crime, but, on the advice of his court-appointed attorney, he pled no \ncontest to conspiracy to commit Forgery. He was found guilty of the crime and \nsentenced to three days in jail and 24 months of probation.  (SOR \u00b6 1.d.; Answer to \nSOR; Ex. 2 at 2; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 47-48, 90-93.) \n \n \nIn 1997, Applicant was pulled over by police in City A of State X and given a \nticket for speeding. His automobile insurance had expired. He was ordered to appear in \ncourt and provide evidence of valid automobile insurance. Applicant did not appear in \ncourt as ordered, his license was suspended by operation of law, and a warrant was \nissued for his arrest. He was subsequently arrested in July 1997, charged with Failure \nto Appear, fined, and detained in jail for 24 hours. His father provided money to pay his \nfine and secure his release, and he also gave Applicant money to purchase automobile \ninsurance. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.; Answer to SOR; Ex. 2 at 3; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 48-50, 99-103.)   \n \n \nOne year later, in July 1998, Applicant was arrested in City B of State X and \ncharged with (1) Failure to Appear, (2) Possession of Stolen Property, and (3) Traffic \nOffense. Charge (1) was dropped when City B learned that Applicant had appeared and \nanswered that charge in City A one year earlier. Charge (2) was also dropped when \nApplicant provided evidence of a valid driver\u2019s license, valid automobile insurance, and \nvalid license plates. Applicant pled guilty to the traffic offense charge and paid a fine of \n$270. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.;Answer to SOR at 1; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 50-52, 103-107.)  \n \n \nApplicant played poker regularly with a group of about two dozen people. \nApplicant believed that one of the individuals in his poker group, Mr. X, spoke with some \nof the other players and accused Applicant of cheating. This made Applicant angry. In \nFebruary of March 2007, the poker group met at Mr. X\u2019s house to play poker. Applicant \nconfronted Mr. X and asked him why he had told other players that he was cheating. Mr. \n         \n \n \n The sawed-off shotgun, an illegal weapon, was confiscated by the police and destroyed.

Applicant denied that he was responsible for \nd he was fired by his employer for committing the crime, and he \nsserted that he had resigned voluntarily. In light of his previous statements, Applicant\u2019s \n \ntherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is for \nufacture/Selling a Dangerous \neapon. However, he deliberately failed to disclose his arrest and conviction in 2007 \nX denied talking about Applicant and telling others that he cheated. (Ex. 2 at 7; Tr. 113-\n114.) \n \n \nDuring a break in the game, Applicant took Mr. X\u2019s credit card, which was sitting \non a rack in his kitchen. He considered taking the card as a \u201cpractical revenge joke.\u201d \nApplicant used the credit card to purchase snacks and beer for the poker game, and he \ntold the other players that he had purchased the food. Two or three days later, Applicant \nagain used the credit card to purchase snacks for another poker game. He estimated he \ncharged approximately $150 to $200 on the stolen card. After he used Mr. X\u2019s credit \ncard for the second time, Applicant reflected on his actions and decided he had made a \nmistake. He estimated he had possession of the credit card for about one week. Then, \nhe threw Mr. X\u2019s credit card in a trash can at a gas station. Some unknown person then \nacquired the card and charged approximately $90\nb\nthe additional charges, but he paid all of the unauthorized charges made to the credit \ncard account. (Ex. 2 at 7-8; Tr. 42-46, 113-119.) \n \n \nMr. X learned that the card had been taken and he reported the theft to the \npolice. He accused Applicant of stealing the card. In April 2007, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with (1) Credit Card Theft, a felony, and (2) Identify Fraud, a felony.  As the \nresult of a plea bargain, he pled guilty to credit card larceny, a felony offense that did \nnot require jail time. He received a sentence of six months in jail, suspended, and was \nsentenced to one year of probation. His year of probation ran from November 2007 to \nNovember 2008. An unknown individual informed Applicant\u2019s employer of his arrest. \nApplicant told an authorized investigator from the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) that he thought Mr. X was the person who reported this information to his \nemployer. As a result, Applicant told the authorized investigator and the police detective \nwho arrested him that his employer fired him for committing the crime. At his hearing, \nApplicant denie\na\ndenial was not credible. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.; Ex. 2 at 7-9; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Ex. 5; Ex. A; Tr. 107-\n111, 120-124.) \n \n \nOn January 29, 2008, Applicant executed an e-QIP. Section 23 of the e-QIP asks \nabout an Applicant\u2019s police record.  Section 23a asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged \nwith or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice.)\u201d Section 23b asks: \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of a \nfirearms or explosives offense?\u201d  An individual responding to these questions is advised \nto \u201creport information regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or\no\ncertain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court \nissued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the questions posed in Sections 23a and 23b of the \ne-QIP. He listed his 1990 conviction of Possession/Man\nW\n\n \n5 \n \n \nx. 5; Tr. 126-127.) \nant\u2019s employment \ncord.

(See section 1001 of title 18, United States \nCode.)\u201d (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts in an \ninterview with an OPM authorized investigator by telling the investigator that he used \nthe stolen credit card two times to purchase items totaling $150 to $200, when, in fact, \nhe knew and sought to conceal that he had used the credit card at least six times and \nhad spent about $1,200. (SOR \u00b6 2.c.)  Applicant denied the allegation. The OPM \ninvestigative report relies on information provided by Applicant. The OPM report states \nthat the stolen credit card had been used multiple times at multiple locations, and that \nApplicant was either working or on travel when some of the charges were made. \nAdditionally, Applicant provided a letter from the detective whose investigation resulted \nin his arrest for felony credit card theft. In his letter the detective stated that Applicant \ninitially denied involvement in the theft of the credit card but then admitted taking and \nfraudulently using Mr. X\u2019s credit card. The detective reported that Applicant \n\u201cacknowledged the severity of his mistake and wa\nre\n$1071.84 in fraudulent charges, despite believing several of the charges were not made \nby him.\u201d  (Answer to SOR; Ex.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\nially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\nle, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the \nsible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provid\n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nUnd\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \nApplicant admits a criminal history that spans 17 years.

I conclude that the record evidence is insufficient to establish that \n  \nunder AG \u00b6 31(a) and AG \u00b6 31(c).\nG \u00b6 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \n \nnce of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of \njurisdiction that, through administrative oversight, then failed to convey this information \nto a second municipal jurisdiction within the same state. \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged w\nprobation. After learning of his arrest, his employer fired him. Applicant\u2019s year of \nprobation ran from November 2007 to November 2008. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an e-QIP on January 29, 2008, while he was \nserving his probation for the felony crime of Credit Card Theft. He failed to report this \ncrime, as required, in response to Section 23 on the e-QIP. Additionally, he failed to \nreport in response to Section 22 on the e-QIP that he had been fired by his employer as \nthe result of his arrest. While Applicant denied at his hearing that he was fired, two \nsources, the OPM investigation report and the letter from the detective who investigated \nthe charges of credit card theft, corroborated Applicant\u2019s earlier statements that he had \nbeen fired after he was arrested. These facts, and the record as a whole, suggest that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his conviction for credit card theft and his \ntermination from his employment because of that conviction. He had reason to know \nthat, if he listed these facts on his e-QIP, he might not be awarded access to classified \ninformation. His denial at his hearing that he had not been fired, after he\nre\nity.  I conclude that Applicant\u2019s falsification of his answers to Sections 22 and 23 \nwas willful, deliberately false, and a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  \n \nApplicant also told the OPM investigator that he used the stolen credit card two \ntimes to purchase snacks totaling between $150 to $250. He denied using the credit \ncard several more times to charge items totaling about $1,200 and concealing this \ninformation from an authorized investigator. The record reflects that Applicant provided \nthis same information to the detective who arrested him for credit card theft, and the \ndetective\u2019s letter corroborates that Applicant pers\nApplicant\u2019s statements to the OPM investigator on this issue were willful, deliberately \nfalse, and a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001. \n           Applicant\u2019s 17-year criminal history and his deliberate falsification of that history \non his security clearance application raise concerns \n \nA\n\u201dallegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \n\u201cthere is evide\n\n \n9 \n \n \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \n \n \nsupervisors and colleagues praised his personal attributes and his \nprofessional skills.

I conclude that while AG \u00b6 \nd AG \u00b6 32(d) apply in part to mitigate Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct between \nrecent criminal conduct and his deliberate \nlsification of his e-QIP in 2008. \n \nersonal Conduct \n  \n \n \nability to protect \nlassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed and certified his e-QIP in 2008, he failed to report his \npast cr\n          \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior began in 1990, 19 \nyears ago. From 1998 until 2007, Applicant was not involved in criminal behavior. \nHowever, his criminal behavior resumed in 2007, and it was serious and substantial.  \nApplicant\u2019s past \nH\ner, the record does not provide assurances that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is \nunlikely to recur. \n \nIn 2008, Applicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP by concealing and failing to \nreport his criminal behavior in 2007 and his termination from his job in 2007.  His \nunwillingness or inability to inform the government about this past criminal behavior \nraises concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Additionally, \nhis deliberate falsifications sugge\n32(a) an\n1990 and 1998, they do not apply to his more \nfa\n \nGuideline E, P\nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nc\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \niminal behavior4 involving a felony conviction for credit card theft and the fact that \n                                  \n4 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, s\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstant\ntating:\n \nial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nmission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nurden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \no\nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nb\n\n \n10 \n \n \nhe had been fired from his job in 2007 when his employer learned of his felony \nconviction. In his answer to the SOR, he denied that his failure to disclose this \ninformation was deliberate falsification of material facts. The OPM report and the \ndetective\u2019s report state that Applicant stated he had been fired from his job in 2007. At \nhis hearing, he denied telling the OPM investigator and the detective that he had been \nfired from his job after his employer learned of his arrest for credit card theft. The record \nas a whole reflects Applicant\u2019s lack of candor on these issues and suggests he \ndeliberately concealed information that he feared would cause the government to deny \nhim access to classified information.  \n \n \nThe allegations in the SOR raise a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which \nreads: \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \n \n \nSeveral Guideline mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of this case. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated under AG \u00b6 17(a) if \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d If \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, \nomission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or \ninadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security process\u201d and \u201c[u]pon being made aware of \nthe requirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated fully and \ncompletely,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and \nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e) might apply if \n\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d   \n \nI closely observed Applicant at his hearing and I listened to his testimony \ncarefully.  I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on the e-QIP that \nhe executed and certified as true in January 2008. Nothing in the record suggests that \nhe took prompt good-faith action to correct the omissions, concealments or falsifications \nbefore he was confronted with the facts. (AG \u00b6 17(a).) Nothing in the record suggests \n                                                                                                                                             \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd.

Nothing in the record suggests that Applicant took \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \ncaused. (AG \u00b6 17(e).) I conclude, therefore, that none of the \npplicable personal conduct mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \nase. \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplica\nnt\u2019s \nconduc\nnine \nadjudic\n \n) the extent to \nhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \ne. \n \n \n of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

(AG \u00b6 17(b).) When he executed his security \nclearance application, Applicant knew he had been convicted of felony credit card theft \nand was, at that time, serving a term of probation for the crime. As a mature adult, he \nknew that his criminal behavior was not minor, so remote in time, so infrequent, or had \noccurred under such unique circumstances that it would not seriously impact his \neligibility for a security clearance. (AG 17(c).)

He is \nappreciated by others in his community as a valued volunteer. He is married and the \nfather of three young children. These actions suggested successful rehabilitation. \n \nHowever, after nine years of no reported criminal behavior, he became involved \nin serious criminal behavior in 2007. In 2008, he completed an e-QIP and deliberately \nfailed to report his past criminal behavior and termination from his job, thereby creating \n\n \n12 \n \n \nl qualification for one who would hold a security \nclearance. Applicant\u2019s failure to be truthful was deliberate. He made no effort to correct \nhis fal\nme with questions and doubts at the present \nme as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

On June 15, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael\nH. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30, and Department Counsel subsequently cross-appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6 E3.1.28.  \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.\nThe Judge found that, on two different security clearance applications, Applicant provided\nfalse answers concerning his prior illegal drug use.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s answers\nwere deliberately false and that, viewed in light of the entire record, Applicant had failed to mitigate\nthe Guideline E security concerns.

The Board has previously held that the \u201cparties and the Board have a right\nto know what findings the Judge is making with respect to all of the SOR allegations, not just some\nof them.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-22883 at 3 (App. Bd.

For one thing, failure to make findings with regard to all the SOR allegations substantially\nimpairs a losing party\u2019s ability to submit a meaningful appeal, preventing ab initio an examination\nof the evidentiary sufficiency of factual findings or compliance with Executive Order 10865 or the\nDirective.

The Judge\u2019s implicit assumptions ignore the possibility that Applicant might\nbe able to persuade the Appeal Board that one or more of the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are not sustainable.  And,\nthe Judge\u2019s implicit assumptions ignore the possibility that Department counsel might want to argue, in the alternative,\nthat any error identified by Applicant on appeal is harmless in light of the [remaining] sustainable findings and\nconclusions.\u201d  \nThe Supreme Court has defined a final action as a \u201cdefinitive\u201d statement of the agency on the matters at issue\n2\nin a case.  Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Oil, 449 U.S. 232, 239 (1980).  An agency must give \u201creasoned\nconsideration to all the material facts and issues\u201d in cases before it.  Greater Boston Television Corp. v. Federal\nCommunication Commission, 444 F.2d. 851, (D.C. Cir. 1970), cert. denied,. 403 U.S. 923 (1971).  The Board concludes\nthat the Directive imposes a similar requirement for finality in security clearance cases.    \nCompare ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006), in which the Board held that a Judge\u2019s\n3\nfailure to make findings and conclusions regarding one allegation in the SOR was harmless error.   \n3\nbe precluded from arguing that the decision is nevertheless sustainable in light of the findings under\nthe remaining Guidelines.   More fundamentally, without findings and conclusions on all the\n1\nallegations in the SOR, DOHA is precluded from issuing a final agency decision.   Finality, along\n2\nwith a complete record, is a necessary precondition to proper evaluation of an applicant\u2019s request for\nreconsideration, in accordance with Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.37 and 38.  In light of the above, the only\nrecourse is to remand the case to the Judge for a new decision, one in which he makes findings of\nfact and reaches conclusions as to all the allegations in the SOR.

On January 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On June 15, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael\nH. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30, and Department Counsel subsequently cross-appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6 E3.1.28.   The Appeal Board remanded the case for a new decision on September 21,\n2009.  The Judge issued a new decision on October 22, 2009, in which he again denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \n1\nThe Judge found that, on two different security clearance applications, Applicant provided\nfalse answers concerning his prior illegal drug use.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s answers\nwere deliberately false and that, viewed in light of the entire record, Applicant had failed to mitigate\nthe Guideline E security concerns. \nApplicant asserts that omissions concerning drug use on security clearance applications\ncompleted by him in 2005 and 2007 were the result of oversight.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not\nestablish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline E is sustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is affirmed.        \nSigned: Michael Y.

For the reasons discussed below, this\ncase is decided for Applicant.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant replied to the SOR allegations as follows: (1) he denied the financial\nconsiderations allegations because the five debts in question had been paid; (2) he\nadmitted the eight allegations of criminal conduct; (3) his answers to the alcohol\nconsumption allegations were mixed; and (4) he denied the two falsification allegations\nand attributed the matter to accidental oversight. Based on the record evidence as a\nwhole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.2\nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is currently\nemployed as a Java developer. He is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance\nfor the first time.  \nIn May 2005, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for Public Trust\nPositions (Standard Form (SF) 85P) as well as a Supplemental Questionnaire for\nSelected Positions (SF 85P\u2013S) (Exhibit 1). The supplemental required him to provide\ninformation about his use of illegal drugs and drug activity. In response to Question\n3a\u2014which asked whether since of age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter,\nhave you illegally used any controlled substance or prescription drugs\u2014Applicant\nresponded in the affirmative. He then listed that he had used marijuana most every day\nfrom October 1997 to June 1998, and had used ecstasy from December 1998 to May\n2002.\nTwo years later in September 2007, Applicant completed a security clearance\napplication (Exhibit 2). It also required him to provide information about his use of illegal\ndrugs and drug activity. In response to Question 24a\u2014which asked whether since of\nage of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance or prescription drugs\u2014Applicant responded in the affirmative. He\nthen listed a single use of marijuana in June 2004 and a single use of ecstasy in\nNovember 2004. In addition, he provided the following comments about his illegal drug\nuse:\nThis is past the 7 year mark but I used to smoke marijuana every day for\nabout 5-6 months my senior year in high school. I have tried ecstasy 6 or\n7 times but only once in the last seven years. I have also tried acid twice\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n3\nand shrooms once longer than 7 years ago. This is the extent of all the\ndrug experimentation I have done (Exhibit 2 at 35, emphasis added).\nAn interview was conducted in October 2007 to discuss Applicant\u2019s financial,\ncriminal, drug, and alcohol-related issues (Exhibit 3). For drugs, the report of the\ninterview is limited to his ecstasy use and it does not discuss marijuana. In the\ninterview, Applicant admitted using ecstasy about six times during the period of\nSeptember 2002 to November 2004, when he was a college student. \nIn March 2008, Applicant replied to the agency\u2019s interrogatories concerning\nalcohol consumption, drugs, criminal conduct, and finances (Exhibit 3). In response to a\nbroad-based question about his use of drugs, Applicant replied as follows: (1) he used\necstasy a total of six times from September 2002 to November 2004; (2) he used\nmarijuana most every day from October 1997 to April 1998; and (3) he used acid and\nmushrooms three times from October 1997 to April 1998. \nIn his hearing testimony, he admitted that he used ecstasy about six times from\nSeptember 2002 to November 2004 (Tr. 51, 54). And he admitted using marijuana in\nJune 2004 (Tr. 51\u201352). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions).  \n4\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n14\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n15\n DC 1 is the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n16\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n5\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n15\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe issues here are the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to questions about\nhis illegal drug use on the supplemental and the security-clearance application. For the\n2005 supplemental, the allegation is that his answer is false because he omitted his\nmarijuana use in June 2004 and his use of ecstasy until November 2004. For the 2007\nsecurity-clearance application, the allegation is that his answer is false because he\nomitted his ecstasy use on six occasions between September 2002 and November\n2004. He contends his incorrect answers were due to accident or oversight. \nHis contentions and explanations are not credible. It is too difficult to believe that\nhis omission of September 2002 to November 2004 ecstasy use was due to accident or\noversight when he completed and signed the supplement in May 2005. Instead, a\nreasonable conclusion is that Applicant deliberately omitted the information by\nunderstating his ecstasy use, because he had to know that the recent use of ecstasy\ncould be a problem. The same goes for his marijuana use in June 2004. Concerning the\n2007 security-clearance application, it is also too difficult to believe that his omission of\nthe full extent of his ecstasy use was due to accident or oversight. Instead, a reasonable\nconclusion is that Applicant deliberately omitted the information by understating his\necstasy use when he reported a single use in November 2004. Indeed, in his additional\ncomments in response to Question 24a, he pointed out that he had use ecstasy once in\nthe last seven years. Yet one month later in the October 2007 interview he reported\nusing ecstasy six times from September 2002 to November 2004. For these reasons,\nthe record evidence supports a conclusion that he deliberately omitted, concealed, or\nfalsified material facts about his use of illegal drugs.   \n16\nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been reviewed and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements to the federal government during the\nsecurity-clearance or similar process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily\nexplained away, extenuated, or mitigated. Applicant\u2019s attempts to reconcile his\ncontradictory statements were not persuasive. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided\nagainst Applicant. \n\n6\nI did not discuss the allegations under Guidelines F, J, and G, because any\nfavorable findings on those allegations will not change the ultimate outcome in light of\nmy adverse findings under Guideline E. In this regard, the principle of judicial economy\nrefers to the practice of a court declining to decide one or more claims in a case on the\ngrounds that it has decided other claims that are sufficient to decide the case and\nsatisfy the parties. Although this is an administrative proceeding and not a court of law,\nthe same logic and reasoning should apply here because addressing the other\nallegations will not change the ultimate outcome, and the law, to include the DoD\nDirective, does not require a futile or pointless act. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E. Applicant did not meet\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching\nthis conclusion, the whole-person concept (to include his favorable character witnesses)\nwas given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision.\nThis case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.a\u20134.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Both coworkers vouched for Applicant\u2019s work performance and suitability for\n6\naccess to classified information. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n7\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n8\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n9\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n10\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n11\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n12\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n13\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n15\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n16\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n17\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n19\n4\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n14\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.15\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.16\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n17\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n18\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n19\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n20\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n21\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n22\n5\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nBoth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions should be analyzed in light of the\nrecord as a whole. The record here shows Applicant has a history of financial problems\nor difficulties as evidenced by the five delinquent debts. Taken together, these\ncircumstances raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment. \nTurning first to the disqualifying conditions under \u00b6 19 of Guideline F, Applicant\u2019s\nhistory of financial difficulties raises concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n20\n21\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish the two\ndisqualifying conditions, and it suggests financial irresponsibility as well.\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six mitigating conditions as follows:  \n22\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 30.\n23\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 21. \n24\n See Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(c),  22(b), 22(c), 22(d), and 22(e). \n25\n See Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31 (d), 23(a), and 23(b).  \n26\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9). \n27\n6\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered, and the most pertinent\nhere is \u00b6 20(d). Applicant mitigated the security concerns based on his good-faith efforts\nto repay his overdue creditors. \nThe criminal conduct and alcohol consumption issues are discussed together\nbecause the record shows that, for the most part, the two are factually related or\nconnected to each other.  Under Guideline J, the overall concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d  Similarly,\n23\nunder Guideline G, the overall concern is that \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often\nleads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d24\nWithout doubt, Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, mostly alcohol-related\nincidents, and his history of excessive alcohol consumption raise security concerns and\njustify application of the pertinent disqualifying conditions under each guideline.  The\n25\nrecord is also clear, however, that Applicant\u2019s last criminal incident took place in\nJanuary 2006, more than three years ago, and that he has abstained from alcohol since\nJanuary 2007, more than two years ago. This passage of time without recurrence is\nevidence of reform and rehabilitation. Given these circumstances, the security concerns\nare mitigated.26\nTo conclude, as discussed in my initial decision, Applicant did not present\nsufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under\nGuideline E based on his false statements. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nnine-factor whole-person concept  was given due consideration. This case is decided\n27\nagainst Applicant. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.h:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.a\u20133.e:\n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.a\u20134.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), which he signed on July 10, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nJuly 15, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nOn December 31, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), which specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed his notarized Answer to the SOR on January 12, \n2009, in which he admitted to all allegations in the Statement of Reasons. He also \nrequested a decision without a hearing. In accordance with \u00b6E3.1.8 of the Directive, the \ngovernment requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on March 17, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on \nMarch 19, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 24, 2009 and I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on April 21, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the Department Counsel offered five exhibits, marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted. Applicant testified and did \nnot present witnesses. He offered three exhibits, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C, \nwhich were admitted. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. He timely submitted one additional document, which was admitted \nwithout objection as AE D. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 28, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations, as well as those in response to the \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 3), are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the \npleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 27 years old, received a bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Management in \n2005. He plans to begin a master\u2019s program within two months after the hearing. He is \nunmarried and has no children. Applicant became employed by a defense contractor in \nMay 2005, where he currently works as a Program Analyst-Junior. He received a \nsecurity clearance in November 2005 (GE 1; 5; Tr. 19). \n \nApplicant first drank alcohol during high school, at about 15 years old, because of \npeer pressure. He first became intoxicated at 16. He consumed alcohol every few \nmonths, and was intoxicated approximately two times during high school. He drank more \nfrequently, about twice per month, after starting college in 2002 (Tr. 29- 34). In August \n2002, he was charged with Possession of Alcohol by a Person under 21. He pled guilty, \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \nwas placed on unsupervised probation for one year3 and performed community service \n(GE 4; Tr. 38-40).  \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant attended a concert with friends, and became \nintoxicated. He was stopped at a sobriety checkpoint after leaving the concert. He failed \nthe field sobriety test and was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated in \nState A. In October 2006, he pled guilty and served 2 days in jail, with the remainder of \nthe 30-day sentence suspended. His State A driving privileges were suspended for one \nyear. He also was ordered to attend alcohol awareness classes, and attended a six-\nweek program from approximately November 2006 to February 2007. The classes \nconsisted of videos and group discussions (GE 2, 3; Tr. 41-44). \n \nIn May 2007, in State B, Applicant had been drinking alcohol, and while driving \nafterward, he reached for a cell phone, and hit a parked car, which then hit the car \nparked in front of it (GE 2). He pulled over and notified residents of a nearby house, who \ncontacted the police. He was charged with negligent driving, driving while under the \ninfluence of alcohol, driving while under the influence-per se, and driving while impaired \nby alcohol. He reported his alcohol-related arrests to his security officer. Three of the \ncharges were not prosecuted, and Applicant pleaded guilty to Driving a Vehicle while \nUnder the Influence of Alcohol. He was sentenced to 90 days incarceration, with 81 days \nsuspended. Applicant spent six days in jail, with two days credited for good behavior. He \nwas also sentenced to three years unsupervised probation, which ends in 2010. The \nunsupervised probation does not include a prohibition against consuming alcohol. \nApplicant\u2019s sentence included a 90 day-restriction on his driving license, but because he \nneeded to be able to drive to his job, he chose to install a vehicle interlock system on his \ncar for one year. The system prevents starting the car until the driver blows into a device \nthat checks the driver\u2019s alcohol level. A reading of more than 0.01 prevents operating the \ncar. The device also requires a periodic re-check while driving. Applicant completed the \none-year period of vehicle interlock monitoring in about August 2008. (GE 2; 4; 5; Tr. 44-\n50). \n \nBefore the final disposition of the 2007 case, and before consulting with an \nattorney, Applicant decided to enroll in alcohol treatment (Tr. 46-47). His decision \nresulted from discussions with his parents, who informed him that his maternal \ngrandfather had died because of his excessive alcohol consumption. Applicant does not \nwant the same thing to happen to him (GE 2). He also recognized that he needed help:  \n \nAt that time I didn\u2019t think I had an alcohol problem before the second DUI, \nand for me to get behind the wheel a second time, I needed some kind of \nmentoring or help to help me not do that ever again. (Tr. 47). \n \nHe participated in a 26-week treatment program that included random urinalyses, \nbreathalyzer testing, alcohol and chemical dependency screening, and group sessions, \nbut did not involve aftercare requirements. He also arrived 30 minutes before group \n3\n                                                 \n3 Applicant testified that he thought this probation ended when he reached 21 years old, which would \nhave been in February 2003, 6 months after the incident (Tr. 39). \n \n\n \nsessions so that he could engage in individual counseling (Tr. 61). He was diagnosed \nwith alcohol abuse. Applicant attended from July 2007 to January 2008 (AE A; D).  \n \nSince Applicant's second DUI, Applicant consumed alcohol twice: he had \napproximately four beers in July 2007, before he attended counseling. He also had two \nglasses of wine at his brother\u2019s wedding in May 2008 (Tr. 33-35). He has never \nexperienced blackouts, hallucinations or other withdrawal symptoms (Tr. 65). He admits \nthat excessive alcohol affects his judgment, and his intent is to avoid driving at any time \nhe has had alcohol, and to abstain from alcohol except for such important occasions. He \ntalks with his friends about avoiding drinking and driving, sharing what he has \nexperienced, the problems that resulted, and the thousands of dollars it has cost him in \nlegal fees, court costs, and loss of work time. He volunteers to pick up his friends when \nthey drink so they do not have to drive. His girlfriend does not drink alcohol. Applicant \ntestified that when he drank, he was not involved in outside activities, but he now \nvolunteers as a coach, working at least five days per week with a church softball team \nand a winter softball team (GE 2; Tr. 21; 50-51; 57-59; 63). \n \nApplicant's performance review of January to December 2008 indicates that he is \na hard worker who has grown in his position, taken on new responsibilities, and \nsuccessfully managed contracts. His supervisor of more than three years noted that \nApplicant is dependable and, during the time she has supervised him, he has become a \nteam leader who is a significant company asset (AE B; C).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nthe cited guideline.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \n4\n                                                 \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to \ndeny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must \nbe able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its \nburden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). \n \nAG \u00b6 22 includes the following relevant conditions that can raise security \nconcerns and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program; \n \n5\n                                                 \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \nApplicant was charged with possessing alcohol when he was under-age, and \nwith DUI in 2006 and 2007. These incidents support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and \n22(c). Moreover, AG \u00b6 22(e) applies in part, because he was evaluated as an alcohol \nabuser. However, the evaluation was provided by a professional who is not a clinical \nsocial worker, but holds a master\u2019s degree in clinical alcohol and drug counseling.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that can mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics \nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \nApplicant had two DUI convictions within a short period of time. They occurred in \n2006 and 2007, between two and almost three years ago. The second DUI brought \nApplicant to the realization that he must change his behavior, and his subsequent \nactions in attending a four-month program on his own initiative, along with his modified \nalcohol consumption over the past two years, reflect favorably on his good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) applies.    \n \nAfter his second DUI in a short period of time, Applicant has acknowledged that \nhe had a problem with alcohol consumption. He reported his arrests to his security \nofficer. He discussed the issue with his parents, and learned of a disturbing family \nhistory related to alcohol. Applicant entered a 26-week treatment program before the \ncourt required him to do so, and before an attorney advised him to do so. He has \nestablished a responsible pattern of alcohol consumption by drinking only twice in the \npast two years. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed the counseling program he voluntarily entered, \nand his two uses of alcohol in two years represent responsible modified consumption \n6\n \n\n \nconsistent with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. Applicant has also received a favorable \nreport, though not a prognosis. In addition, he cannot receive complete mitigation \nbecause the counselor who evaluated him is not a licensed clinical social worker. \nApplicant\u2019s actions also earn partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 23(d). I find for Applicant on \nGuideline G. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant made serious missteps by increasing his alcohol consumption after \ncollege. His choices led to two DUIs in a short period of time. Fortunately, several \nevents brought him to realize the gravity of his situation: the second DUI, learning of his \ngrandfather\u2019s alcohol use and death, as well as his parents\u2019 advice. On his own \ninitiative, Applicant sought and participated in a 26-week treatment program. Although \nhe was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser, and is not required to be abstinent, he has \nconsumed alcohol only twice in the past two years, showing serious commitment to \navoiding the mistakes of the past. His honesty with his security officer demonstrates \ntrustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s conduct in the future is unlikely to raise alcohol-related \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \n \n \n7\n \n\n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.d. \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Michael Lyles, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated December 18, 2007.  On October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 28, 2008, in which\nshe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on December 9, 2008.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on January 6, 2009, and she submitted a reply within the required time frame.\nThe case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on February 18, 2009, and was\nassigned to this Administrative Judge for resolution on March 16, 2009.\n\n  The SOR erroneously alleges that the filing date of the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy was August 16, 1999.  Government\n1\nExhibit 6, a copy of the Bankruptcy petition, indicates that the actual filing date was October 4, 1999.  I have\namended the SOR to comport with the evidence.    \n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 46 years old.  She is employed by a\ndefense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe SOR alleges fourteen delinquent debts totaling approximately $15,319.00.\nApplicant admits all of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except allegations 1(c), 1(d),\nand 1(e).  Credit reports of the Applicant dated December 2, 2008, and December 17,\n2007, indicate that she remains indebted to each of the creditors and that either they\nwere in collection status or were charged off.  (Government Exhibits 8 and 9).  \nOn October 4, 1999, the Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy.   At the time,\n1\nher assets totaled $8,000.00 while her liabilities totaled $7,120.00.  On January 19,\n2000, her unsecured debts were discharged.  (Government Exhibit 6).\nBetween 2002 and 2008, the Applicant opened numerous credit card accounts,\nautomobile loans, utility, medical bills, convenience and other miscellaneous accounts\nthat she could not afford to pay.  She attributes her financial problems to several\ndifferent events.  She lost her job and was unemployed from May 2002 to November\n2002.  Her husband was not working at times, and when he was, his work hours were\nreduced.  Her husband\u2019s habit of moving in and out of the house caused problems and\nhe eventually deserted the family in 2004.  She also claims that her son was in a car\naccident and her insurance would not pay the medical bills.  Applicant submitted no\ndocumentary evidence to support these assertions.  (Government Exhibit 5).    \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, she states that she is currently working on\nreducing her delinquent debt.  She plans on paying each of her delinquent debts one by\none, however she does not want to overextend herself or make arrangements with\ncreditors to pay amounts that she cannot afford.  Presently, she states that she has paid\n\n3\noff two of her debts and is working on paying another.  A debt owed to NCO\nFinancial/Florida Power in the amount of $265.00 has been paid, and a debt to Credit\nManagement (CMI) Bright House in the amount of $349.00 has also been settled.  She\nalso claims that a judgment entered against her in September 2004, in the amount of\n$3,393.00 has been satisfied.  However, she has  provided no proof or payment or any\nother documentation to support her assertions.\nEven assuming that she has paid three of the debts, eleven others remain\noutstanding.  She remains indebted in excess of $8,000.00.  A debt owed to NCO\nFinancial in the amount of $265.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to HSBC in the\namount of $265.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed for a medical account in the\namount of $136.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed for a medical account in the\namount of $451.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed for a medical account in the\namount of $367.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Capital One in the amount of\n$2,151.00 remains outstanding.  A debt owed to Capital One in the amount of $2,186.00\nremains outstanding.  A debt owed to Midland in the amount of $3,439.00 remains\noutstanding.  A debt owed to Portfolio in the amount of $1,353.00 remains outstanding.\nA debt owed to AFNI Bloom in the amount of $555.00 remains outstanding.  A debt\nowed to First Premier in the amount of $409.00 remains outstanding.  (Government\nExhibits 8 and 9).   \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement dated September 5, 2008, indicates that\nafter she pays her regular monthly expenses, and her son\u2019s college rent of $500.00, she\nhas $133.76 left at the end of the month.  This does not allow her to pay much toward\nher delinquent debts.  At the bottom of the statement she remarks, \u201c$500.00 from\ndaughter and $300 bi-weekly from husband\u201d, but there is no documentary evidence to\nsubstantiate this additional income or what she has planned to do with it if she does\nreceive it.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic\nplan to pay the debt;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\n\n5\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant\u2019s seven month period of unemployment, her husband\u2019s reduced\nwork hours, and his absence from the family household, obviously contributed to her\nfinancial delinquencies.  However, the record also shows that in 1999, she filed Chapter\n7 Bankruptcy and discharged all of her delinquent debts.  She then went out, opened up\nnew credit accounts, and again fell delinquent.  The Applicant has not shown that the\nconditions that caused her financial problems were largely beyond her control.  She\nhas, however, shown a clear pattern of financial irresponsibility.  Although she states\nthat she has recently paid off three of her debts, she remains indebted in the amount of\nat least $8,000.00.  \nShe states that she plans to pay her debts but does not present a budget or\npayment plan to explain how her delinquent debts will be paid.  Furthermore, it is\n\n6\nunclear from the record whether she understands the importance of financial\nmanagement.  A promise to take remedial measures in the future is not evidence of\nreform and rehabilitation.  There is no evidence in the record that she has eliminated\nher use of credit cards.  There is no evidence in the record to demonstrate that she can\nmake her regular monthly payments in addition to making payments on her delinquent\ndebts.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  \nWith respect to her finances, assuming she has paid three of her delinquent\ndebts, she remains indebted to at least eleven separate creditors totaling approximately\n$8,000.00.  She has just started the financial rehabilitation process and has a long way\nto go before her delinquent debts are resolved.  At the present time, she has not\npresented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or\nthat she has resolved her financial indebtedness.\nUpon review of her financial statement, it appears that she has little disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay her past due bills.  There is little evidence of\nfinancial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nDisqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19(b)\nindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any\nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions apply.  Her financial problems remain current and they are not\nisolated.  The Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay her overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve her debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.g; and he denied responsibility for SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, and 1.h (GE 9). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Since January 2008, he has provided instructor services to soldiers on a military installation about how to use various simulators (Tr. 36). Applicant has never been married (Tr. 47). Applicant attended the U.S. Army Military Academy Preparatory School (USAMAPS) and then the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York (USMA) (Tr. 18; AE A). When Applicant was a senior at USMA, he suffered a head injury while playing Rugby for USMA and was medically separated from Army service on May 24, 2004 (Tr. 19, 45; AE A). Applicant suffered from a depressive-mood disorder as a result of his head injury (AE A). However, he did not receive a military medical retirement (Tr. 30). He received a Veterans Affairs disability rating of 60%, which pays $974 a month (Tr. 30-31). He does not receive any other disability payments (Tr. 31). After Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Army, he worked as a security supervisor (Tr. 23-24). In 2006-2007, he returned to school because he needed about 30 credits to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 23-24).

After he received his current employment, he demonstrated a meaningful track \nrecord of debt repayment. He mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nAccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 1, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 16, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the \nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed \nJune 22, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn November 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non December 2, 2008. On February 12, 2009, the case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge. Applicant requested a delay and the case was transferred to me \non March 10, 2009. On April 1, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was \nheld on April 21, 2009. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits (GE 1-\n4) (Transcript (Tr.) 11-12), and Applicant offered five exhibits (AE A-E) (Tr. 13-17). \nThere were no objections, and I admitted GEs 1-4 (Tr. 12-13), and AE A-E (Tr. 17). \nAdditionally, I admitted the Second Notice of Hearing, Notice of Cancellation of Hearing, \nFirst Notice of Hearing, SOR, and response to the SOR (GEs 5-9). I received the \ntranscript on April 29, 2009. I held the record open until May 22, 2009, to provide \nApplicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence (Tr. 50-51, 58). However, he did \nnot provide any post-hearing evidence.    \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d to 1.g; and he denied responsibility for SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c, and 1.h (GE 9). \nHis admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Since January \n2008, he has provided instructor services to soldiers on a military installation about how \nto use various simulators (Tr. 36). Applicant has never been married (Tr. 47). \n \nApplicant attended the U.S. Army Military Academy Preparatory School \n(USAMAPS) and then the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York (USMA) (Tr. \n18; AE A). When Applicant was a senior at USMA, he suffered a head injury while \nplaying Rugby for USMA and was medically separated from Army service on May 24, \n2004 (Tr. 19, 45; AE A). Applicant suffered from a depressive-mood disorder as a result \nof his head injury (AE A). However, he did not receive a military medical retirement (Tr. \n30). He received a Veterans Affairs disability rating of 60%, which pays $974 a month \n(Tr. 30-31). He does not receive any other disability payments (Tr. 31). \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Army, he worked as a security supervisor \n(Tr. 23-24). In 2006-2007, he returned to school because he needed about 30 credits to \nobtain his bachelor\u2019s degree (Tr. 23-24). However, he was unable to complete \nrequirements and obtain a degree because of issues of depression and difficulty \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nconcentrating (Tr. 24, 35). He would like to return to college on a part-time basis and \ncomplete his degree (Tr. 35).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant served on active duty as an enlisted soldier for two years, including one \nyear at USAMAPS (Tr. 22). He received a small salary for four years while he attended \nUSMA (Tr. 22). After Applicant was discharged from the Army, his income was low (Tr. \n19). His social security records show the following income (does not include disability \npayments from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)) for the years 2004 to 2007: \n2004-$8,387; 2005-$13,710; 2006-$5,736; and 2007-$2,886 (AE B).  \n \nApplicant borrowed money while he was a USMA cadet (Tr. 20). His largest loan \nwas known as a \u201cCareer Starter Loan\u201d for $25,000, which was provided to USMA \ncadets by a large bank as they approach graduation (Tr. 20; SOR \u00b6 1.f). He borrowed \nfor uniforms and to purchase a car (Tr. 21-22). The source, status, and amount of his \nindividual SOR debts are more specifically described as follows (paragraph letters \ncorrespond with the SOR subparagraphs): \n  \n(a) Debt for $942 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He denied responsibility for this debt (Tr. 27); \n \n(b) Debt for $125 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He denied responsibility for this debt (Tr. 27); \n \n(c) Debt for $144 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He denied responsibility for this debt (Tr. 27); \n \n(d) Credit card debt for $4,058 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant has not paid anything on \nthis debt (Tr. 37-38). The creditor declined to allow a payment plan, and Applicant is \nsaving money to pay this debt with a lump sum payment on September 1, 2009 (Tr. 28-\n29, 38); \n \n(e) Credit card debt for $1,320 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant has not paid anything on \nthis debt (Tr. 37-38). The creditor declined to allow a payment plan, and Applicant has \nsaved enough money to pay this debt with a single payment on June 1, 2009 (Tr. 28-29, \n38);  \n \n(f) Credit card debt for $24,174 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He said he had been making \npayments for a longer period than he had documentary evidence showing such \npayments (Tr. 37). He provided proof of payments on the following dates in the listed \namounts: January 31, 2009 for $125; February 28, 2009 for $125; and March 31, 2009 \nfor $150 (Tr. 36; AE E); \n \n(g) Debt for $536 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He made a payment of February 28, 2009 to \nsettle and pay this debt for $412 (Tr. 25-26, 36; AE D);   \n \n(h) Debt for $612 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant denied owing this debt (Tr. 27). He \nprovided a cancelled check to the creditor to corroborate that he had paid the creditor \n\n \n \n4 \n \n(Tr. 27, 41). However, he did not retain the documentation, and so he said he would pay \nthe debt again (Tr. 42-45). \n \nApplicant denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c (Tr. 27). He investigated these \nthree debts, and all he was able to discover was that the debts pertained to medical \nservices (Tr. 27). He received all medical assistance from Army and VA hospitals (Tr. \n31-32). The creditors were not able to provide sufficient information for Applicant to \nverify the authenticity of or his responsibility for the three debts (Tr. 27).  \n \nApplicant borrowed $3,000 from his aunt to repair his vehicle and he needed to \nmake payments to her (Tr. 39). He paid that debt and is making payments on his other \ndebts (Tr. 39). Applicant does not have any other credit cards (Tr. 40). \n \nApplicant promised to repay his creditors and emphasized he had proven his \nintention to make restitution to his creditors (Tr. 24-25, 57). He made three payments \ntotaling $500 on a non-SOR-listed student loan of $1,175 to bring it to current status: \nFebruary 2, 2009 for $200; February 22, 2009 for $200; and March 1, 2009 for $100 (Tr. \n25, 33; AE C). He now pays $60 monthly on this debt using an automatic allotment (Tr. \n25). The student loan resulted from his college attendance in 2006 to 2007 (Tr. 32).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross pay (including his disability pay) is about $3,800 monthly (Tr. \n40-41; GE 2). His monthly deductions are $692 and his monthly expenses are $1,375 \n(GE 2). His personal financial statement shows monthly payments of $200 for a student \nloan, $220 for a personal loan, $125 for a commercial bank loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $100 \nfor another student loan (GE 2). He has about $1,000 monthly remaining to address his \nother SOR debts (Tr. 40-41). Applicant has about $650 in his savings account (Tr. 38). \nHe has about $2,000 in his 401K plan (Tr. 38). His vehicle, a 1996 Lexus, is paid off (Tr. \n38-39).   \n \nApplicant has always been honest about his financial problems. When Applicant \nsubmitted his SF-86 on February 1, 2008, he provided a list of debts that were \ndelinquent in the last seven years for more than 180 days (GE 1). He did not receive \nany credit counseling (Tr. 41). \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n\n \n \n5 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \n\n \n \n6 \n \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and, \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his SF 86, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse and at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were paid as agreed. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further \ninquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n   \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(e) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nApplicant receives full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted because of his injury at USMA and his subsequent unemployment and \nunderemployment. He receives substantial mitigating credit because his delinquent \ndebts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He established that \nhe paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g and has been making payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nHe has a plan to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e with a single lump sum payment, \nand those two debts should be resolved by September 1, 2009.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling and \ntherefore this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. However, there are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d for the reasons stated \nin the preceding paragraph. He understands the security implications of delinquent debt \nand will scrupulously avoid future delinquent debt. He has also established some, but \nnot full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed substantial good faith2 in the \nresolution of his SOR debts.    \n \nApplicant contests the validity of the remaining four debts, which total less than \n$2,000. However, he did not provide documentation contesting these four debts. He \ncredibly promised to pay these four debts if he could establish their validity. His overall \nconduct over the last 17 months with his creditors shows he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.3 AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because he did not provide corroborating \ndocumentation showing his disputes of any of his SOR debts. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. Nevertheless, he established the full applicability \nof AG \u00b6 20(b). Moreover, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \u201cWhole Person \nConcept,\u201d infra at pages 8-10.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial conduct. Several of \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent years ago. In January 2008, he began his present \nemployment; however, he should have made greater progress on his debts because he \nhas about $1,000 monthly remaining after deductions, expenses and debt payments. He \nadmitted responsibility for four delinquent SOR debts. He failed to obtain financial \ncounselling. He showed some effort in 2008 and 2009 to resolve his delinquent debts, \nbut could have acted more aggressively to pay his delinquent debts, to seek debt \nrepayment or resolution, and to better document his remedial efforts. These factors \nshow some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt \nraises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. He is a law-abiding citizen. His current \nfinancial problems were caused by three factors beyond his control: (1) his injury, (2) \n \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n \n9 \n \nunemployment, and (3) underemployment. He paid one SOR debt. He is making \npayments on his largest SOR debt. He has a plan to pay two other SOR debts by \nSeptember 1, 2009. He is making payments on his non-SOR student loan. He paid off a \nnon-SOR, personal loan for $3,000. He has ample income to pay his debts. The Appeal \nBoard has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial cases \nstating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nAlthough Applicant is only 31 years old, he has achieved some important \neducational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and \ndedication. He served on active duty for six years, including almost four years at USMA. \nIn 2004, he received a brain injury, which dramatically changed his prospects for \nfinancial security, and his debts became delinquent. His severe injury was in the line of \nduty, and he is receiving 60% disability from the VA. He obtained employment in \nJanuary 2008 with a government contractor, and he is continuing to support the Army. \nHe understands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial \nresponsibility. Clearly, he could have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts, after \nreceiving employment with a government contractor. There is, however, simply no \nreason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments by paying one SOR debt, making payments on his largest SOR debt, \nand making payments on his student loan. He has a plan to pay two SOR debts by \nSeptember 1, 2009 with a lump sum payment to each creditor. The four remaining, \nunaddressed SOR debts are of questionable validity and total less than $2,000; \nnevertheless, he has promised to pay them if he can establish they are valid debts. I \nfound his statement to be candid, forthright and credible. Applicant has demonstrated \nhis loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service to the Department of \n\n \n \n10 \n \nDefense as a contractor and to the U.S. Army. These factors, especially his past \ngovernment service, show sufficient responsibility and rehabilitation to mitigate security \nconcerns.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.h: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national\n1\ninterest to allow Applicant access to classified information. On October 10, 2008, DOHA\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security\nMarch 30, 2009\n\n The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n As provided for by section E3.1.10, I excluded Gx. 3 and 4, because they did not meet the authentication\n3\nrequirements of Directive Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. (Tr. 18 - 22)\n Applicant testified that he was unemployed for about a year (Tr. 40); however, the SF 86 (Gx. 1) and\n4\nSummary of Interview (Gx. 2) show he was unemployed for between three and six months.\n2\nconcerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F\n2\n(financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 2, 2009, and I convened a hearing on February 25, 2009.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 -\n5).  Applicant testified and submitted three exhibits (Ax. A - C), which were admitted\n3\nwithout objection. I left the record open after the hearing (Tr. 56 - 57) to allow Applicant\nto present additional relevant information. On March 3, 2009, I received his post-hearing\nsubmission, which has been included in the record without objection as Ax. D. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on March 4, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $43,104\nfor 17 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.q). Applicant admitted all of the SOR\nallegations, except for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n, 1.o and 1.q. The basis for his\ndenials is that he does not recognize the accounts as his. (Tr. 30 - 31) In addition to the\nfacts entered through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I have made the following findings of\nrelevant fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since\nJanuary 2005. From May 1995 until November 2004, he worked as a mechanic for a\nlarge food processing and distribution corporation. However, the plant where he worked\nclosed and he was laid off. He was hired by his current employer after three to six\nmonths  of unemployment and working odd jobs. Applicant spends most of his time\n4\naway from home as part of a team that installs security systems at military bases and\nother federal facilities. He is paid per diem for meals and incidentals, and he is\nreimbursed for his travel and lodging expenses. (Tr. 45 - 47) \nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage began in September 1986\nand ended through divorce in July 1995. Applicant has been paying child support of\n$600 each month since the divorce, but this obligation will end in about May 2009. He\nmarried his current wife in May 2007. (Gx. 1) She recently lost her job at a printing\ncompany and now works part-time as a babysitter. She currently brings home about\n$500 each month. When Applicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) in\nSeptember 2008, her monthly income was about $800. Applicant estimates that he and\nhis wife have about $250 remaining each month after expenses, which does not include\n\n This debt has grown through interest and fees from $6,176 at the close of Applicant\u2019s background\n5\ninvestigation.\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n3\npayment to any of the debts listed in the SOR. Their monthly expenses include making\nminimum payments on four credit cards in his wife\u2019s name which have a current total\nbalance of about $14,000. Applicant insists these accounts are current and that the high\nbalances were incurred when his wife had to recover from Hurricane Katrina. (Tr. 33 -\n39; Gx. 2) \nApplicant claimed to have had good credit and to have been current on his debts\nthrough the time he was laid off in 2004. (Tr. 29 - 30). However, he also acknowledged\nbeing financially overextended before he lost his job. Indeed, some of the debts listed in\nthe SOR became delinquent before he was unemployed. (Tr. 41 - 42, 48 - 52) Applicant\nmade about $38,000 annually in his previous job. He now makes between $60,000 and\n$65,000 annually. He has not paid or otherwise resolved any of the debts listed in the\nSOR, but he estimates he has about $25,000 in a 401(k) retirement account. He is\nwilling to use his 401(k) funds to pay down his delinquent debts. (Tr. 39 - 52) One of\nApplicant\u2019s creditors (SOR \u00b6 1.c) has offered to settle a $10,392  delinquency for\n5\n$3,088.33 or $6,176.65 depending on which payment option he chooses. (Ax. A)\nApplicant intends to accept the offer but has not shown that he has, in fact, acted on it. \nApplicant has a good reputation at work. He now serves as a crew leader and is\nwell regarded for his work ethics and time management. (Ax. B) His project manager\nand a government customer have praised his reliability, trustworthiness and discretion\nin handling sensitive information. (Ax. C and D)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,6\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n4\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n8\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.9\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the SOR\nallegations. Applicant has incurred a significant amount of delinquent debt since at least\n2004. He was overextended before losing his job in 2004 and some of the debts listed\nwere already delinquent or well past due when he became unemployed. Further, since\nJanuary 2005, he has been earning roughly 40% more each year than he did before he\n\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n5\nwas laid off. He took no action to pay or resolve his delinquencies during the more than\ntwo years before he re-married. His previous delinquencies are still unresolved because\nhe is helping to pay off $14,000 of credit card debt in his wife\u2019s name. The foregoing\nrequires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), AG \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant has not presented information that would support\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20. His financial problems are\nrecent, in that they remain unresolved. While his relatively brief period of unemployment\nmay have exacerbated his credit problems, it did not cause them. Further, he has had\nmore than three years in which to use his increased income to pay at least some of his\ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.I, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.q list debts of less than $200 each). Applicant has\nnot shown how or that he will resolve his past delinquencies while repaying his wife\u2019s\ncurrent high credit card balances. Accordingly, he has failed to mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s adverse information about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 42 years old and\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. He has been successful in his current job\nand he is well-regarded by his supervisors and by his government customers. However,\nhis inaction regarding his past debts and his current obligation to his wife\u2019s debts make\nit unlikely his finances will improve in the near future. In sum, available positive\ninformation about Applicant\u2019s job performance is insufficient for me to conclude that he\nhas satisfied the doubts about his suitability for a clearance raised by the government\u2019s\ninformation about his finances. Because protection of the national interest is paramount\nin these determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 26, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 7, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on September\n15, 2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date.  At the hearing, the government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on four witnesses (including himself)\nFebruary 22, 2010\n\n2\nand 11 exhibits.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 25, 2009.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access\nclassified information is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his receipt of chips from Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\ncommemorating his adherence to sobriety and a follow-up letter from his substance\nabuse counselor. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement\nthe record. Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with\ndocumented chips from his AA chapter and an updated letter from his substance abuse\ncounselor.  His  post-hearing exhibits were admitted as exhibits L and M.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have (a) received alcohol abuse\ncounseling from an identified alcohol abuse counselor between July and August 2005;\n(b) received inpatient treatment for depression and alcohol dependence from an inpatient\nhospital between July 2 and 3, 2003; (c) been arrested in August 1991 for driving under\nthe influence (DUI), and (d) consumed alcohol as recent as August 2008.  \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations covered by\nGuideline G.  He added no explanations or affirmative defenses to his answer.\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 46-year old specialty engineer manager for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. Because Applicant denied every allegation in the SOR, all\nrelevant and material findings are subject to proof requirements.\nApplicant married his first and only spouse in August 1995.  He separated from\nhis spouse in 1996 and divorced her in September 1997 (see ex. 1).  Applicant has no\nchildren from this marriage  (see ex. 1).  He has two siblings (a brother and sister).\nApplicant has a bachelor of science degree in chemistry and is a chemist by\nvocation.  He began working for his current employer in November 2005 (see ex. 2; Tr.\n67).  \nAt the age of 21, while still in college, Applicant was introduced to alcohol.  He\nstarted with beer but changed to whiskey after a short time (ex. 2).  By July 2003,\nApplicant was regularly consuming 11 ounces of whiskey a day (ex. 2). Aware of\nalcoholism in his family (both parents), he struggled to control his drinking.  Concerned\nenough about how his drinking could potentially affect his job, he self-referred himself to\nan inpatient hospital (IH) in July 2003 (see ex. 2).  \n\n3\nBetween 1987 and 2003, he was an excessive consumer of alcohol (ex. 2).  He\nwas arrested and charged with a DUI offense in August 1991.  At the scene, he was\nadministered a field sobriety test and registered a .08 percent blood alcohol level (BAC).\nTypically, he initiated his drinking episodes with beer, but switched to whiskey and then\nto gin consumption after a short time (ex. 2).  During this period, he consumed alcohol\nthree to four times a week.  Over the course of a typical week, he consumed two bottles\n(Tr. 81-82).  He often drank to mitigate the effects of his depression problem (see ex. 2).\nConcerned about his drinking (mostly by himself) and the potential effects it could\nhave upon his job (such as missing work), Applicant self-referred himself in July 2003 to\nIH\u2019s inpatient unit in a severely intoxicated state (see ex. 2; Tr. 77, 80-81, 90).  His July\n2003 admission records described him as a 40-year old process manager of a major\naerospace firm who was admitted to the hospital\u2019s inpatient unit for alcohol detoxification\n(ex. 2).  Hospital records document that once admitted, he \u201cquickly started showing signs\nof acute withdrawal\u201d (see ex. 2).  His admission records indicate he was  diagnosed with\n(1) ethanol withdrawal, major depression, and alcohol dependency, all on the Axis scale\nof the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (the DSM) (Ivth ed. 2004). His admission intake\nsummary, in turn, described him as profoundly depressed (ex. 2).  His IH medical team\nstarted him on Zoloft to address his depression symptoms, along with other anti-\ndepressants.  He was administered Depakote to prevent acute withdrawal symptoms.  \nAfter 72 hours of treatment, Applicant displayed marked improvements in\nfunctioning and resolution of his depression symptoms (see ex. 2).  He was discharged\nfour days after his admission with an unchanged diagnosis.\nAfter completing the inpatient program, Applicant adhered to a regiment of self-\nimposed abstinence for about 11 months before he returned to alcohol consumption (Tr.\n73, 82-83).  During this time, he attended AA meetings three to four times a week without\nthe support of a sponsor (Tr. 72-73).  Gin continued to be his drink of choice on\nweekdays and on weekends (Tr. 84). And by 2005, he had progressed to consuming two\nfifths of gin a week, and maintained this level of alcohol consumption for about seven\nmonths (Tr. 84, 108-09).  \nBy July 2005, Applicant realized he needed help and asked his employee\u2019s\nassistance program for professional references (Tr. 70).  He checked himself into AC\u2019s\noutpatient counseling program. The program consisted of twice-weekly counseling\nsessions and encouraged abstinence (Tr. 70). He is certain she diagnosed him as\nalcoholic (Tr. 71).  Despite her diagnosis, Applicant continued to drink occasionally (viz.,\none large glass of gin a week) during his four months of enrollment in her program, a\npractice he continued for several years after he completed her program in October 2005\n(Tr.84 -86, 95).  During this time, he never attended AA sessions (Tr. 95),\nApplicant resumed his attending AA meetings in September 2008, and has not\nconsumed alcohol since August 2008 (Tr. 76-77, 100).  He has a sponsor and regularly\nattends AA meetings two to three times a week (Tr. 74). He regularly works the 12 steps\nof the \u201cBig Book\u201d and exchanges stories of his alcohol experiences with other members\n\n4\nof his AA chapter (Tr. 74). Applicant documents his receipt of two AA chips that\ncommemorate his sustained abstinence since September 2008 (see ex. M; Tr. 76-77,\n100).  \nBeginning in October 2008, Applicant initiated consultations with a different\nlicensed substance abuse counselor (see exs. J and L; Tr. 88-90). He met with this\ncounselor (Dr. PD) for a second time in July 2009 (ex. J).  In both sessions with\nApplicant, Dr. PD (a licensed clinical psychologist) took some background history from\nApplicant (ex. J) and noted his prior bouts of depression, his family alcohol history, and\nhis active involvement in AA. Dr. PD assigned Applicant a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence in early remission and recommended he continue with his AA program (ex.\nJ).  In a follow-up session two months later, Dr. PD noted Applicant\u2019s progress since his\ninitial session and upgraded his diagnosis to alcohol dependence, in early full remission\n(see ex. L.). Dr. PD\u2019s upgraded diagnosis indicates a much more positive diagnosis for\nApplicant.  Applicant, for himself, assures he will continue to attend AA meetings two to\nthree times a week, maintain his sobriety, and adhere to the prescribed\nrecommendations of his AA sponsor and treatment counselors (Tr. 76).  \nEndorsements\nApplicant is highly regarded by his colleagues and coworkers (see exs. A through\nF). They characterize him as loyal, responsible, and trustworthy (exs. A through F).\nNone of his references ever saw him abuse alcohol in their presence (Tr. 27, 45, 49; 56-\n57, and 62).  None of these colleagues expressed any awareness of his completing\nalcohol detoxification and counseling programs before the initiation of this hearing\nprocess (Tr. 31-32, 45, 62-64, and 84).  His direct supervisor credits him  with a strong\nwork ethic (Tr. 59). Applicant documents solid outstanding performance evaluations for\nthe past three years (see ex. K) and is generally considered a high value contributor to\nhis engineering team. \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations\nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the \"[c]onditions\nthat could mitigate security concerns,\u201d if any. These guidelines must be considered\nbefore deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or\ndenied.  Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the\nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a\ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs,\n\n5\nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense\ndecision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context\nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period\nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the\napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct: (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent herein:\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nSee AG \u00b6 21.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the revised AGs, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 (1988).  As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\n\n6\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances be\nclearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n531 (1988). \nThe administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant or deny a clearance is not a final\ndecision unless the parties choose not to appeal.  See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 to E3.3.39.\nDOHA\u2019s Appeal Board may reverse the administrative judge\u2019s \u201cdecision to grant, deny,\nor revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  ISCR Case\nNo. 07-16511 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing \u00b6 E1.32.3).  Appeal boards and federal\ncourts review the administrative judge\u2019s factual determinations to ensure they are\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record, and regularly defer to the administrative\njudge\u2019s credibility determinations and inferences from the evidence.  See, e.g., See v.\nWashington Metro Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 382 (4  Cir. 1994).  See also ISCR\nth\nCase No. 09-03773 at 7-8 n. 5-7 (App. Bd. Jan. 29, 2010) (explaining appellate remedies\nwhen hearing-level judges err).\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly-regarded employee of a defense contractor with a history of\ndrinking abuses and diagnosed alcohol dependence. Applicant\u2019s exhibited alcohol abuse\nraises security concerns covered by Guideline G of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  \nApplicant\u2019s extended history of alcohol abuse over a 15-year period, as well as his\nmultiple treatment referrals for detoxification (2003) and management of his alcohol\ndependence issues (2005), raise major concerns over his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.\nOn the strength of the evidence presented, three disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nAdjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption (AG \u00b6 21) may be applied: 22(a),\n\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent,\u201d \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u00b6 22(d), diagnosis by a duly-qualified medical professional (e.g.,\nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d\nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he detected warning signs of his drinking abuses and sought\nprofessional treatment. He returned to light to moderate drinking, though, after being\ngiven a dependence diagnosis at in July 2003.  He resumed his alcohol consumption as\n\n7\nwell following several months of alcohol counseling between July and October 2005, and\ncontinued his occasional consumption of alcohol until August 2008 before quitting\naltogether.\nWhen faced with recurrent alcohol-related arrests over a considerable period of\ntime, and the absence of any sustained abstinence, the Appeal Board has expressed\nreluctance to make safe, predictive judgments about an applicant\u2019s ability to avoid\nabusive incidents in the future without strong probative evidence of sustained recovery,\naided by positive professional reinforcements.  See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 (App. Bd.\nJan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007); ISCR Case No. 05-\n16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007). However, these cases stand in marked contrast to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.\n The facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case are quite different from the\npatterns in the cited ISCR cases above.  Applicant has not been involved in any alcohol-\nrelated incident since 1991, and has consistently sought professional assistance when\nhe had concerns about returning to abusive drinking.  He has demonstrated considerable\nresponsibility in dealing with his alcohol problem.\nTrue, family history, a prior DUI incident, and  multiple treatment admissions have\nhampered Applicant\u2019s ability to establish a long-term recovery regimen. His only DUI is\nquite aged, however, and he has had no alcohol-related incidents of any kind since his\nlone 1991 DUI offense.  Even more important are the series of voluntary corrective steps\nhe has taken to address his drinking when it became apparent to him that alcohol was\nposing a problem for him.  Applicant has continued to seek professional help to identify\nand mitigate his drinking excesses, and continues to receive counseling today. He has\nestablished a strong 12-step AA program, and with the aid of the network support it\nprovides, he has been able to sustain his self-imposed abstinence for over a year.  He\nhas an earned one-year chip from his AA chapter to commemorate his efforts. His efforts\nhave prompted his current substance abuse counselor to upgrade his diagnosis to\ndependence in full remission: a important indicator of the corrective steps he has taken\nto control his alcohol consumption. \n Certainly, Applicant\u2019s willingness to voluntarily submit professional evaluations of\nhis treatment episodes and indicated progress over the past six years are important\nconsiderations in determining what weight to assign to Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation claims.\nSee ISCR Case 02-03186 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006); ISCR Case 01-20579 at 5 (App. Bd.\nApr. 14, 2004). His recovery efforts to date have been significant and offer a good deal of\npromise for his long-range recovery from alcohol abuse and dependence. With the\nsupport of his sponsor and his AA network, he has been able to sustain his self-imposed\nabstinence for over a year, and has earned AA chips to commemorate his year of\nabstinence.  He has not experienced any kind of alcohol-related incident away from work\nsince his last DUI in August 1991, and he presents little risk now in light of the passage\nof time of any recurrent incident in the foreseeable future.\n\n8\nDespite Applicant\u2019s assurances of his sincere abstinence commitment, and a solid\nyear-plus of sustained abstinence, his time in sobriety is still relatively short, when\nassessed against a backdrop of recurrent drinking abuses over a 25-year period.  With a\nfamily history of alcohol dependence, a recurrent pattern of diagnosed alcohol\ndependence diagnoses within the past six years, and a medical condition (diagnosed\ndepression) that could be exacerbated by any concurrent use of alcohol in during any\nrecurrent depression episode, there is enough to warrant the application of disqualifying\nconditions, subject to any carefully considered mitigating conditions that takes into\naccount his current abstinence regimen. \nOn balance, under these circumstances, there is ample evidence of record to\naccord Applicant the full benefit of several mitigating conditions: MC \u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much\ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d MC \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to\novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and MC \u00b6 23(d), \u201cthe individual has\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has\nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\u201d\nWhole-person \nevaluations \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nrecovery \nefforts \nand \nstrong\nendorsements from his supervisors and colleagues establish that Applicant is a\nresponsible contractor employee who has been able to inspire trust and reliance in his\nwork and overall contributions to his team and community. With the aid of his AA support\nsystem, and respectable period of self-imposed sobriety, Applicant has been able to\npersuade his treating substance abuse counselor to upgrade his principal diagnosis of\nApplicant from alcohol dependence, in early remission, to alcohol dependence, in\nsustained full remission. This represents an important milestone for Applicant and\ndemonstrates that his current counselor is persuaded that Applicant is fully committed to\nhis recovery.  Applicant\u2019s efforts fully document his commitment to abstinence. \nTaking into account both Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his strong work\nrecord, the applicable guidelines, and a whole person assessment of his most recent\nalcohol abstinence efforts and upgraded diagnosis, conclusions warrant that he has the\nresource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses\nrelated to alcohol.  Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are enough at this time to warrant safe\npredictions that he is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with alcohol\nabuse.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the\nalcohol consumption guideline of the SOR. \n\n9\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs.\nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):       FOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.d:\n               For Applicant \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to classified\ninformation.
