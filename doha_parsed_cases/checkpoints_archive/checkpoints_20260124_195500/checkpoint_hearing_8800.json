On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn April 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nDOHA received the request and the case was assigned to me on July 2, 2009.\nApplicant and Department Counsel agreed to an August 26, 2009, hearing date. On\nJuly 27, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for that date. The\nhearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted six exhibits (GE)\n1-6 without objection. Applicant did not introduce any exhibits. He testified on his own\nSeptember 22, 2009\n\n2\nbehalf. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 3, 2009. Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 30, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k of the SOR with explanations. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1998. He has been employed since 1999. He attended some college\ncourses in 2001. Applicant married in 2002 and has two children from that marriage. He\nhas worked for his current employer since May 2007 (Tr. 9). \nApplicant worked in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait for periods of time in 2007 and\n2008. While he was deployed overseas, his wife handled the household financial affairs.\nShe did not pay the household bills in his absence. He acknowledged that there were\nlate bills prior to his deployment (Tr. 14). Applicant stated that he would use the extra\nmoney that he earned when overseas to \u201ccatch up\u201d on the bills. He admitted that he\nshould have paid more attention, but he was out of the country and took for granted that\nhis wife would pay the bills. Instead, he acknowledged that the situation worsened (Tr.\n14).\nWhen Applicant learned that he and his wife had delinquent debt, he became\noverwhelmed. He claimed he did not know how to handle the situation. He did not check\nhis credit reports. When he spoke to a government investigator in April 2008, he stated\nhe would arrange payments for the delinquent debts (GE 6). He realizes that he is\nultimately responsible for the delinquent debts (Tr. 15). He believes the only way to cure\nthe situation is to return overseas and make more money to pay off the bills (Tr. 15). He\nand his wife are now seeking a divorce (Tr. 37).\nThe SOR alleges eleven delinquent debts, including medical accounts, a truck\nrepossession and credit card accounts. The delinquent debts total approximately\n$16,000 (GE 3). Applicant has not paid any of the delinquent debts. He believes he\ndefaulted on payments for his truck and some credit cards in 2004 (Tr. 19). Some of the\nmedical bills are from 2004 or 2005. He believes he made payments of $148 and $215\non two of his debts. He had no documentation for this assertion (Tr. 23). He\nacknowledged that one account for $414 (1.k) is an overdraft that he forgot to pay (Tr.\n23).\nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. He does not have a\nrepayment plan for any of his debts. He states he does not know how to contact many\nof the creditors. However, several accounts are for medical procedures that Applicant\u2019s\nwife had in 2002 (Tr. 20). He acknowledged that he co-signed a loan so that she could\nhave elective surgery. \n\n3\nIn September 2008, Applicant answered interrogatories and again promised to\nsettle or make payment arrangement for his delinquent debts (GE 5). He noted that he\nwould pay the small medical accounts as soon as possible. He has not done so.  He\nintends to pay on the accounts when the divorce agreement is final (Tr. 37).\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is approximately $2,400. He has some retirement\nsavings. He is paying child support. He is living with his parents. He does not have any\ncredit cards (Tr. 39).\nApplicant loves his job. He wants to continue his work overseas. His father was\nin the military and he is proud to serve his country.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n4\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on several accounts over a\nperiod of time. His credit reports confirm the debts. He admits that he has $16,000 in\ndelinquent debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\nlearned that his wife had not paid household bills. He defaulted on some accounts as\nearly as 2004. He has not paid any of the accounts. This mitigating condition does not\napply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s wife did not\npay the bills while Applicant was overseas. This may have exacerbated the problem but\n\n5\nhe had financial difficulties prior to 2007 and 2008. Applicant has promised to repay his\ndelinquent debts but he has not acted responsibly by paying the accounts. This is not a\nfactor for consideration.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling. He has not\nresolved the delinquent accounts. His efforts are insufficient to carry his burden in this\ncase. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the Government\u2019s case. Applicant has been steadily employed since 1999.\nHe has worked for a defense contractor since 2007. While he noted that his wife did not\npay bills while he was overseas, he admitted that he is ultimately responsible for the\ndebts. When he learned of the delinquent accounts, he did not take action to resolve the\ndebts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a: - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant was born in Poland, and he came to the U.S. with his parents and brother in July 1994 (Tr. 19). He finished high school and took some college courses in the U.S. (Tr. 20). He became a U.S. citizen in June 2004. His mother became a U.S. citizen in December 2004, and his father became a U.S. citizen in May 2005. His only sibling, a brother, is a Polish citizen.

Before the hearing, \nhe surrendered his passport to his security officer. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 27, 2008. On \nJanuary 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline C. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nApril 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 3, 2009; answered it in an undated \ndocument, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on February 6, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 3, \n2009; and the case was assigned to me on March 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 13, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 2, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AX) A, which was admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of \nthe hearing on April 2, 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 15, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old engineering assistant for a federal contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since September 2007. He has never held a security \nclearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Poland, and he came to the U.S. with his parents and \nbrother in July 1994 (Tr. 19). He finished high school and took some college courses in \nthe U.S. (Tr. 20). He became a U.S. citizen in June 2004. His mother became a U.S. \ncitizen in December 2004, and his father became a U.S. citizen in May 2005. His only \nsibling, a brother, is a Polish citizen. His parents and his brother all live with him (Tr. \n27). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was working in the U.S. until he was permanently disabled by a \njob-related injury (Tr. 25). His mother and brother are both employed in the U.S. (Tr. 25; \nGX 2 at 3). \n \n \nApplicant was issued a Polish passport in June 2002, with an expiration date in \nJune 2012. Applicant has never used his Polish passport, and he has no plans to visit \nPoland or live there (Tr. 20, 22, 28).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents own a home in Poland. In May 2008, he told a security \ninvestigator he kept his Polish passport because, if he inherited his parent\u2019s property, he \nwould be subjected to higher taxes and expenses as a non-citizen (GX 2 at 3). In his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories on September 16, 2008, he stated he intended to \nkeep his Polish passport because it is the only form of identification that identifies him \nas a Polish citizen, and his Polish passport would \u201csave [him] a lot of time and money\u201d if \nhe inherited his parents\u2019 property (GX 2 at 2).  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified his concern about avoiding taxes arose from \nconversations with his parents, but had not researched the applicable Polish law (Tr. \n27-28). Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel presented any evidence on Polish \nlaw. Applicant admitted at the hearing that he did not know what would happen to the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nproperty, because his parents had been living in the U.S. for 15 years, and it is possible \nthey might sell it (Tr. 23). \n \n \nApplicant testified he did not fully understand the implications of his Polish \npassport when he was interviewed by the security investigator and when he answered \nthe DOHA interrogatories. Once he found out that the passport raised security concerns \nand that he could resolve them easily by surrendering his passport, he surrendered his \nPolish passport to his facility security officer (FSO), who will retain it until it expires or \nApplicant no longer needs a security clearance (Tr. 26; AX A). \n \n \nApplicant testified he is willing to renounce his Polish citizenship (Tr. 23). When \nhe surrendered his Polish passport, he inquired about the procedure for renouncing his \nPolish citizenship. He was informed that it costs \u201cthousands of dollars,\u201d takes more than \na year, and must be approved personally by the President of Poland. He concluded he \nis financially unable to pursue that option at this time (Tr. 18).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Poland and the U.S. \n(\u00b6 1.a); he possessed a Polish passport issued on June 13, 2002, that will expire on \nJune 13, 2012 (\u00b6 1.b); and he will inherit property in Poland from his parents and his \nPolish passport will save him time and money (\u00b6 1.c). The concern under this guideline \nis set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates.\u201d A disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). A disqualifying condition \nalso may arise from \u201cusing foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(5). \n  \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, \neven for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might \npose a challenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, \n2009). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of an active Polish passport after becoming a U.S. citizen \nraises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Department Counsel argued that AG \u00b6 10(a)(5) is also raised, but \nthe evidence supporting that argument is meager. Applicant has only an expectation of \ninheriting property; he has inherited nothing. He admitted he does not know in what \nform he will receive his inheritance. If the property is sold and the proceeds deposited in \na U.S. institution or reinvested in the U.S., his Polish citizenship and passport will be \nirrelevant. Finally, there is no reliable evidence showing that his inheritance would be \naffected if he renounced his citizenship, because neither side presented any evidence \nof the applicable Polish law. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c is based solely on Applicant\u2019s \nanswers in response to investigators\u2019 questions about his motivation for keeping his \nPolish citizenship and passport.  \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s answers to the investigators indicate he was \ninitially reluctant to renounce his citizenship because he was concerned that it might \naffect his inheritance. AG \u00b6 10(a)(5) focuses on an applicant\u2019s mindset, not the \naccuracy of his or her understanding of the situation. Recognizing that security \ndeterminations should err on the side of denying a clearance, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nsubjective concern for his possible inheritance of property in Poland is sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6 10(a)(5). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and (5), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a).  Security concerns also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual has expressed a \nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). Finally, security concerns based \non possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 11(e).  All of these mitigating conditions are established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant came to the U.S. with his family as a teenager, and has lived all his \nadult life in the U.S. He was candid and sincere at the hearing. When faced with a \nchoice between his security clearance and the possibility that a future inheritance might \nbe more complicated and expensive, he resolved the conflict in favor of his security \nclearance. He has never used his Polish passport, and he has no interest in returning to \nPoland. All of his immediate family lives with him in the U.S. His career aspirations are \noriented on the U.S. The evidence clearly shows he prefers the U.S. over Poland. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant, 50 years old, was an enlisted service member in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1979 to 1987. He was trained in electronics and satellite communications. Applicant is a systems analyst, and has been with the same defense contractor since 1987. He has held a top secret security clearance since the late 1980s. As part of a job assignment, Applicant lived in Taiwan from 1996 to 1998 and from 2004 to 2006 (GE 1, 2, 3; Tr. 18-32, 49, 63). Applicant first married in 1983 and had a stepson and two sons from the marriage. They are now 20, 25 and 30 years old. His 25-year-old son has lived and worked in China for the past three years. He is aware that his father has a security clearance (GE 2). Applicant's first wife died in 1995. He married his second wife, a Taiwanese citizen, in 1996.3 He has two sons from his second marriage, who are 9 and 12 years old. They are dual U.S.-Taiwan citizens, and live with their mother in Taiwan. As of 2008, Applicant was providing approximately $1,100 per month child support for his sons in Taiwan. He divorced his second wife in May 2006.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on January 3, 2007. After reviewing \nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office \n \n1 \nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n \n \n2 \n                                                          \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn June 10, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that \nspecified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on July \n6, 2009, Applicant admitted all the allegations except allegations 1.b. and 1.h. under \nGuideline B, and allegation 2.b. under Guideline E. He also requested a decision without \na hearing. In accordance with \u00b6E3.1.8 of the Directive, however, the government \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on July 30, 2009, and the case was assigned to me September 4, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 7, 2009, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on November 5, 2009. The government offered three exhibits, marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified, but did not offer exhibits or witness testimony. DOHA received the transcript on \nNovember 12, 2009. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nPrior to the hearing, by memorandum dated July 29, 2009, the government \namended the SOR as follows:  \n \n \n \nGuideline B: The government withdrew factual allegations 1.f. and 1.g. \n \n \n \nGuideline E: The government withdrew the entire paragraph. \n \nApplicant had no objection, and the SOR is so amended. \n \n \nAt the hearing, the government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The facts are summarized at \npages 1 through 10 of the request, and supported by 15 documents pertaining to the \nPRC (identified as Hearing Exhibit I). The documents are included to provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. The facts administratively noticed are limited \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President \non December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and \nthey apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nto matters of general knowledge not subject to reasonable dispute, and included in \ngovernment reports. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 50 years old, was an enlisted service member in the U.S. Marine Corps \nfrom 1979 to 1987. He was trained in electronics and satellite communications. Applicant \nis a systems analyst, and has been with the same defense contractor since 1987. He \nhas held a top secret security clearance since the late 1980s. As part of a job \nassignment, Applicant lived in Taiwan from 1996 to 1998 and from 2004 to 2006 (GE 1, \n2, 3; Tr. 18-32, 49, 63).  \n \nApplicant first married in 1983 and had a stepson and two sons from the marriage. \nThey are now 20, 25 and 30 years old. His 25-year-old son has lived and worked in \nChina for the past three years. He is aware that his father has a security clearance (GE \n2). Applicant's first wife died in 1995. He married his second wife, a Taiwanese citizen, in \n1996.3 He has two sons from his second marriage, who are 9 and 12 years old. They are \ndual U.S.-Taiwan citizens, and live with their mother in Taiwan. As of 2008, Applicant \nwas providing approximately $1,100 per month child support for his sons in Taiwan. He \ndivorced his second wife in May 2006. From July to October 2004 and again from \nOctober 2005 to July 2006, Applicant had an intermittent relationship with a Taiwanese \nwoman (GE 1, 2, 3; Tr. 18-32, 49, 63, 71-72).  \n \nIn June 2006, Applicant met his third and current wife, a Chinese citizen, on an \ninternet dating website that focused on Asian women. She holds a Ph.D degree and was \nan English teacher at a Chinese university from 2005 to 2008. He testified that he did not \nbelieve the school was affiliated with the government; however, in his interrogatory \nresponse, he indicated that it was. He was required to obtain proof of eligibility to marry \nand a \u201cpermission to marry\u201d certificate from the Department of State and the Chinese \nEmbassy, and they married in September 2006 in China. His wife remained in China for \napproximately two years. During this period, Applicant traveled to China to visit her \napproximately five times. He also took two trips to Taiwan to see his family there during \nthe same period. In June 2008, he traveled to China to assist his wife during the \nimmigration process, when she moved to the United States (GE 1, 2, 3; Tr. 18-32, 49, \n63).  \n \nApplicant's wife received a conditional residency in June 2008, which will expire in \nJune 2010. At that time, he expects her to apply for permanent U.S. residency. She \nteaches the Chinese language at a university in Applicant's state and is pursuing a \n \n3 Applicant mistakenly stated in his security clearance application that he was married to his second wife \nin 1986. The correct date, according to his testimony and interrogatory response (GE 1; Tr. 19), is 1996. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ngraduate degree. She became aware of his security clearance status when he informed \nher that his security clearance interview was pending. She is also aware that he works \non military vehicle communications (GE 2; Tr. 33-35; 50). \n \n \nApplicant's wife\u2019s family lives in China. His mother-in-law is a 63-year-old retired \nschool teacher who lives in China. His father-in-law is a 65-year-old retired college \nteacher. Applicant testified that he is unaware if the schools were affiliated with the \nChinese government; however, he indicated they were government owned or operated \nin his interrogatory response. Applicant's brother-in-law is married, 36 years old, and \nworks as a free-lance environmental impact consultant to companies. Applicant's sister-\nin-law is 32 years old and lives with her parents. She is single, and works as a reporter \nand editor for an independent television station. None of his wife\u2019s family has visited \nApplicant and his wife in the United States (GE 3; Tr. 36-41; 50; 62). \n \n \nApplicant's wife\u2019s son is 13 years old. He has been living in China with \nApplicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law, and at times with his father. Applicant and \nhis wife have not provided financial support for him. At the end of 2008, Applicant's wife \ncoordinated the process to obtain an immigrant visa for her son, and Applicant \nsponsored him. He was expected to arrive in the United States in November 2009 to \nlive here permanently with Applicant and his wife. Applicant will also sponsor his step-\nson for a permanent visa. Applicant's wife speaks with her son by telephone every two \nto three days, and with her mother and sister about once per week. Applicant has met \nand talked with his mother-in-law and his sister-in-law. Applicant and his wife do not \nhave contact often with her father or brother. He believes that his wife will not inherit \nproperty from her family in China. She does not have financial assets in China (Tr. 22; \n36-48; 59-60). \n \nApplicant keeps his security officer informed of his foreign travel. He is kept \ninformed by his company of security and foreign travel issues. He agrees that he is in \nan exploitable position, given his foreign family, but believes that he would \u201cdo the right \nthing\u201d and report to his security officer any attempts to exploit him. Applicant testified \nthat although he does not think he has been targeted during foreign travel, he has met \npeople two or three times \u201cwho are just a little too inquisitive, and, usually, you just \nignore them or don\u2019t even get on the subject at all.\u201d  He has also received emails on his \npersonal computer, written In Chinese, that he believes were advertisements, but has \ndeleted them without opening them (Tr. 52-56, 65). \n \nApplicant testified that he and his wife do not plan to return to China at the \npresent time. However, in his security interview, he stated that he expected that he and \nhis wife would visit her family in China. He also stated he is open to the idea of retiring \nto Taiwan or China (GE 2; Tr. 57-58). \n \nApplicant's wife currently holds a Chinese passport. He believes that when she \nbecomes a U.S. citizen, she should retain her Chinese passport. In relation to his \nTaiwanese sons\u2019 U.S. and foreign passports, he also testified that, \u201cI don\u2019t know why \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nanybody would want to give up their, you know, born national passport\u2026I pushed \nheavily for my sons to make sure they kept theirs. It just makes sense to me to not give \nup something like that.\u201d \u201c\u2026I always felt that, you know, they should keep those both, \nand keep them both up to date, and active.\u201d (Tr. 73-74). \n \nThe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \n \n \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party, which ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed.4 \nOpenness and economic reform have increased, and foreign journalists were allowed \ngreater freedom during the most recent Olympic Games. In addition, the United States \nand China have cooperated in some areas, including various law enforcement matters, \ntransnational health issues, and threats posed by North Korea\u2019s and Iran\u2019s nuclear \nprograms.  \n \n \nHowever, according to the State Department\u2019s 2008 Human Rights Report, the \nChinese government\u2019s human rights record remained poor and worsened in some \nareas. The government engaged in harassment, detention, and imprisonment of those \nperceived as threatening to the government, as well as unlawful killings by security \nforces, physical abuse and torture of prisoners, and denial of fair public trials. \nAuthorities monitored telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, text messages, \nand internet and email communications. Security services routinely monitored and \nentered residences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, and fax \nmachines. In 2009, the U.S. State Department warned that foreign visitors in China may \nbe placed under surveillance, hotel rooms and telephones may be monitored, and \npersonal possessions may be searched without the traveler\u2019s knowledge or consent. In \naddition, Americans in China, including those staying with relatives or friends, must \nregister with local police when they arrive. \n \n \nThe PRC possesses large military forces that are transforming into a smaller, \nmore mobile high-tech military. Civil-military integration has led to increased use of \ncommercial systems in military applications. The PRC has aggressively targeted \nsensitive and protected U.S. economic and militarily critical information subject to export \ncontrol laws. The PRC blends intelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert \nespionage activity by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, \nand military industries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting \nethnic Chinese who have access to sensitive information. Americans of Chinese \nancestry are considered prime intelligence targets. \n \n \nAmong the record number of countries (108) that engaged in collection efforts \nagainst the United States in 2005, the PRC was among the most aggressive. Ethnic \nChinese with U.S. citizenship and/or legal residency have been convicted of procuring \nand exporting or attempting to export sensitive U.S. technology to the PRC. U.S. \n \n4 The facts cited derive from the documents submitted by Department Counsel, identified as Hearing \nExhibit I. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and \nindustrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology. The \nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission\u2019s 2007 Report to Congress \nconcluded that Chinese espionage activities in the United States are so extensive that \nthey comprise the single greatest risk to the security of U.S. technologies.5 \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised AG.6 \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, \ncommonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The presence or absence of a \ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an \napplicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case \ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or \ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative \nfactors addressed under Guideline B. \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest7 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.8 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \n \n5  There is no allegation that Applicant or his family has engaged in economic espionage or attempted to \nviolate export controls for the benefit of the PRC. The criminal activity of others is relevant to the extent it \nreflects ongoing efforts by the PRC to target U.S. sensitive technologies. \n \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern under Guideline B: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all the disqualifying conditions, and find that the \nfollowing are relevant to the case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nThe possession of close family ties with a resident or citizen of a foreign country \nis not, of itself, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, the country in question must \nbe considered and, in particular, whether or not that country targets United States \ncitizens to obtain protected information. The PRC is an active collector of such \ninformation, and so presents a heightened risk of exploitation, manipulation, or \n \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \ncoercion.10 Applicant and his wife share living quarters. In addition, as of the date of the \nhearing, he expected his step-son, a Chinese citizen, to arrive from China shortly to \nbegin living permanently with him. Applicant sponsored the immigrant application of his \nstep-son. Applicant\u2019s actions indicate that he has ties of obligation to his family \nmembers who are citizens and residents of the PRC. His demonstrated ties of affection \nto his wife, and at least ties of obligation to his Chinese step-son, represent a \nheightened risk of exploitation, and support application of AG \u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d).  \n \n \nI have also considered the mitigating conditions under Guideline B, especially the \nfollowing:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \n \n \nIt cannot confidently be predicted that Applicant would not be placed in a position \nthat could force him to choose between U.S. and foreign interests. He is bound by \nstrong ties of affection to his wife, a citizen of a country that is one of the most \naggressive collectors of U.S. sensitive information. Applicant admits that his foreign \nfamily places him in an \u201cexploitable\u201d position. Applicant has not presented information to \nshow that his foreign relatives could not be subject to coercion that would force him to \nchoose between their interests and those of the United States. AG \u00b6 8 (a) cannot be \napplied. \n \n \n In evaluating mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b), I considered Applicant's eight years of \nhonorable military service, and his continued service to the government through more \nthan 20 years employment with a defense contractor. However, the extent of Applicant's \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nties in the United States must be evaluated as well. The record shows that Applicant \nlived outside the United States, in Taiwan, from 1996 to 1998, and again from 2004 to \n2006. He has consistently chosen to seek out relationships with foreign nationals, even \nwhile he held security clearances. He was married to a Taiwanese citizen for 10 years, \nand had two sons born in Taiwan. Shortly after his divorce, he sought out a dating \nservice that focused on Asian women, and within two months of meeting a Chinese \nwoman online, he traveled to China and married her. He has strong ties to his current \nwife, who is still a citizen of China, and is willing to live with and support her son, also a \nChinese citizen. Given China\u2019s aggressive targeting of sensitive information, and \nApplicant's strong ties to Chinese citizens, I cannot confidently conclude that any \nconflict of interest would be resolved in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his in-laws appear to be casual. However, his \nrelationship with his step-son cannot be so characterized. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that applicants have a non-casual relationship with the immediate family of \na spouse. In regard to Applicant's step-son, the presumption is not rebutted. Applicant \nhas shown his willingness to sponsor his step-son\u2019s immigration to the United States, to \nbring him into his own household and to support him here in the United States. His \nactions demonstrate his sense of obligation to his step-son. These facts raise a risk of \nforeign influence or exploitation. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not mitigate Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nApplicant receives some mitigation because he informs his security officer about \nhis foreign travel and is aware of the risk represented by his foreign family. However, \nApplicant's persistent involvement with foreign citizens, even while holding a security \nclearance, and while acknowledging that such contacts place him in an \u201cexploitable\u201d \nposition, raises questions about his judgment. The mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(e) is \ninsufficient to outweigh the disqualifying conditions. I find against Applicant under \nGuideline B. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guidelines. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited guideline, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n \nWhen Applicant began a relationship with his wife, a foreign national, he was 47 \nyears old. He was a mature, responsible adult who had served 8 years in the Marine \nCorps and had long held a security clearance. Despite his experience and knowledge of \nthe obligations imposed on those who hold security clearances, he began and \ncontinued a relationship with a foreign national, raising serious questions as to his \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. The relationship continues and his involvement with \nApplicant's Chinese family has increased. He has sponsored his step-son, a Chinese \ncitizen, for immigration into the United States. His step-son is about to take up \npermanent residence with Applicant. Most significantly, Applicant's close and ongoing \nrelationship is with foreign nationals of China, a country whose aggressive targeting of \nsensitive United States information poses a heightened risk of exploitation.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts raised under the guideline for foreign \ninfluence. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.e.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. \u2013 1.g.  \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E   \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F on March 2,\n2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR and prepared his answer to the SOR in writing on\nMarch 30, 2009. Applicant requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA\nJuly 31, 2009\n\nDepartment Counsel received the faxed documents on July 21, 2009.\n1\nGE 2 (e-QIP); Tr.  30-31.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 67, 70.\n3\n2\n \nreceived the request on April 3, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nMay 14, 2009, and I received the case assignment on May 15, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June\n18, 2009. The government offered eleven exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf. He submitted one exhibit (AE) A, which was received and admitted into evidence\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 26, 2009. I\nheld the record open until July 20, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  On\nJuly 20, 2009, he submitted additional documents, which have been marked as AE B\nthrough AE P, and admitted without objection.  I received one exhibit from Applicant\u2019s\n1\nbankruptcy attorney, which is marked as AE A-1 and admitted without objection. The\nrecord closed on July 20, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Continue\nApplicant orally requested to continue the hearing on June 17, 2009. After\nhearing argument by telephone conference with both parties, I denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest. Applicant renewed his motion for a continuance at the hearing. Applicant\nsought a continuance to allow time for him to file his bankruptcy petition. I denied\nApplicant\u2019s motion, but held the record open 30 days for Applicant to submit a copy of\nhis bankruptcy petition.  (Tr. 11-15)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the\nSOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request\nfor eligibility for a security clearance.\nApplicant, who is 46 years old, works as an e-mail engineer for the Department\nof State, a position he has held for eight years. He enlisted in the United States Army in\n1982 and retired as an E-6 in 1998. Following his retirement from the Army, he worked\nin computer engineering. He held a security clearance for 26 years without incident.2\nApplicant married his first wife in 1987. They had two sons, who are now 21 and\n19. They divorced in 1991. He paid his former wife child support until December 2007,\nwhen his obligation ceased.3\n\nGE 1; Tr. 68.\n4\nAE P (Medical reports); Tr. 31-33.\n5\nAE E (wife\u2019s monthly retirement statement); Tr. 33.\n6\nTr. 34, 38-41.\n7\nGE 5; Tr. 34-35, 44-45, 81-82.\n8\n3\n \nApplicant and his current wife married in 1992. He has two stepsons from this\nmarriage. One stepson is incarcerated and the other stepson, along with the stepson\u2019s\nwife and two children, lives with Applicant and his wife.4\nApplicant\u2019s wife worked at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. She sustained\ninjuries in the terrorist attacks on that day. Her injuries led to the development of\nautoimmune diseases. She developed palmopantar keratoderma, a type of psoriasis\nwhich causes open cuts on her hands and feet and prevents her from walking for days\nat a time. She later developed rheumatoid arthritis in her knees, which also affects her\nability to walk. She remains under the care of two physicians for her health issues.5\nApplicant\u2019s wife returned to her job one year after the September 11, 2001\nattacks. She continued to work with difficulty. When her employer offered her an early\nretirement, Applicant and she decided to accept the offer. She retired on January 1,\n2005. Her income decreased from $100,000 a year to approximately $11,000 a year.6\nTwo events occurred after Applicant\u2019s wife retired, which impacted his income. In\nApril 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer sold the company. The new owner changed his pay\nstatus from independent contractor with his salary paid for tax purposes on a 1099 form\nto paid employee on a W-2 for taxes. The change in the payment form reduced his\nyearly income from $150,000 to $104,000. Because of the substantial loss in income,\nApplicant obtained a second full-time job, which paid $60,000 a year. This job ended in\nlate 2007. Applicant currently works a part-time job in security in addition to his full-time\njob. His wife works as a non-paid minister in their church.7\nApplicant and his wife purchased their house for $268,000 in 2002. Before his\nwife\u2019s retirement, they also purchased a recreational vehicle (RV) and a time share.\nThey owned two cars. They had credit cards, several with very small limits, and one\nwith a $15,000 limit. They used their credit cards regularly. They carried balances on\nthese cards every month. In 2005, when their income decreased significantly, Applicant\nand his wife returned the RV and directed their time share company to sell their interest.\nApplicant does not know if their time share interest was sold. The holder of the RV loan\nsold this vehicle.   \n8\nIn 2005, Applicant contacted a credit counseling service. This service placed him\nin a payment program, which he did not complete. In his statement to the investigator,\nApplicant stated he withdrew from this program because he could not afford the monthly\n\nGE 5; Tr. 44, 86.\n9\nAE A; AE A-1; Tr. 51, 63-64.\n10\nSOR; GE 9; GE 10; GE 11; Tr. 55, 74.\n11\nTwo months, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s former employer wrote them, indicating that her retirement benefit may end.\n12\nIt has not yet ended. Tr. 38.\nApplicant\u2019s former wife receives more than 50% of his military retirement pay. Tr. 37.\n13\n4\n \npayment, and at the hearing, he indicated that he had problems with the company\nmaking payments, so he withdrew from the service. Either way, Applicant did not\ncomplete the program and did not enroll in another debt consolidation program. He\nresolved some small debts on his own.9\nIn March 2009, Applicant retained the services of a bankruptcy attorney. With the\nassistance of their attorney\u2019s staff, Applicant is developing all the information needed to\nfile his petition for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. As part of this process, Applicant\nand his wife must take on-line debt counseling. As of the hearing, they had not taken\nthese courses. In addition, on advice of his counsel, Applicant has tried to pay some\nsmall bills, but not the rest because of the upcoming bankruptcy filing. By letter dated\nJuly 20, 2009, his bankruptcy attorney advised that Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 petition\nshould be filed within the next 10 days. The purpose of the bankruptcy filing is to\nreorganize Applicant\u2019s debts and repay his debts under a court approved payment plan.\nThe attorney did not provide any time table for when the repayment plan would begin.  \n10\nThe SOR lists 23 debts, including one unpaid judgment and two state tax liens\nfor total debts in excess of $154,000. The government also submitted court information\nsheets, which indicate three additional judgments have been obtained against Applicant.\nTwo of these judgments are listed as unpaid debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.p. Applicant\npaid one judgment, not listed in the SOR, through garnishment of his wife\u2019s checking\naccount. He has a settlement offer on one other judgment (allegation 1.k). One state tax\nlien occurred because the State lost his tax returns for the 2000 and 2001 tax years. He\nhas spoken to state representatives, but has not resolved the issue. The other state tax\nlien is for additional monies owed on his taxes for 2007. He has not resolved either of\nthese issues.11\nApplicant\u2019s gross monthly income from his full-time job for an 80-hour week is\n$9,208 and his net pay is $6,516. Over the last two months, Applicant has been paid for\nadditional hours and received an additional net income of $905. His wife\u2019s net\nretirement income totals $920  and his net military retirement pay is $306.  Applicant\u2019s\n12\n13\nincome from his part-time job varies monthly because his work hours range from 16\nhours at a minimum to 56 hours at a maximum. In the summer, he works more hours. In\nMay 2009, for 16 hours worked in a pay period, he received $371 net pay and in July\n2009, for 56 hours worked in a pay period, he received $1,265 net pay. His son\nprovides at least $400 a month to the household. Applicant receives at least $8,533 a\n\nAE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. 41.\n14\nAG G; Tr. 70-71.\n15\nAE J; AE K; AE L; AE M; AE N.\n16\n5\n \nmonth in net income. In the last three months, he also received an additional $1,800 in\nhousehold income.   \n14\nApplicant prepared a budget which shows his estimated monthly expenses at\n$8,622. Overall, he has sufficient income each month to pay his current bills. Applicant\nmissed several mortgage payments. He and his mortgagor reached an agreement\nabout repaying his arrearage. He increased his monthly payment by $300 for two years\nand is current on his payments. He is not currently paying the full amount of his second\nmortgage. He has two old, paid cars.   \n15\nApplicant resolved two of his three debts with one credit card company and has a\nsettlement offer on the third account, which is now a judgment. He has not paid the\nsettlement offer. Applicant had five accounts with his bank and has resolved two of the\nfive accounts. He paid $1,441 on his past due 2007 state taxes through a garnishment\naction. In March 2009, he developed a payment plan with his home owners association\nto pay his arrearage, and has complied with the plan. He could not locate the\nunidentified medical bill listed in the SOR. The other debts remain unpaid.16\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is of paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n6\n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has not paid\nmost of his old debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n17\n7\n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries began in 2005 when his wife retired and he lost income. His financial\nproblems, however, have continued to increase and remain a serious problem. This\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose when his wife retired because of medical problems\nand his income declined by one-third. He sustained a significant loss of household\nincome. Applicant obtained a second full-time job to help pay his expenses and still\nworks part-time. Despite all his work hours and income, Applicant could not pay his bills.\nThis mitigating condition is partially applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant retained a financial counseling service in 2005. His\nassociation with this company did not last. He has resolved several small debts in the\nlast four years and has worked out a payment plan for his mortgage arrearage and his\nhome owners association arrearage. He complies with both plans. The majority of his\ndebts remain unpaid and his debt problems are not resolved. These mitigating\nconditions have some applicability.17\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n8\n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but\non a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant lost\nnearly $140,000 in income in 2005 when his method of salary payment changed and his\nwife retired for health reasons. To manage this income loss, Applicant obtained a second\nfull-time job to help pay his expenses. He continues to work a second job. His efforts to\nearn income is commendable. Applicant, however, has significant financial problems\nwhich he has not resolved. He incurred debt to finance a life style. Even though he has\nworked extremely hard to earn money, he has mismanaged his resources regularly. He\nearns, and has earned, sufficient money each month to pay his expenses, but missed\npayments on all his bills regularly, leading to his current problem. He intends to file a\nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition and enter into a wage earners plan to repay his debts. He\nhas not yet filed this petition. Even if it is filed shortly, it will take at least six months for all\nthe steps in the bankruptcy process to complete and he begins his repayments. Given\nhis poor debt payment history in the last four years, Applicant needs to establish a track\nrecord for meeting the obligations under his Chapter 13 bankruptcy wage earners plan.\nHe also should show significant improvement in financial management. While Applicant\nhas never violated security procedures in the 26 years he has held a security clearance\nand works very hard, these facts do not outweigh the security concerns about his\nextensive debt and financial problems.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial issues. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\n \nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.v:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.w:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Coacher, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJuly 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on January 16, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 4).  On February 20, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 20, 2009, in which she\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on April 7, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in\nrebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on April 20, 2009, and she submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on June 18, 2009.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 45 years old.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an\nAircraft Mechanic and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her\nemployment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof  having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR, namely that she is\nindebted to six different creditors, incurred over the course of several years, totaling\napproximately $16,772.00.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated April 3, 2009, June\n25, 2008, and February 14, 2008, reflect that the following debts remain owing: a debt\nowed to AFNI-Bloom in the amount of $1,789.00, a debt for medical services in the\namount of $134.00, a debt to Palisades Coll, in the amount of $7,556.00, a debt owed to\nVerizon in the amount $1,197.00, a debt owed to Citifinancia in the amount of $5,862.00\nand a debt owed to CRD PRT ASSO in the amount of $234.00.  (Government Exhibits\n7, 8 and 9).   \nApplicant explains that her indebtedness was a result of a degenerative neck\ncondition that required neck surgery and caused her to miss work in 2004.  At that time,\nher paycheck was substantially reduced and her bills became delinquent.  Applicant\nindicates that she plans to pay the debts, but she does not present any reasonable plan\nas to how she will do so. \nIn April 2008, when she was interviewed by the DoD, she indicated that she was\ncurrent with all of her monthly expenses, but had very little money left at the end of the\nmonth.  At that time, she was also facing another surgery for her neck, which would\nmean more time off for recovery.  She further indicated that when she returned in three\nor four months from her surgery, she would begin to research her delinquent accounts\nand begin paying them off.  Although she had conferred with two or three debt\nconsolidation companies, she had never signed a contract with one or started the\nprocess of financial rehabilitation.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6).  \nIn her answer to the SOR, the Applicant simply admits each of the allegations set\nforth in paragraph 1, requests an decision without a hearing, and does not present any\nevidence in mitigation.  (Government Exhibit 3).  \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\n\n4\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\n\n5\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case. Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying\nConditions 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19.(c) a history of not\nmeeting financial obligation apply.  Mitigating Condition 20.(b) the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances also\napplies, but is not controlling in this case.  \nThe Applicant has not shown sufficient good judgment since her medical\nconditions began in 2004.  Admittedly, her medical condition primarily caused the\nApplicant\u2019s financial demise.  Since then, she has experienced additional medical\nproblems and has still not paid her delinquent debts.  However, she has failed to\npresent any evidence to show that she has consulted with a financial counselor to assist\nher with her finances, or that she has set up payment plans or made any other\narrangements to get her delinquent debts paid.  She has not explained her current\ncircumstances that could be mitigating.  Under the circumstances, she has not made a\ngood faith effort to resolve her indebtedness, and there is insufficient evidence of\nfinancial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has not demonstrated that she can properly\nhandle her financial affairs.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\n    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, however, it does not come close\nto mitigating the negative effects of her financial indebtedness and its impact on her\nability to safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas failed to overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n\n6\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 21, 2007. On \nDecember 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline C. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nMay 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 5, 2009; answered it on January 12, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on January 14, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n27, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on March 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 11, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 1, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nH, which were admitted without objection. The record closed upon adjournment of the \nhearing on April 1, 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 9, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.f, and he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.g. His admissions in his answer \nand at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He was born in Italy, grew up in France, and returned \nto Italy to complete his education. He received a doctoral degree in electrical \nengineering and then performed his compulsory military service in the Italian Navy (Tr. \n24). While in the Italian Navy, he applied for a scholarship to obtain a degree in \nbusiness administration in the U.S. In December 1975, he obtained a master\u2019s degree \nin business administration and a master\u2019s degree in international management (Tr. 24-\n25). The terms of his scholarship required him to return to Italy for two years, but he \nobtained a waiver of that requirement and worked for four years at an Italian \nmultinational corporation in the U.S. (Tr. 26-27).  \n \n \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since March \n2006, and he currently is the vice-president for international sales. For the past 30 \nyears, Applicant has been working for U.S. international businesses in the field of \ninformation technology (Tr. 27-28). He was assigned to work in Italy and France from \n1991 to 1995 (Tr. 43). He has never held a clearance. \n \nApplicant was married in October 1977 to a native-born U.S. citizen. They have \nfour children, ages 29, 26, 22, and 15. The three oldest children were born in the U.S. \nand the youngest was born in France while Applicant was assigned there by his \nemployer. Their children are dual citizens of the U.S. and Italy. Applicant requested \ntermination of his overseas assignment because he wanted his children to complete \ntheir education in the U.S. (Tr. 31-32).  \n \nApplicant testified that he and his U.S.-born wife started serious consideration of \nthe implications of his non-citizen status in 1997, about two years after they returned to \nthe U.S. Among other considerations, they were concerned that his status could have \nadverse financial consequences if he predeceased his wife (Tr. 43-44).  \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in September 2000, and he holds two U.S. \npassports that expire in 2010. He applied for and received an Italian passport in \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDecember 2005 that will expire in December 2015, which he used for multiple business \ntrips in 2006 and 2007. He used his passports interchangeably, depending on which \nwas most convenient, politically expedient, and least expensive. He did not use any \npassport containing Israeli entry and exit stamps to enter Arab countries; he used his \nItalian passport to travel within the European Union because of the ease of entry and \nshort waiting lines; and he generally used whichever passport would incur the least \nexpensive visa fees (Tr. 32-34). Overall, he used his U.S. passports substantially more \noften than his Italian passport (Tr. 60). \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator on January 4, 2008 (GX 2 at 2-3), \nApplicant expressed reluctance to relinquish his Italian passport because of the \nconvenience it offers and for sentimental reasons related to his Italian heritage. When \nasked how he would resolve a conflict between his sense of allegiance to Italy and his \nobligations as a U.S. citizen, he responded that he would need to be faced with a \nspecific situation to make that determination. At the hearing, he was asked what he \nwould do if there was a conflict between U.S. and Italian interests, and he responded \nthat he had lived in the U.S. for a long time, all his interests are in the U.S., and he \nwould be \u201cbiased\u201d toward the U.S. (Tr. 41).  \n \nApplicant is his mother\u2019s only surviving son. In his interview with the security \ninvestigator, he expressed reluctance to renounce his Italian citizenship because of his \nheritage and because it would facilitate dealing with property issues if he inherited \nproperty from his mother, a citizen and resident of Italy. At the hearing, he explained \nthat he knows his Italian citizenship is not a prerequisite for inheriting his mother\u2019s \nproperty, and he is aware of instances where non-Italian persons inherited property \nfrom their Italian parents (Tr. 51, 56).  \n \n \nApplicant has no property in Italy, except for his contributions to an Italian \nretirement plan for about a year and a half while working in Italy and before becoming a \nU.S. citizen. He has not attempted to withdraw any of those contributions. All his other \nassets, including his home and retirement funds, are in the U.S. (Tr. 37-38). He does \nnot intend to return permanently to Italy (Tr. 59).  \n \nOn March 16, 2009, after Applicant was advised by his lawyer that possession \nand use of his Italian passport was viewed as indicative of a foreign preference, he \nsurrendered it to the vice-president and associate general counsel of his company, who \nin turn surrendered it to the company\u2019s security manager (Tr. 14; AX D). At the hearing, \nhe declared he is prepared to do whatever being a U.S. citizen involves (Tr. 34).  \n \nApplicant voted in an Italian election in 2004. He received an absentee ballot \nfrom the Italian Embassy after the Italian government enacted legislation permitting its \ncitizens residing outside Italy to vote by absentee ballot (Tr. 45-46). He testified he felt it \nwas his duty to respond to the ballot (Tr. 35). He also testified he did not believe his \nvote was harmful to the U.S. because he voted for a candidate who resided in the U.S. \n(Tr. 36). He did not realize that voting in an Italian election raised security issues (Tr. \n36). Now that he better understands the situation, he does not feel he has a duty to vote \n\n \n4 \n \n \nin Italian elections (Tr. 36). He has voted in every U.S. election, state and federal, since \nbecoming a U.S. citizen (Tr. 35).  \n \nThe president and chief executive officer of Applicant\u2019s company describes him \nas a person of great integrity, reliable, honest, and loyal to the U.S. (AX B). The chief \noperating officer of the company, a veteran of 22 years in a U.S. intelligence agency, \nhired Applicant. He describes Applicant as hard-working, ethical, honest, and \ntrustworthy (AX C). The security manager of the company considers Applicant honest, \ntrustworthy, reliable, diligent, loyal, and ethical (AX D). Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, a \nretired professional educator, has known him for 31 years and regards him as \ndedicated, hard working, and trustworthy (AX E). A 15-year friend of Applicant, who is a \nscientist and consultant with a top secret clearance, describes Applicant as hard \nworking, honest, mature, and dedicated (AX F). A neighbor who has known Applicant \nfor 11 years regards him as a great role model with high standards and values (AX H). \nAnother neighbor, a retired U. S. Navy vice admiral, has known Applicant for 12 years \nand considers him a fine family man, a credit to the neighborhood, and \u201cthe \nconsummate professional.\u201d He believes Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. is without \nquestion (AX G).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Italy and the U.S. (\u00b6 \n1.a); he applied for, possessed, and used an Italian passport after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d); he intended to renew his Italian passport (\u00b6 1.e); he voted \nin an Italian election in 2004 (\u00b6 1.f); and he maintained his Italian passport because of \nthe benefits it affords in the European Union (\u00b6 1.g). The security concern under this \nguideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000). Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 1999). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is not limited to countries hostile to the \nU.S. \u201cUnder the facts of a given case, an applicant\u2019s preference, explicit or implied, \neven for a nation with which the U.S. has enjoyed long and peaceful relations, might \npose a challenge to U.S. interests.\u201d ADP Case No. 07-14939 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 11, \n2009). \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a). Exercise of \nforeign citizenship includes but is not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign \npassport\u201d; \u201caccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such \nbenefits from a foreign country\u201d; \u201cusing foreign citizenship to protect financial or \nbusiness interests in another country\u201d; and \u201cvoting in a foreign election.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), \n(3), (5), and (7).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of an active Italian passport and voting in an Italian \nelection after becoming a U.S. citizen raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and (7). He contributed to an \nItalian retirement fund while working in Italy, but his contributions were made before he \nbecame a citizen, and he has not attempted to withdraw any money from it. Thus, I \nconclude AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) is not raised. \n \nApplicant is his mother\u2019s sole heir, and he expects to inherit several parcels of \nreal estate from his mother. During a security interview, he expressed reluctance to \nrenounce his Italian citizenship because it would be more cumbersome for him to deal \nwith the Italian property as a non-citizen. However, there is no evidence that Italian \ncitizenship is a prerequisite to inheriting property in Italy. To the contrary, he testified he \nknows non-Italian citizens are able to inherit property from their Italian parents. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 10(a)(5) is not raised. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and (7), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005). \n \nSecurity concerns based on foreign preference may be mitigated if \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). This mitigating condition is not fully established because Applicant actively \nexercised his Italian citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has expressed a \nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(b). This condition is not established \nbecause Applicant has been hesitant to renounce his Italian citizenship, even though he \nhas no plans to return permanently to Italy.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201c(e) the \npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or \notherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition is established by \nApplicant\u2019s surrender of his Italian passport to his security manager. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline C in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is mature, well-educated, and articulate. His testimony at the hearing \nwas candid, careful, thoughtful, and precise. He married a native-born U.S. citizen \nshortly after completing graduate school in the U.S. He decided after completing his \neducation that he preferred living and working in the U.S. He later spent almost five \nyears overseas, but he requested a transfer back to the U.S. so that his children could \ncomplete their educations in the U.S. He exercised dual citizenship before applying for a \nclearance, because he was unaware of the security implications of his acts. After his \nlawyer advised him that his acts raised security concerns, he surrendered his Italian \npassport. He has a reputation as a loyal, reliable, honest, and dedicated citizen of the \nU.S. He retains his attachment to his Italian heritage, but he made it clear at the hearing \nthat his family, his future, and his loyalties are in the U.S. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign preference. Accordingly, I conclude he \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR the SOR allegations with explanations (GE 20). He admitted he did not include his 2003 DWI conviction on his security clearance application, but said the omission was a mistake and not deliberate (GE 20). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 25 years old and has worked for a government contractor for 18 months (Tr. 6, 23, 25). In 2001, he received his graduate equivalency diploma (GED) and he subsequently completed two years of college (Tr. 6). Applicant has been employed in the area of information technology (IT) for three years (Tr. 24) and currently works as a IT help desk coordinator (Tr. 23). He does not hold a security clearance (Tr. 7). He is not married, and has a two-year-old son (Tr. 50). Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct On August 25, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). On October 24, 2001, he was convicted of driving after illegal consumption of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.a, GE 5). He was sentenced to pay a fine and court costs, attend Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and his license was suspended for six months. Id.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant committed three alcohol-related criminal offenses between 2001 and \n2008. His most recent Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) offense occurred on May 25, \n2008, after he applied for a security clearance. Applicant is still on probation and has \nstarted, but not completed all court-ordered alcohol treatment. Applicant failed to \nmitigate security concerns arising from alcohol consumption, personal conduct and \ncriminal conduct. Drug involvement security concerns are mitigated because they are \nnot recent. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1). On August 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant (GE 20). The SOR detailed the \nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for a security clearance \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nNovember 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised, and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption), \nH (drug involvement), E (personal conduct) and J (criminal conduct) (GE 19). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on October 1, 2008, and the \ngovernment subsequently requested a hearing before an administrative judge (GE 20). \nOn October 27, 2008, the case was assigned to me. Applicant waived his right to 15-\ndays\u2019 hearing notice, and his hearing was held on November 5, 2008 (Transcript (Tr.) \n14-15). See ADP Case No. 05-12037 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007) (endorsing process for \nwaiving 15-day notice). Department Counsel offered 17 exhibits (GEs 1-17) (Transcript \n(Tr.) 21-22), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits. There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-17 (Tr. 22). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and \nHearing Notice (GE 18-20). I received the transcript on November 12, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR the SOR allegations with \nexplanations (GE 20). He admitted he did not include his 2003 DWI conviction on his \nsecurity clearance application, but said the omission was a mistake and not deliberate \n(GE 20). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 25 years old and has worked for a government contractor for 18 \nmonths (Tr. 6, 23, 25). In 2001, he received his graduate equivalency diploma (GED) \nand he subsequently completed two years of college (Tr. 6). Applicant has been \nemployed in the area of information technology (IT) for three years (Tr. 24) and currently \nworks as a IT help desk coordinator (Tr. 23). He does not hold a security clearance (Tr. \n7). He is not married, and has a two-year-old son (Tr. 50). \n \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \n \n \nOn August 25, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol (DUI). On October 24, 2001, he was convicted of driving after illegal \nconsumption of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.a, GE 5). He was sentenced to pay a fine and court \ncosts, attend Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and his license was suspended for \nsix months. Id. He paid his fine and court costs on April 26, 2002 (GE 5, 6). \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. His Response to SOR (GE 20) is the source for the facts in \nthis section unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n    \nOn May 3, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI 1st Offense. On \nFebruary 13, 2004, the court found him guilty of DWI and sentenced him 30 days in jail, \nto attend ASAP, and suspended his license for 12 months (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He received a \n$100 fine and $277 in court costs (GE 7). He attended ASAP and some Alcoholics \nAnonymous meetings after the 2003 DWI (Tr. 47, GE 2). \n \nOn February 24, 2004, the court issued a show cause order concerning \nApplicant\u2019s failure to complete ASAP as previously ordered (SOR \u00b6 1.c).  \n \nIn January 2008, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant (Tr. 30-31). Applicant admitted to the OPM investigator that he \nhad a DUI arrest in 2001, and a DWI arrest in 2003 (Tr. 31). Applicant said he had \nlearned his lesson and that he did not have a problem with alcohol (Tr. 31). \n \nOn May 25, 2008, the police arrested Applicant for DWI 2nd Offense and Refusal \nto Provide Blood/Breath Sample and Obstruction of Justice Without Force (SOR \u00b6 1.d, \nGE 15, 16, 17, 20). On September 10, 2008, the court found Applicant guilty of DWI 1st \nOffense, and dismissed the other offenses (Tr. 26). The court adjudged a fine, four days \nin jail, one year of probation, a restricted driver\u2019s license and additional ASAP \nattendance (Tr. 26-30). Applicant currently attends ASAP once a week for two hours, \nand must attend ASAP for four months (Tr. 26-27). He is also required to attend ten \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and to receive outpatient alcohol treatment (Tr. \n27). He has not attended any AA meetings, but intends to do so (Tr. 28, 47-48). His \ninitial outpatient alcohol treatment is scheduled for November 18, 2008 (Tr. 28).  He \nexpects to learn at that time whether he is classified as alcohol dependent or not (Tr. \n49).  \n \nApplicant indicated his 2008 DWI offense showed a lapse in judgment and he \nconceded he made poor decisions (Tr. 32-33). However, he insisted he was not \ndependent on alcohol and did not have a problem with alcohol (Tr. 33-34). He did not \ndrink alcohol at work (Tr. 41). He said \u201cmy judgment at work is completely different from \nwhat I do in my\u2014you know, in\u2014in my social environment . . . the way I, you know, the \nway I conduct business is completely different from what I do outside\u2014you know, \noutside of work\u201d (Tr. 42).  \n \nApplicant is not permitted to drink alcohol as a condition of his probation and he \ncurrently is not drinking alcohol (Tr. 34-35). He declined to rule out resumption of \nalcohol consumption after his probation is concluded in September 2009 (Tr. 35).  \n \nDrug Involvement and Criminal Conduct \n \n \nFrom approximately January 2000 to May 2005, Applicant used marijuana (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a). From approximately January 2000 to March 2007, he used ecstasy (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \nand cocaine (SOR \u00b6 2.c). He purchased marijuana in about April 2002 while on a trip to \nJamaica (SOR \u00b6 2.d). He described his illegal drug use as experimenting with friends \n(Tr. 36-37). He does not associate with the cocaine and ecstasy users; however, he \ncontinues to associate with marijuana users (Tr. 37). He did not use illegal drugs after \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe government contractor hired him on April 16, 2007 (Tr. 38, 44-45). He emphasized \nthat the cut off date for his drug use was April 16, 2007 (Tr. 45-46, GE 2). Before he \nwas hired, he disclosed his drug use to his employer (Tr. 47). \n \nPersonal Conduct and Criminal Conduct \n \n \nIn addition to the information in the alcohol consumption and drug involvement \nsections which pertains to personal conduct under the AGs, on March 22, 2001, \nApplicant was charged with driving under license revocation/suspension, a \nmisdemeanor (SOR \u00b6 3.b). The court found Applicant guilty and sentenced him to 90 \ndays in jail (80 days suspended), to pay court costs, and suspended his license for 90 \ndays.  \n \n \nOn October 12, 2003, Applicant was charged with driving on a suspended \nlicense, eluding police and reckless driving, all misdemeanors (SOR \u00b6 3.c). He received \na $600 fine and $109 court costs (GE 8, 9, 10). He paid the fine and costs on August \n20, 2004 (GE 8, 9, 10).2 He attributed the multiple traffic infractions to intermittent bad \ndriving (Tr. 39-41).     \n \nApplicant listed his 2001 DUI arrest; however, he failed to list his 2003 DWI \ncharge and 2004 DWI conviction in response to Section 23 of his November 9, 2007, \nsecurity clearance application, which requested information about alcohol charges or \nconvictions (SOR \u00b6 3.e). He listed his 2003 eluding police arrest and his extensive drug \nuse on his security clearance application. He also listed an employment ended under \nadverse circumstances, and alcohol treatment he had received. Applicant explained that \nhis security manager requested that he resubmit his security clearance application and \nwhen he resubmitted it he mistakenly failed to list the 2003 DWI arrest, which resulted in \na DWI conviction in February 2004 (Tr. 42-43). When an OPM investigator interviewed \nhim about his clearance he freely admitted omission of the 2004 DWI (Tr. 43). After his \n2008 DWI, he informed his security manager of his arrest (Tr. 47). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \n \n2Applicant\u2019s friend was with him when he was arrested. Applicant\u2019s friend lied to the police and in \ncourt, falsely stating she was driving (SOR \u00b6 3.d, GE 20). Applicant\u2019s friend was charged with perjury and \nconvicted of an amended charge of obstruction on February 24, 2004 (GE 11-13). The court fined her \n$125 and ordered payment of $128 in court costs (GE. 11-13).  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines G (alcohol consumption), H (drug involvement), E \n(personal conduct) and J (criminal conduct) with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b), 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), 22(f) and 22(g) do not apply. He did not \nconsume alcohol at work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. Currently, he \ndoes not habitually consume or engage in binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of \nimpaired judgment. Binge drinking is not defined in the Directive and is not established. \nOn February 24, 2004, the court issued a show cause order concerning Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to complete ASAP as previously ordered (SOR \u00b6 1.c); however, there is no \nevidence that the court found he actually violated a court order regarding alcohol \neducation, evaluation, treatment or abstinence. Although Applicant believed that he \nreceived an alcohol evaluation from an outpatient alcohol treatment facility after his \n2003 DWI arrest, the results of this evaluation are not part of the record, and Applicant \nwas not aware of the diagnosis or prognosis.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies. Applicant was arrested for DUI and convicted of driving after \nillegal consumption of alcohol in 2001. He was convicted of DWI in February 2004 and \nSeptember 2008.  \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a)-(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. On May 25, 2008, the police arrested Applicant for \nDWI 2nd Offense (SOR \u00b6 1.d). On September 10, 2008, the court found Applicant guilty \nof DWI 1st Offense. This DWI is recent. It is his third alcohol-related arrest in eight years. \nThese three events are relatively frequent and recent. He stopped his alcohol \nconsumption as required by his probation, and accordingly he receives some credit \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nbecause his alcohol-related offenses, \u201chappened under such unusual circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a) cannot be fully applied because he \ncontinued to consume alcohol up until May 2008. He has not abstained from alcohol \nconsumption for a sufficient period of time. Additionally, he declined to commit to ending \nhis alcohol consumption after his probation is completed.  \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.3  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not acknowledge being \nalcohol dependent or being an alcoholic. He is minimizing his alcohol consumption \nproblem, refusing to acknowledge that he has an alcohol \u201cproblem.\u201d Although he \ncompleted an alcohol abuse treatment program after his 2003 DUI, he stopped \nattending AA meetings. After his 2008 DWI, he started another court-ordered alcohol \ntreatment program. He stopped consuming alcohol in May 2007. His history of alcohol \nproblems, his failure to fully recognize and acknowledge his alcohol problem, his most \nrecent DWI, and his status as being on probation for his 2008 DWI exclude providing full \nmitigating credit.  \n \nAfter carefully consideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption,4 I conclude his three alcohol-related incidents, his relapse after alcohol \ncounseling in 2004, and his continued alcohol consumption up until May 2008 all raise \nsecurity concerns. His current alcohol-related therapy is a positive development, \nshowing that he continues to struggle to overcome his alcohol problems; however, his \nreluctance to commit alcohol abstinence after he completes probation raises continued \nconcerns. \n   \n \n3See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   \n \n4For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern concerning drug involvement: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug5 involvement-related conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two drug involvement disqualifying \nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this particular \ncase: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d6 and \u201cillegal drug possession.\u201d  AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \nThe other disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable. These \ndisqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy. \nHe possessed these drugs before he used them.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation; \n \n5AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and ecstasy or 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine are Schedule I controlled \nsubstances. See Sch. I (c)(9) and I(c)(10), respectively. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) \n(discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I); United States v. Crawford, 449 F.3d 860, 861 (8th Cir. \n2006) (ecstasy). Cocaine is a Schedule II Controlled Substance. See Sch. II(a)(4) (cocaine).   \n \n6AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner \nthat deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d7 \n \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use was on April 17, 2007, about 18 months ago. AG \u00b6 \n26(a) fully applies despite Applicant\u2019s last illegal drug use being relatively recent. His \noverall illegal drug use lasted approximately seven years (2000 to 2007), and involved \nnumerous uses of marijuana, ecstasy and cocaine. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies because his past \ndrug use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.8 Because of his abstention from drug use for about 18 months, and his \nrecognition of the adverse impact on his life of drug abuse, there is reasonable certitude \nthat he will continue to abstain from drug use. I am reasonably confident his illegal drug \npossession and use will not recur. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the future and \nis subject to drug testing at his employment, confidence in his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment with respect to drug use is restored.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. He has somewhat disassociated from his drug-using \nassociates and contacts. He stopped associating with cocaine and ecstasy users; \nhowever he continues to associate with marijuana users. He has broken his patterns of \ndrug abuse, and changed his life with respect to drug use. He has abstained from drug \nabuse for about 18 months. However, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent \nwith automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are not applicable because Applicant did not abuse \nprescription drugs. The marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy were never prescribed for him. \nHe did not satisfactorily complete a prescribed drug treatment program, including \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements.  \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant ended his drug abuse on April 17, 2007, about 18 months \nago. The motivations to stop using drugs are evident.9 He understands the adverse \nresults from drug abuse. He has shown or demonstrated a sufficient track record of no \ndrug abuse to eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \n                                            \n8In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. \n  \n9Approval of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior .  .  .  .  ; and (3) a pattern \nof .  .  .  rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a re-alleges the drug and alcohol-related misconduct discussed \npreviously. With respect to the personal conduct concerns involving this misconduct, the \npertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule violations and AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.\u201d Certainly, drug and alcohol abuse as well as DUI and DWI offenses \nviolate important civil and criminal rules in our society, and a lengthy history of such \nmisconduct is conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a person\u2019s \nprofessional and community standing. The mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e) \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \napplies to this misconduct. Applicant\u2019s supervisor and security officials are well aware of \nthis misconduct. Through the security process this misconduct has been disclosed, \neliminating any vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe this \nApplicant would compromise national security to avoid public disclosure of this \nmisconduct. These personal conduct security concerns, pertaining to alcohol \nconsumption and drug involvement, are mitigated.   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c allege two misdemeanor traffic offenses. Applicant \ncommitted these offenses and AG \u00b6\u00b6 16 (e)(1) and (e)(3) apply. SOR \u00b6 3.d alleges \nApplicant and his friend attempted to falsely convince the police and court that he was \nnot driving, which was a violation of his probation. His friend was convicted of \nobstruction.    \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6 17(f) applies to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his 2003 DWI on his security \nclearance application (SOR \u00b6 3.e). This failure was not deliberate, and the allegation of \nfalsification is unsubstantiated.10   \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(c) theoretically could mitigate SOR \u00b6 3.b and 3.c because his two traffic \nviolations in 2001 and 2003 are relatively minor misdemeanors. They are not recent and \ninfrequent. However, the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence requires consideration of all \nsuch offenses in a non-piecemeal fashion. The Judge is required to evaluate the record \nevidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of his \nconduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). Because of his overall conduct, especially the \n2008 DWI, none of the offenses are mitigated under guideline AG \u00b6 17(c).       \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(g) all apply in part. His criminal offenses cannot be \nfully mitigated for the reasons stated previously. See Discussion in Alcohol \nConsumption Section, supra. There is still a risk that Applicant will return to alcohol \nabuse and that more alcohol-related offenses will occur. There are some positive signs \nof rehabilitation. He admitted his misconduct. No allegations of problems at his \nemployment have surfaced. He has ceased his associations with those persons who \nused cocaine and ecstasy. See AG \u00b6 17(g). He is in the process of completing his most \nrecent probation, and he paid his fines and court costs. He has demonstrated remorse, \nan important step toward his rehabilitation. He received job training and has a good \nemployment record. He disclosed his 2001 alcohol-related offense, his illegal drug use, \nand an adverse termination from employment on his November 9, 2007, security \nclearance application (GE 1). He disclosed his 2003 DWI to an Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator, and told his security manager about his 2008 DWI. \nHis security manager is well aware of his alcohol-related problems and drug abuse \nproblems. Disclosure has eliminated his \u201cvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress.\u201d \n \nCriminal Conduct \n  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \n10The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d The allegations of criminal conduct listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.b, 3.c and 3.d are all established. He admitted all offenses.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to the offenses listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.d, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.b, 3.c and 3.d. There is still a risk that Applicant will return to \nalcohol abuse and that more offenses will occur. See Discussion in Alcohol \nConsumption Section, supra. There are some positive signs of rehabilitation. He \nadmitted his misconduct and said he ceased his alcohol consumption after his May 25, \n2008, DWI arrest. He has performed well at his employment. He has stopped \nassociating with his friends who use ecstasy and cocaine, reducing the associations \nthat enabled and facilitated some of his drug problems. He has articulated remorse and \nis received alcohol counseling and treatment. There is a sufficient evidentiary record in \nthis case of his rehabilitation to merit a clearance eventually, provided his good behavior \nand alcohol abstinent behavior continue.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. \nWhen Applicant\u2019s government contractor employer hired him approximately 18 months \nago, he stopped using illegal drugs. He has always been candid concerning derogatory \ninformation. He revealed one of his DUIs and some of his alcohol treatment and therapy \non his 2007 security clearance application. He provided more detailed information about \nhis alcohol problems to an OPM investigator. He admitted in his SOR response and at \nhis hearing complete information to the best of his recollection. After his May 25, 2008, \nDWI, he stopped consuming alcohol. He knows the consequences if he is caught with \nalcohol on his breath at work or has another DWI. He is currently receiving alcohol \ntreatment and will start attending Alcohol Anonymous meetings. Applicant is a valued \nemployee, who contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is no \nevidence at work of any disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of disloyalty or that \nhe would intentionally violate national security. His character and good work \nperformance shows some responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors \nevidently support him or he would not have been able to retain his employment after his \nsecurity clearance was called into question. I am satisfied that if he continues to abstain \nfrom alcohol consumption, and avoids future offenses he will have future potential for \naccess to classified information.  \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a substantial problem with alcohol as shown by three alcohol-related \ntraffic offenses between 2001 and 2008. He received some alcohol-related treatment \nand attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after his 2003 DWI arrest. Then he had a \nrelapse as shown by his 2008 DWI arrest and conviction. His problems with alcohol \ncannot be mitigated at this time. His decision to continue to drink alcohol over the years \nwas knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. Excessive alcohol consumption shows a lack of judgment \nand/or impulse control. Such conduct raises a serious security concern, and a security \nclearance is not warranted at this time. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption, \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct. Drug involvement is mitigated because it is not \nrecent.    \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \n                                            \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b to 3.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his most recent Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on\nDecember 5, 2007. He submitted earlier SF 86's in 2000 and 2004. On November 20,\n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and E for Applicant.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 26, 2008 and elected\nto have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 3, 2009. Applicant received a\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on February 6, 2009 and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nMay 27, 2009\n\nThe Government submitted nine items in support of its case.\n1\n2\nGovernment\u2019s case.  Applicant did not submit additional information. I received the case\n1\nassignment on May 11, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.c of the SOR. He also admitted the allegations in \u00b6 2.a through 2.g. He did\nnot provide additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school and obtained an undergraduate degree in 1976. He is married and has\nthree grown children. He has worked in a professional capacity in the computer science\nfield for his entire career. He has been with his current employer since 2002 (Item 1).\nWhen Applicant was in college, from 1972 until 1976, he smoked marijuana. He\nexplained that it was easily accessible and considered somewhat acceptable in the\ncollege setting. He believes his usage could be characterized as \u201cexperimental\u201d. He\nacknowledged using marijuana on average once or twice a month at parties (Item 6).\nIn the 1980's and late 1990's Applicant also used marijuana on one or two\noccasions during camping trips with friends. He claims his \u201clast use\u201d was in 2006 (Items\n1 and 3). Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR is inconsistent concerning the use of\nmarijuana. He explained that he had been drinking on the camping trip in June 2006\nand was somewhat impaired and does not really remember if he used marijuana (Item\n3).\nApplicant held a secret clearance in October 1995 and continued to hold a secret\nclearance in January 2003. In October 2005, he was granted a top secret clearance.\nDuring that time Applicant admits using cocaine at a Christmas party in 2006 and during\na poker game to stay awake in 2004 (Item 6). He stated that he used marijuana during\nhis adult years due to \u201cpeer pressure\u201d (Item 5).\nIn 2007, Applicant completed two separate security clearance applications.\nApplicant answered questions 24 and 27 concerning use of illegal drugs. He responded\n\u201cno\u201d to any illegal use for both questions. His earlier security clearance applications\ncompleted in 2004 and 2000 also did not reflect any illegal drug use as Applicant\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to those questions. He intentionally omitted any information concerning\nillegal drug use.\nIn April 2007, Applicant was interviewed by another government agency (Item 6).\nHe admitted a history of marijuana use during his interview for SCI clearance. He also\ntold the investigator that he used cocaine once at a Christmas party. However, after\n\n3\nfurther questioning, he conceded that he initially withheld information about additional\ninvolvement with cocaine due to \u201cembarrassment\u201d. He estimated that he used cocaine\nbetween five and ten times while playing poker with friends. He was denied clearance\nfor SCI in August 2007 (Item 6). The admission concerning the cocaine use with NSA is\ndifferent than the admission to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR when he stated he only\nused cocaine on two occasions to stay awake during a poker game.\nIn March 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for DoD. He told the\ninvestigator that his last use of any illegal drug was in 2000 or 2001. He omitted any\ninformation concerning illegal drug use with cocaine in 2004 or 2006 (Item 5). \nApplicant admits that he answered all questions concerning illegal drug use on\nhis security clearance applications due to \u201cembarrassment\u201d. He acknowledges using\nbad judgment. He also explains that he notified the investigator in 2008 that he needed\nto change his answer to Question 24. He also said the interview was conducted in a\nroom that was not soundproof and he was in a hurry to finish the interview and that\nresulted in omissions.\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant regrets the \u201cfalsification of information on his\nSecurity Clearance Application Forms\u201d. He stressed that he was embarrassed and that\nhe did eventually admit to the illegal use. He states that he has served his country as a\nfederal employee for almost ten years and as a contractor for over 22 years. He states\nthat he would never jeopardize the security of his country (Item 3). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana in varying amounts and frequency  spanning a\nperiod from 1972 until at least 2006. He also admitted using cocaine. These\ndisqualifying conditions apply in this case.\n\n5\nUnder AG \u00b6 25(g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance\u201d\nis a disqualifying condition. Applicant used marijuana and cocaine after having a\nsecurity clearance. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\npattern of illegal drug use (marijuana or cocaine) consumes a period of 20 years. He\nwas a mature adult when he continued to use illegal drugs. This shows poor judgment\nand lack of trustworthiness given the fact that he had a security clearance during that\ntime. I do not find that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where there is Aa demonstrated intent not\nto abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase for the reasons discussed above.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nUnder the guideline, AG \u00b6 16, describes conditions that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying. Under 16(a) a disqualifying condition exists when\nthere is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d.\nApplicant executed several security clearance applications from 2000 until 2007. He\nnever answered questions pertaining to illegal drug use in the affirmative. He admits\nthat he was embarrassed and did not want to list them. Applicant also spoke to a DoD\ninvestigator and another government interviewer and at first denied any illegal drug use.\nApplicant failed to disclose illegal drug use while holding a security clearance for many\nyears. His behavior and personal conduct are disqualifying as they raise questions\nabout his judgment and reliability and a willingness to comply with the law. \n\n6\nAfter considering the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, I find that none of\nthem apply in this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that they are not\nsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. He served in a professional capacity for his entire career. He has held\nsecret and top secret security clearances. He was considered for SCI in 2007.\nApplicant completed at least four security clearance applications during his years\nof federal government and contractor service spanning 20 years. He deliberately\nomitted information concerning his illegal drug use. He made no attempt to correct his\nfalsifications prior to being confronted. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a-g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \nOn November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines C, foreign preference, and B, foreign influence. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nJuly 31, 2009\n\nSee generally, Hearing Exhibits I-XIII.\n1\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on December 12, 2008, admitting all of the\nallegations and requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009,\nafter having been transferred from another administrative judge. On May 22, a Notice of\nHearing was issued scheduling the case for June 8, 2009. It was held as scheduled. At\nthe hearing, I received two government exhibits, 15 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. The transcript was received on June 16, 2009.\nRuling on Evidence\nDepartment Counsel requested I take administrative notice of the facts set forth\nin 16 exhibits that I marked and identified as Exhibits I through XVI. I took administrative\nnotice of the facts set forth in Exhibits I through XIII, and reserved on those set forth in\nExhibits XIV through XVI. Upon reviewing Exhibits XIV through XVI, I have declined to\ntake administrative notice of their encapsulated facts. The following is a summary of the\nadjudicative facts:\n1. Iran is hostile to the interests of the United States, and the State Department\nhas designated it as a state sponsor of terrorism;\n2. Iran is attempting to acquire weapons of mass destruction;\n3. Iran has an abysmal human rights record. The abuses include summary\nexecutions, lack of fair public trials, arbitrary arrest and detention, and severe\nrestrictions on civil liberties including speech, press assembly, association, movement,\nand privacy; \n4. Iranian security forces have at times monitored the social activities of its\ncitizens, entered homes and offices, monitored phone conversations, and opened mail\nwithout court authorization; and, \n5. Iran provides lethal support to Iraqi militant groups that have targeted U.S.\ntroops and killed innocent Iraqi civilians.1\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old married man with two children, ages 18 and 21.

He was                                                                    \n                             (Tr. 67). After the Revolution, Applicant\u2019s father became a prominent\ndissident (Tr. 71). In 1980, he was imprisoned and executed. That year, the Iranian\ngovernment also executed several other relatives of Applicant,                                          \n                   (Tr. 72). \nApplicant\u2019s mother remarried in 1993 (Tr. 68). Her current husband worked for a\ngovernment customs agency before retiring. Now he performs consulting work for an\nimport/export business (Tr. 64). \nApplicant has an uncle who is an Iranian citizen and resident. He is involved in the\nimport and export of commercial goods, primarily consisting of glass for cars (Tr. 84).\nSeveral years ago, the uncle asked Applicant \u201cif there was an interest, a commercial\ninterest, regarding a technology\u201d (Id.). Applicant contacted his company\u2019s attorney who\ntold him that his company could not conduct business with an Iranian company because\nof the relationship between the two respective governments (Tr. 85). Applicant informed\nhis uncle, and \u201cthat was the end of that\u201d (Id.).\nIn 1979, Applicant voted in an Iranian election through a U.S. consulate office (Tr.\n62). He has not voted in an Iranian election since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2005. In \n\n4\n1979, when visiting Iran, Applicant participated in a protest espousing freedom of the\npress (Tr. 74). He was attacked by government supporters (Id.).\nApplicant continued to protest the Iranian government during the 1980s (Tr. 75).\nIn 1983, a pro-Iranian government militant threatened him during a protest in the U.S.\n(Tr. 90). \nApplicant has visited his family in Iran twice in the past six or seven years (Tr. 86).\nHis most recent trip was in 2004. He used his Iranian passport (Answer). It expired in\n2008. He plans to return in the future. His wife and children have obtained Iranian\npassports in anticipation of their next visit (Exhibit 1 at 19). Applicant intends to renew his\nIranian passport for use in future travel to Iran (Tr. 61). He prefers to travel to Iran with\nhis Iranian passport because \u201cthe current state of relation between [his] country of origin\nand [his] adopted country\u201d would render it nearly impossible to travel to Iran\nexpeditiously in the event of an emergency (Id.). \nApplicant owns no property in Iran. All of his assets are in the U.S. including, but\nnot limited to, a $700,000 life insurance policy (Exhibit L), brokerage accounts\ncollectively valued at $225,000 (Exhibit H), and a $241,000 retirement plan (Exhibit J).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n5\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder this guideline, \u201cwhen an individual acts in such as way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates\u201d (AG \u00b6 9). Applicant\u2019s intent to renew his Iranian passport to travel to Iran in the\nfuture, raises a foreign preference security concern.\nSOR subparagraph 1.d alleges Applicant used an Iranian passport instead of his\nU.S. passport to travel to Iran. Although he used it for travel to Iran, the government did\nnot establish that any of the travel occurred after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nApplicant does not possess a valid Iranian passport. I resolve SOR subparagraph 1.d in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant voted in an Iranian election after immigrating to the U.S. However, he\ndid so more than 20 years ago, before he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 10(a),\n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege, nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member [including] but . . . not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; [and] (7) voting in a foreign\nelection,\u201d does not apply.\nAn applicant\u2019s conduct need not have a sinister motive to be disqualifying under\nGuideline C. Moreover, the negative security significance of acts indicative of a foreign\npreference is not negated or diminished merely because an applicant engages in those\nacts for personal reasons or for personal convenience (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-\n0295 (October 20, 2000) at p. 4; ISCR Case No. 98-0252 (September 15, 1999) at p. 8).\nConsequently, Applicant\u2019s intent to renew his Iranian passport to expedite travel to Iran\nin the event of a family emergency constitutes an example of a foreign preference\nsecurity concern to which AG \u00b6 10(a) applies. \nApplicant intends to continue exercising his dual citizenship to facilitate future\ntravel to Iran. Consequently, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest\u201d (AG \u00b6\n6). \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran, a brutal, totalitarian\ndictatorship that seeks to project its power throughout the Middle East through\nsponsoring terrorists, developing weapons of mass destruction, and undermining civil\nsociety in Iraq. In the 30 years since this Iranian government seized power, it has\nexecuted Applicant\u2019s father and several other relatives. Further, Applicant himself was\nonce attacked for participating in a demonstration in Iran, and he was threatened by a\npro-Iranian government militant during a protest in the U.S. AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is\na citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d applies.\nApplicant is close to his mother, as demonstrated by his refusal to rule out\nrenewing his Iranian passport in the event he needed to visit her during an emergency.\nBecause Iran is hostile to the U.S., Applicant bears a heavy burden to show that his ties\nto his mother do not pose a security risk (see e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09053 (App. Bd.\nFeb 22, 2008) at p. 4).\nBecause Applicant\u2019s mother spends half of her time living in the U.S., the\nopportunity for exploitation is reduced. The possibility of the Iranian government\nexploiting her through her finances is reduced because she is financially independent.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s heavy burden, as described above, these facts are insufficient to\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons,\nthe country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d\nApplicant is an internationally renowned scientist and innovator. He is a pillar of\nhis community, highly active in civic, political, and humanitarian affairs. His wife and\nchildren are native-born U.S. citizens, he has lived in the U.S. for more than 30 years,\nand all of his financial interests are in the U.S. These appear to be the type of ties to the\nU.S. that would be critical in assessing whether AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties, in the U.S. that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d The Appeal Board,\nhowever, has concluded that such ties have little probative value (ISCR Case No. 06-\n25202 (App. Bd. Feb 22, 2008) at p. 6). In the same decision, the Appeal Board also\nreaffirmed precedent pre-dating the 2006 revision to the Guidelines, asserting that what\napplicants would do in a hypothetical situation involving coercion by a foreign power has\nlittle probative value unless such a situation had occurred in the past (Id.). Consequently,\nAG \u00b68(b) applies, but has little security significance.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI have considered the whole person factors in my evaluation of the security\nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s respect for, and promotion of his cultural heritage is commendable,\nas is his close relationship with his mother. I cannot reconcile these positive attributes\nwith the vulnerability to coercion generated by his mother\u2019s Iranian citizenship and\nresidence. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant provided \ninsufficient evidence to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Personal \nconduct concerns are not mitigated because he provided false information to a family \ncourt about the existence of a child of his marriage. The \u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d infra \nat pages 16-18, weighs against eligibility for access to classified information. His \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 1, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF-86) (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1). On March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (GE 10), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and \nF (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 26, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 11). Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on May 19, 2009. On May 27, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me. On June 4, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 9). The hearing \nwas held on June 22, 2009. Department Counsel offered nine exhibits (GE 1-8, 12) \n(Transcript (Tr.) 19, 132-134), and Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 126-128; AE A-B). \nApplicant did not object to consideration of the government exhibits. I admitted GE 1-7 \nand 12 (Tr. 19-20, 132-134). Department Counsel did not object to my consideration of \nAE A-B, and I admitted AE A-B (Tr. 128). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, \nAmended Hearing Notice, SOR, and response to the SOR (GE 8-11). I received the \ntranscript on June 29, 2009. I held the record open until July 6, 2009 (Tr. 108). I \nadmitted an email, dated July 10, 2009, from Department Counsel stating no additional \nevidence beyond AE C and D, had been received from Applicant (AE E). \n \nOn July 2, 2009, I received two post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted \nwithout objection as AE C and D. Department Counsel urged me to give very little \nweight to AE C because the witness making this statement was not subjected to cross-\nexamination. AE C corroborates Applicant\u2019s statements about who submitted his \nresume with an erroneous SSBI date, and Applicant\u2019s lack of involvement in adding the \nerroneous SSBI date. I conclude the statement is not sufficiently important to re-open \nApplicant\u2019s hearing. I find that Applicant was not responsible for furnishing an incorrect \nSSBI date as part of his resume.    \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h \nand 2.a (GE 11). He provided some explanations concerning the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 1.h and 2.a. He also explained why he denied some of the other SOR allegations \n(GE 11). Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 6). He received \na Graduate Equivalency Diploma in 1987 (Tr. 6). He attended college and majored in \ninternational business and security administration; however, he did not complete all \nrequirements for a degree (Tr. 7).

His current employer hired him on June 21, 2008 (Tr. \n153).   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight personal conduct allegations. Seven SOR allegations \ninvolve employment issues involving hiring or termination. Over an eight-year period, \nApplicant left employment with four defense contractors without providing two-weeks\u2019 \nnotice (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g). He was terminated from employment with a \nfederal investigative agency due to unsatisfactory performance (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Another \nfederal agency did not hire him because of discrepancies in his job application and \ninterview (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He quit another job with a defense contractor about four years \nago because of personal problems and his work environment (SOR \u00b6 1.d). One \npersonal conduct allegation was unrelated to employment. He informed a family court \nadjudicating his divorce that there was no child born of his marriage (SOR \u00b6 1.h). These \neight personal conduct concerns receive full elaboration in the remainder of this section.  \n \nEmployment problems \n   \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. In about September 2001, Applicant left employment with S without \nproviding two-weeks\u2019 notice (GE 11). S hired him to be the company\u2019s security \nrepresentative (Tr. 21). He worked for S about ten months (Tr. 23, 25). He quit because \nof a lack of concern at S about lax enforcement of security rules (Tr. 21). He said, \u201c[he] \nwas doing a fabulous job. Unfortunately [he] realized they didn\u2019t really want security\u201d \n(Tr. 32). S had a \u201cparty atmosphere\u201d (Tr. 27). For example, doors to emergency exits \nwere left unsecured (Tr. 21). Applicant was the only employee at S assigned to physical \nsecurity (Tr. 27). He gave a briefing to S\u2019 employees about security, and they treated \nsecurity like it was a joke (Tr. 26). He did not have any documentation that indicated he \ntold S\u2019 management about his security concerns (Tr. 27). He complained about lax \nsecurity to no avail to S\u2019 owners and to the government employee responsible for \nverifying security at S (Tr. 22, 29). He was unhappy about S\u2019 lack of management \nsupport for his concerns (Tr. 30). His complaint to the government employee was oral \nand not written or via email (Tr. 29). He realized the appropriate response was to put his \nconcerns in writing and provide them to the government so that corrective action would \nbe taken (Tr. 30). He was aware of the requirement for two-weeks\u2019 notice (Tr. 23). He \ndid not want to be held responsible if something bad happened at S due to lack of \nsecurity (Tr. 32). He told another government agency that the reason he quit the job at \nS was because he was not given any work to do or he was given insufficient work (Tr. \n112, 113). He did not tell the other agency about the real problem at S because he did \nnot want to convey negative information about a former employer (Tr. 113).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. On November 25, 2003, Applicant was terminated as an investigator \nfrom a federal investigative agency (D) for unacceptable performance (Tr. 32-33, 46; \nGE 11). He was a one-year term, probationary employee, and D dismissed him two \ndays before his one-year term was completed (Tr. 33, 39). When he started at D, he \narrived as a lateral transfer in the grade of GS-11 (Tr. 35). He had a higher grade than \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nother rookie agents, who were generally graded at GS-7 to GS-9 (Tr. 35). Because \nApplicant had a higher grade, much more was expected of him as an investigator than \nfrom the other lower-grade rookie agents (Tr. 35). As a rookie agent, he was hampered \nby a lack of guidance and stable leadership (Tr. 33). His supervisors changed three or \nfour times, and the transitions to new leadership resulted in instability (Tr. 34). He had \ninsufficient support to meet the investigative standards for his grade, GS 11 (Tr. 42). \nApplicant was not happy as an agent because he did not enjoy \u201cgrilling people about \ntheir personal information\u201d (Tr. 34). He was not good at investigating, and preferred \npersonal security and physical security situations (Tr. 38). An additional factor which \nmay have led to his termination was that D was changing missions and needed to \nreduce personnel (Tr. 38). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. In about April 2004, Applicant was not hired for a position at another \nagency (Z) because of concerns about false statements in his employment application \nand interview. Applicant denied that he provided false information to Z (Tr. 39-40, 66; \nGE 11). Z listed six reasons for not hiring him (GE 4 at 11):  \n \n(1) Z alleged he had to be asked three to five times to explain why he left the \nposition with D in November 2003 before he revealed he was terminated (Tr. 41). \nApplicant said he told Z the same reasons expressed in the previous paragraph. He did \nnot reveal that he was terminated because of his performance until directly asked about \ntermination (Tr. 42-43);  \n \n(2) Z alleged Applicant listed on his resume that his job with D ended in \nDecember 2003 (Tr. 46). Applicant agrees his resume contains this information; \nhowever, he indicates his resume was incorrect by only about six days and was not \nintended to mislead (Tr. 46-47);    \n \n \n(3) Z alleged that Applicant listed as his supervisor for reference purposes at D a \nmanager not involved in his termination (Tr. 48). Applicant listed Mr. J, a more senior \nmanager, than Ms. M, the person at D who actually terminated him (Tr. 48). Applicant \nregarded Ms. M as unprofessional and preferred that the reference be from a person \nwho would explain the termination was because of \u201clack of production\u201d (Tr. 49).2 \n \n  \n(4) Z alleged that D\u2019s separation letter supported Z\u2019s decision not to hire \nApplicant because the positions at Z and D were comparable. Applicant disagreed, \narguing his position at D was as an investigator, and the proposed position at D was as \na personal security specialist (Tr. 50). \n \n \n(5) Z alleged that Applicant\u2019s resume had an incorrect and more recent SSBI \ndate on the first page (in 2004) than was accurate (Tr. 50). His actual SSBI was in 2001 \n(Tr. 51). He called someone on the telephone with access to his email account, and he \n \n2 A memorandum from Ms. M describes the extensive efforts she made to train Applicant to be a \nprofessional investigator. She intensely managed his time management and actions during the work day. \nShe indicated the quality and quantity of his work did not improve, despite her individual mentoring (GE 4 \nat 13). \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nasked her (Ms. E) to add some information about his work for D to his resume and then \nto send the resume to Z (Tr. 55-57; AE C). Applicant said Ms. E signed and submitted \nthe cover letter with his resume with an incorrect SSBI date (Tr. 51-59, 67-68; GE 4 at \n15-17; AE C). Ms. E, Applicant\u2019s close friend, made the change to his resume \nconcerning his SSBI date without Applicant seeing the change (Tr. 54, 68). Ms. E \n\u201cspruced up his resume a bit\u201d without his advising Ms. E to do so (Tr. 69-70). He \nthought Ms. E guessed that his SSBI had been updated (Tr. 69). The last page of his \nresume indicates, \u201cCurrent Top Secret Security Background Investigation 3/8/01\u201d (GE 4 \nat 18). The original resume Applicant submitted has his correct SSBI date (Tr. 53). Ms. \nE provided a post-hearing affidavit corroborating Applicant\u2019s account about Ms. E \nhaving his permission to sign his name and that Ms. E guessed the date of his SSBI \nand filed his resume (AE C). Department Counsel did not have an opportunity to cross-\nexamine Ms. E. \n \n \n(6) Z alleged that Applicant\u2019s resume had an incorrect description of his status at \nD (Tr. 62). His resume said he had \u201cterm employment\u201d with D, and in reality it was a \nVeterans Administration (VA) Readjustment Appointment type of employment (Tr. 62).  \nHis resume said on page one, \u201cEligible for Federal Government employment under 10-\npoint, 30% Disabled Veteran\u2019s Preference\u201d (GE 4 at 16). Applicant was unsure whether \nhe actually received the 10-point VA preference when D hired him (Tr. 64). He did not \nremember whether he filed documentation with his application for hiring with D \nestablishing his 10-point VA preference (Tr. 64-65).   \n    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. In about August 2005, Applicant left employment with C after \nproviding two weeks notice due to personal problems and a hostile work environment \n(Tr. 71-72; GE 11). He had lost his previous position because he married a foreign \nnational (his marriage was incompatible with maintenance of his continued access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI)) (Tr. 72). His supervisor had a medical \nproblem, was frequently angry, and said she was thinking about quitting (Tr. 72-74). \nAlso, Applicant was having marital difficulty (Tr. 72-73). His supervisor quit, and \nApplicant\u2019s responsibilities were increased (Tr. 73-74). He believed he was doing a \ngreat job (Tr. 75). However, he could not handle the stress of performing his own duties \nand some of the duties of his supervisor (Tr. 74-75). He gave two-weeks\u2019 notice and quit \n(Tr. 75).    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. In about January 2006 after several months of employment with (E), \nApplicant quit (Tr. 76-77; GE 11). He did not provide two-weeks\u2019 notice to his employer \n(Tr. 76). He cited personal issues involving his wife\u2019s departure from his residence, and \nhis belief another employee was treated unfairly as his reasons for quitting (Tr. 76). He \nwas angry about replacing another employee who was being fired because he believed \nthe employee he would be replacing was doing an excellent job (Tr. 76-79). He did not \nbelieve the other employee deserved to be replaced (Tr. 76-79). He told management \nthat he would quit, unless they promised not to fire the other employee (Tr. 77-78). Still, \nmanagement advised Applicant that the other employee was going to be fired. Applicant \nquit, and the other employee was subsequently fired (Tr. 77-80).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. In about January 2006, Applicant left employment with R without \nproviding two-weeks\u2019 notice (Tr. 81; GE 11). R hired Applicant after he quit his \nemployment with E (Tr. 82). He found out R was hiring him to replace another \nemployee, and he decided to quit (Tr. 82). He explained why he believed it was his duty \nto quit without providing two-weeks\u2019 notice (Tr. 83-91). He said, \u201cI have a certain moral \nintegrity that\u2019s not going to allow me to sit there and take someone\u2019s job if they\u2019re doing \na good job\u201d (Tr. 82). R did not deserve two-weeks\u2019 notice (Tr. 83). He did not want to be \nused, \u201cas a henchman to sit next to them while they bring me up to speed and train me \nfor the job they want me to do and they\u2019re going to fire this person? I refuse to accept \nthat\u201d (Tr. 83). The employee being fired was not aware of her employer\u2019s plan to fire her \n(Tr. 84). He considered both E and R to be disloyal to their employees (Tr. 88). He did \nnot respect E and R (Tr. 88). Loyalty to employees is a two-way street (Tr. 88). He \nwould be loyal to an employer, who was loyal to their employees (Tr. 88). Additionally, \nhe was not aware of a rule that required two weeks\u2019 notice (Tr. 83). He believed it was \nmore of a standard courtesy (Tr. 83). If it happens again in the future, he would leave \nwithout giving two-weeks\u2019 notice (Tr. 89). He rationalized that \u201csometimes rules are \nmeant to be broken, and this is one rule that has to be broken because they were not \ndoing things correct[ly]\u201d (Tr. 91). He expressed some fear of returning hostile employees \nwho might put him in the line of fire if he seemed to be part of the scheme to fire and \nreplace the employee (Tr. 91).     \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. In about September 2006 after having a personality conflict with the \ncompany owner, Applicant left employment with D without providing two-weeks\u2019 notice \n(Tr. 91). He was a consultant and believed he was not required to provide any notice \nbefore quitting (Tr. 92). He thought the owner was \u201ctotally unprofessional\u201d and did not \ndeserve notice before he quit (Tr. 92-93).  \n \nPaternity information provided to family court  \n \nIn 2008 during his divorce proceedings, Applicant did not disclose that a child \nwas born of his marriage (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. 93). He married in June 2005 in the United \nStates (GE 2 at 16). His divorce was final in June 2008 (GE 2 at 16-17). The final \ndivorce decree states, \u201cno children were born or adopted of this marriage\u201d (GE 2 at 16). \nApplicant said he did not disclose to the court that he had a child of his marriage \nbecause he was unsure of paternity (Tr. 94). Applicant\u2019s spouse left his home in August \n2005 because he was having financial problems due to unemployment (Tr. 94-96). She \ninformed him that she was pregnant in November or December 2005 (Tr. 94-96). She \nleft the United States in January 2006 (Tr. 94). Her child was born in March, 2006 in the \nPhilippines (Tr. 95). Applicant went to the Philippines and was present at her birth (Tr. \n98-99). He wanted to take care of the child, even if she was not his daughter, because \nhe loved his wife (Tr. 97). He told the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator that she was his daughter (Tr. 98). However, he told the family court in a \ndocument that no children were born or adopted of this marriage (Tr. 98; GE 2 at 17).  \n \nApplicant was reluctant to inform the family court that he was the father of the \nchild born of his spouse. He was suspicious that his wife might have become pregnant \nfrom an ex-boyfriend who lived near her when she left Applicant in August 2005 (Tr. 99). \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nHe did not want to tell a court that she was his daughter without proof of paternity (Tr. \n99). He did not know the rules and laws and did not have paperwork proving paternity \nand did not know that he should have asked the court to resolve the paternity issue (Tr. \n100). Applicant\u2019s ex-wife is now in China (Tr. 100). The baby lives with her maternal \ngrandmother (Tr. 101). He asserted that claiming her as his child would raise issues \nwith the IRS about claiming a dependent and head of household status (Tr. 103-104). \n \nApplicant said he was paying support to the baby\u2019s maternal grandmother (Tr. \n101). He made the following payments: August 24, 2006 ($200); September 2006 \n($100); October 2006 ($100); December 2006 ($300); March 16, 2007 ($140); April 13, \n2007 ($100); May 9, 2007 ($155); June 9, 2007 ($200); January 10, 2008 ($300); April \n9, 2008 ($100); May 9, 2008 ($200); May 15, 2008 ($350); May 2009 ($300) (Tr. 102, \n105-107). He said he sends money continuously on a regular basis (Tr. 102). He said \nthere were payments every month in 2009 (Tr. 108). I held the record open until July 6, \n2009, for the rest of the payment records (Tr. 108). However, no records showing \nadditional child support payments were presented after his hearing.  \n \nApplicant said he made the payments out of a sense of duty and to ease his \nconscience about being responsible for his former spouse\u2019s daughter (Tr. 108). He \ninvited his former spouse to return to the United States and promised to sponsor her \nand support her financially; however, she has chosen to remain in China (Tr. 111).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and five delinquent debts, totaling \n$19,239. He petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in about December 2001. The \nbankruptcy court discharged his unsecured debts in about April 2002 (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Tr. \n114). About $37,000 in debt was discharged in this bankruptcy (Tr. 115-116; GE 5 at \n11). He attributed his financial problems to changing or quitting jobs (Tr. 116).  \n \n \nTwo paid SOR debts. Applicant paid his judgment relating to a debt of $1,473 \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) on October 11, 2008, Applicant paid $421, resolving the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b \n(Tr. 117-120, 135; GE 11 at 2). Applicant paid his debt of $850 on a collection account \n(SOR \u00b6 2.d) on January 17, 2009 (Tr. 117; GE 11 at 1).  \n \n \nOne SOR debt in payment plan. Applicant owes $1,142 on a collection account \nfor the purchase of exercise equipment (SOR \u00b6 2.c; Tr. 121; GE 6; GE 7 at 1). He is \nmaking periodic payments of $50 (Tr. 121-125, 129-134). I requested that he provide \ndocumentation after his hearing showing payments to this creditor (Tr. 131). Applicant \nprovided documentation showing $50 monthly payments for at least six months, \nreducing the debt to $1,212 as of May 27, 2009 (AE D).     \n  \n \nTwo insufficiently resolved SOR debts. Applicant owes about $6,000 on a \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 2.e; Tr. 137; GE 6 at 2). In his SOR response, Applicant said, \n\u201cI deny: the [SOR \u00b6 2.e] account is being paid as arranged by creditor\u201d (GE 11). At his \nhearing, he asserted, that he is resolving this debt with a payment plan (Tr. 135-137, \n143; AE A at 3). As part of his SOR response, he provided a letter, dated February 16, \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n2009, from the creditor indicating the amount owed was $6,892 (GE 11 at 3). He \ncrossed off the amount owed and wrote $4,763 (GE 11 at 3). The following exchange \noccurred between Department Counsel and Applicant concerning the balance owed, \nand payments made: \n \nDepartment Counsel: The balance on this account is not listed on [AE A at \n3]. Do you know what the balance is? \n \nApplicant: It\u2019s hard to answer that question because when I asked this \ncollection company the balance it seems like they change it and it doesn\u2019t \nmake sense what\u2019s occurring with the account.  \n \nDepartment Counsel: Okay. \n \nApplicant: But I just cooperate so they don\u2019t continue saying I\u2019m not \nmaking payments. And it seems like the minimum is never going down is \nwhat I\u2019m trying to express there, but I just make the payments so it doesn\u2019t \nfurther reflect that I\u2019m trying not to cooperate with them.  \n \nDepartment Counsel: What type of payments do you make or have you \nbeen making? \n \nApplicant: I give them $200 every month, $200 a month. \n \nDepartment Counsel: Since when? \n \nApplicant: It\u2019s been going on for quite some time now. This debt has been \ngoing on for a year or so, a year or two years, maybe longer than that. \n \n(emphasis added)(Tr. 136-137). Later at Applicant\u2019s hearing, Department Counsel \nreturned to the issue of when he made his payment plan with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 2.e \n(Tr. 153). Applicant said that he could not recall when he reached the payment \narrangement with this creditor (Tr. 153).  He said he was making the payments since \nlast year or the year before (Tr. 155). He concluded, \u201cThey\u2019re all getting their money \nevery month\u201d (Tr. 155).    \n \n \nApplicant owes about $8,500 on a collection account for a repossessed vehicle \n(SOR \u00b6 2.f; Tr. 138-143; AE A at 5; GE 2 at 2). He was making payments in 2008, and \nthen stopped when he learned the account was transferred (Tr. 139-140). The \nagreement is to make monthly payments of $300 (Tr. 140). On May 11, 2009, he made \na $300 payment (Tr. 139; AE A at 5). He said he is cooperating and giving them money \n(Tr. 155). He intends to continue to make payments (Tr. 142).  \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling and learned that he was not living beyond \nhis means (Tr. 156). He prepared a budget (Tr. 157). The financial counselor advised \nhim to make more than the minimum payments on his debts and to reduce his interest \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npayments (Tr. 156, 158). His goal was to pay off his creditors and reduce his interest \npayments on his outstanding debts (Tr. 156).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s take home monthly pay is $3,914 (Tr. 146). He also receives $453 \nfrom the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) because of a service-connected disability (Tr. \n146). Applicant is making payments on two credit cards as agreed (Tr. 144; AE A at 10-\n11). His balance on one card is $475, and his balance on the other card is $650 (AE A \nat 10-11). His monthly rent is $1,514 (Tr. 146). His rent is current and has never been \ndelinquent over the last seven years (Tr. 145). He does not own or lease a vehicle (Tr. \n146). He pays all of his bills on time (Tr. 148).   \n \n \nI requested that Applicant provide proof that he had made the payments on his \nSOR debts for the first six months of 2009 (Tr. 148-149). Applicant said he understood \nthe requirement (Tr. 148-149). The record was kept open until July 6, 2009 (Tr. 161, \n166). I did not receive the documentation I requested showing payments to the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f for the period January through June 2009. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common- \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and F (Financial Considerations).  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case in regard to providing the SOR allegations: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; and \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \nThe SOR alleges eight personal conduct allegations. Seven SOR allegations \ninvolve employment issues involving hiring or termination. Over an eight-year period, \nApplicant left employment with four defense contractors without providing two-weeks\u2019 \nnotice (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g).3 He was terminated from employment with a \n \n3 One of the four jobs he left without providing two-weeks\u2019 notice was his employment as a \nconsultant. There is no reason to believe two-weeks notice is required even as a courtesy for a \nconsultant. As such, only three of the four times he quit his jobs is cited in the \u201cWhole Person Concept,\u201d \ninfra.   \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nfederal investigative agency due to unsatisfactory performance (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Another \nfederal agency did not hire him because of discrepancies in his job application and \ninterview (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He quit another job with a defense contractor about four years \nago because of personal problems and his work environment (SOR \u00b6 1.d). One \npersonal conduct allegation was unrelated to employment. He informed a family court \nadjudicating his divorce that there was no child born of his marriage (SOR \u00b6 1.h).   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(1) both apply because the record contains substantial \nevidence that Applicant engaged in a variety of decisions and actions showing \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \nand \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3), 16(e) and 16(f) do not apply. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) does not apply \nbecause it is unclear whether there is a rule precluding leaving employment without two \nweeks\u2019 notice. Applicant was forthcoming at his hearing about his reasons for quitting \nhis jobs. He is proud of his decisions to quit jobs based on his ideals and principles. The \ngovernment is well-aware of his former wife\u2019s daughter, who is living in the Philippines. \nHe is not subject to exploitation or pressure because of the conduct alleged in the SOR. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has violated a written or recorded commitment to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. If there is a written commitment to provide \ntwo weeks\u2019 notice, that documentation is not part of the record evidence in this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f) apply to the federal agency\u2019s decision not to hire Applicant \nbecause of discrepancies in his job application and interview (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant \nfiled a resume which made it very clear he had a veteran\u2019s 10-point preference. It is a \ncommon practice to list a supervisor on a resume who will provide positive comments \nabout performance, and not to list any supervisors, who might make negative comments \nabout performance. The other disputed information, such as when his SSBI was \ncompleted, is controverted and/or too minor to raise a security concern.  \n \nApplicant left one job after providing two-weeks\u2019 notice (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He quit \nanother job as a consultant without providing two-weeks\u2019 notice (SOR \u00b6 1.g). There is \nno reason to believe a consultant should have to provide two-weeks\u2019 notice. \n \nOver an eight-year period, Applicant left employment with three defense \ncontractors without providing two-weeks\u2019 notice (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e and 1.f). He was \nterminated from employment with a federal investigative agency due to unsatisfactory \nperformance (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under AG 16(d)(1) this conduct is somewhat \u201cuntrustworthy \nor unreliable behavior.\u201d When he left employment without providing notice, he caused \nproblems for his employers. His work in security is essential to his employer\u2019s safety \nand effectiveness. Employees should not negligently or intentionally cause gaps where \nno security expertise is available to protect national security. His oral statement makes it \nclear that he did not care whether his abrupt, voluntary departure from employment had \nan adverse impact on his employer.  \n \nHowever, there is insufficient evidence in the record of a requirement to provide \ntwo weeks\u2019 notice. The letter from Ms. M describes his dereliction of duty in general \nterms. Ms. M does not describe particular days when Applicant failed to perform his \ninvestigative responsibilities and his response, if any to her counseling and mentoring \nsessions. See n. 2, supra and GE 4 at 13. I conclude that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f \nare mitigated applying SOR \u00b6 17(f). Nevertheless, these four SOR factual allegations \nare relevant for further consideration in the Whole Person Concept, at pages 16-18, \ninfra. \n \nOne personal conduct allegation was unrelated to employment. Applicant \ninformed a family court adjudicating his divorce that there was no child born of his \nmarriage (SOR \u00b6 1.h). This was not true. He said she was his daughter (GE 2 at 4). \nNow, he says he is unsure of paternity (Tr. 99-100). He was present in the Philippines \nwhen his spouse\u2019s daughter was born (Tr. 98). I do not find his explanation about tax \nconcerns to be credible. He provided evidence of four payments to support his spouse\u2019s \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndaughter in 2006, four payments in 2007, four payments in 2008, and one payment in \n2009. In the last 12 months (June 2008 to June 2009), he has only provided proof of \npayment of $300 in child support. I am confident the family court would have ordered \nsubstantially more child support, unless he provided proof that he was not the child\u2019s \nfather, which Applicant does not have. The false information he provided the family \ncourt resulted in his avoidance of a substantial potential legal requirement to pay child \nsupport until the child reaches the age of 18 and perhaps even longer. As such, his \nfalse court filing is a material, deliberate and intentional breach of integrity and honesty \nthat has significant, adverse long-term implications for his former spouse and her child. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and, \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n.  .  . delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debt is documented in his bankruptcy schedules, his credit reports, his SOR \nresponse and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were \npaid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n  \n   \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit because his \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur,\u201d \nassuming he will not have the same unemployment problems he has experienced in the \nlast eight years. However, the problem of about $14,000 in unresolved debt continues to \n\u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial problems \ninitially resulted from his periods of unemployment or underemployment. He does not \nreceive full mitigating credit because he did not establish that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling as part of his \nbankruptcy. However, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control\u201d because two debts totaling over $14,000 are insufficiently resolved. \nHe has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), because he \nshowed some good faith4 in the resolution of his SOR debts. He paid the two debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.d. He established a solid track record of making payments on the \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 2.c. He does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he did not \nestablish that he is making meaningful progress resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and \n2.f. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant did not provide documentation contesting \nthe validity of any debts.5  \n \nI will briefly provide an additional explanation of my reasons for not mitigating the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f in the Formal Findings section of this decision. \nApplicant owes about $14,000 on these two debts. He said he has been making \npayments for many months on these accounts. He was especially clear that he has \nbeen making $200 monthly payments for a lengthy period of time on the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n2.e. However, he provided proof of only one payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.e. He was \nspecifically asked for supporting documentation to corroborate his claim that he was \nmaking monthly payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and he did not provide the \nrequested documentation. I conclude that he was not accurate in his claim of such \npayments.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant said he was making payments on two \nlarge debts, and he was told of the necessity for supporting documentation. He did not \nprovide the requested proof to establish his track record of debt payments. I am not \nconfident he will pay these two debts because of his lack of meaningful progress on the \nresolution of these two debts.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is important to consider; \nhowever, it is insufficient to warrant reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation(s). He is generally a law-abiding citizen \n(the only potential criminal offense is his false filing with the family court concerning his \nspouse\u2019s daughter\u2019s birth during their marriage). His current financial problems were \npartially caused by some factors partially or fully beyond his control: (1) insufficient \nincome, (2) unemployment, and (3) underemployment. He paid two debts and \nsufficiently resolved another SOR debt through an established payment plan. His \nbankruptcy is not recent. He has paid some child support. He promised to pay his debts.   \n \nApplicant has achieved some important educational and employment goals, \ndemonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. He completed high \nschool and earned some college credits. Some of his employment history and \ncontributions to defense contractors speak well for his character. He understands how \nto budget and what he needs to do to establish his financial responsibility. Applicant has \ndemonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through his service in the U.S. \nMarine Corps. These factors, especially his past government service, show substantial \nresponsibility.   \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. He has \na history of financial problems as indicated by his 2001 bankruptcy and his subsequent \ndelinquent debts. He failed to establish that he made sufficient effort to address two \nlarge delinquent debts. Ultimately, he did not establish that he acted with sufficient effort \nand self-discipline to resolve his delinquent debts and/or to better document his \nremedial efforts.  \n \nOver an eight-year period, Applicant left employment with three defense \ncontractors without providing two-weeks\u2019 notice. When he left employment without \nproviding notice, he caused problems for his employers. His oral statement at his \nhearing makes it clear that he did not care whether his abrupt terminations had an \nadverse impact on his employers. He was terminated from employment with a federal \ninvestigative agency due to unsatisfactory performance. His failure to adequately \nperform his investigative missions was at least in part due to his reluctance to ask \nsearching questions of persons he was interviewing. Part of being a security clearance \nholder is to sometimes make tough personnel decisions to protect national security. \nApplicant seems to be unwilling to make difficult decisions that adversely affect people. \nHis negative job performance was generally documented by his supervisor, Ms. M. His \nperformance at the investigative agency raises some reliability and trustworthiness \nconcerns. \n \n\n \n18 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant filed a false document with a family court, raising serious integrity and \ntrustworthiness concerns. He informed a family court adjudicating his divorce that there \nwas no child born of his marriage. This was not true. I do not find his explanation about \ntax concerns to be credible. He provided evidence of four payments to support his \ndaughter in 2006, four payments in 2007, four payments in 2008, and one payment in \n2009. Absent proof that the child born of his marriage was not his child, the court would \nhave ordered monthly payments (or deferred to a Philippine Court to resolve the \ndivorce). Most likely, Applicant would have had to pay more to support his wife\u2019s \ndaughter than he has paid to support her. He avoided a substantial risk of greater child \nsupport payments by telling the court that no child was born of their marriage. At this \ntime there is no legal reason why Applicant could not stop making any payments \nwhatsoever to support this child, who is presumptively his daughter (under most state \nlaws). He has almost stopped making payments, as he has only paid $300 in the last 12 \nmonths (June 2008 to June 2009). \n \nAll the factors considered together show too much financial irresponsibility and \nlack of judgment. His history of delinquent debt raises unmitigated security concerns.   \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nsufficiently mitigated personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not fully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE E:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.g: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nPARAGRAPH 2, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.d: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.e and 2.f: \n Against Applicant \n\n \n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

On October 7, 2008, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) citing to\nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nIn a response notarized on December 5, 2008, Applicant constructively admitted\nthree of the seven allegations regarding finances. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s request\nto have the matter heard before an Administrative Judge and I was assigned the case\non January 13, 2009. Applicant and Department Counsel agreed to a hearing date of\nFebruary 4, 2009. A Notice of Hearing to that effect was issued on January 16, 2009. \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n Tr. 65.\n1\n Tr. 14.\n2\n2\nThe hearing was timely convened. During the hearing, Department Counsel\nintroduced five documents, which were admitted into the record as exhibits (Exs.) 1-5\nwithout objection. Applicant introduced two documents, admitted into the record as Exs.\nA-C without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf; no witnesses appeared.\nApplicant was given through February 16, 2009, to forward any additional information.\nFour documents were timely delivered to Department Counsel by Applicant for review\nand were then forwarded to me on February 18, 2009. They were admitted into the\nrecord as Exs. D-G without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 19,\n2009, and the record was closed. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and\ntestimony, security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old network administrator who has worked for the same\ngovernment contractor for over a year. He has a high school diploma and an\nassociate\u2019s degree in computer networking. He is married and has three young\nchildren.\nIn October 1995, shortly after divorcing his first wife, Applicant began active duty\nservice in the United States Army. In 1996, he married his current wife, who had two\nsmall children from a previous marriage. The newlyweds experienced some financial\ndifficulties. They were not allowed to live on-post, necessitating a high priced local\nrental property. In 1997, a son was born. Meanwhile, problems related to his recent\ndivorce persisted. For example, it was agreed his ex-wife would keep their car and\nmake payments on it. Instead, she defaulted on the payments and creditors began to\npursue him. In addition, a hip injury unexpectedly forced Applicant to take an honorable\nmedical discharge in October 2008. \nAfter a brief period of unemployment lasting a couple of weeks, Applicant found\ncivilian employment in a large and costly metropolitan area. Although he was happy\nwith the employment, he found his salary was insufficient to support a family of five in\nthat region. Bills eventually went unpaid or were paid late. In September 1999,\nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. It included debts from his first\nmarriage and their separation.  He received a discharge in April 2000. Relieved of his\n1\npast debt, Applicant was ready to start anew. His employer, however, was forced to file\nfor bankruptcy in October 2000. As a result, Applicant found himself without a job and,\nconsequently,  without an income.2\nIn mid-December 2000, Applicant was hired in a less expensive region in a\nneighboring state. Things were looking up until the terrorist attacks of September 11,\n2001. Within a week, a quarter of his company\u2019s employees were laid off, including\nApplicant. He filed for unemployment with the state that month and continued on state\n\n Ex. 1 (SF-86) at 17/40.\n3\n Id. at 15-17/40.\n4\n Exs.

As he looked for work, the entire telecommunications\n3\nindustry began to decline. He resorted to work as a security officer in September 2002,\nthen added a second job as a technician for an information sciences entity in December\n2002.  \n4\nDuring the summer of 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife faced an intolerable work\nenvironment at the medical office where she worked. She gave two weeks notice of her\nintention to quit. On her last day, Applicant learned his technical employer was being\ntaken over by a larger entity. He then was laid off. Realizing his area of expertise was in\nflux, Applicant decided to utilize his GI Bill benefits and continue his education.\nAlthough he received some parental assistance and his landlords agreed to work with\nhim, some bills were paid late, new debts accrued, and state taxes went unpaid. State\nliens were obtained against him for non-payment of state taxes in the amounts of about\n$1,999, $268, and $2,866, but they were ultimately satisfied in May 2005.  Applicant\n5\nbelieves all three liens were for the same tax year.  His federal taxes have been\n6\nregularly paid. \nWhile attending school full time, Applicant did some \u201cwork on the side.\u201d  At the\n7\nurging of a friend, he filed for unemployment in August 2005 after circumstances\ndiverted the  need for his services from the area. The state discovered he had been let\ngo from his prior employment and was pursuing his education. Consequently, he was\nfound ineligible for unemployment for the reasons he had cited, but by that point he had\nalready received financial assistance from the state.     \n8\nIn May 2006, Applicant graduated with honors. He was unable to find\nemployment until September 2006. Applicant left that employer for his current position\nin November 2007. He completed an e-QIP in December 2007. Sometime around\nFebruary 2008, he retained a law firm to help straighten out his credit.  He received the\n9\nSOR at issue in this proceeding in October 2008.\nOf concern in the SOR are six delinquent accounts that emerged following\nApplicant\u2019s April 2000 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. \n\n Tr. 46. \n10\n Tr. 49-51.\n11\n Id.\n12\n Tr. 47.\n13\n Tr. 51.\n14\n Id.\n15\n Id.; Tr. 52.\n16\n Ex.

The account is for urgent care services rendered to Applicant\nwhen he was unemployed and had no insurance. The claim should have been\nprocessed through his wife\u2019s health insurance policy.  He discovered it was on his\n10\ncredit report in December 2007, after he completed the e-QIP but before he met with\ninvestigators. He believes his wife paid the balance at that time.  Applicant stated he\n11\nhas disputed this account\u2019s continued entry,  but presented no documentation\n12\nregarding the current status of this account before the record was closed.  There is no\n13\nevidence of payment.\nUTILITIES ACCOUNT placed for collection in about August 2003 for approximately\n$255. (SOR allegation 1.c). Applicant admits this bill is his, but thought the balance was\npaid.  After disputing the account, he discovered it was from a different residence than\n14\nhe had previously thought.  It was from their residence during his post-911 period of\n15\nunemployment. He thought this bill had been paid at the time by his wife. He is hoping\nto pay the balance at the end of the month, but could not make payment before the\nrecord was closed.16\nSTATE TAX LIEN filed against Applicant in March 2005 for approximately $1,999.\n(SOR allegation 1.d).

He maintains that he \u201cnever had a car that was\nfor $30,000 and got it taken away.\u201d  He stated: \u201cThe only car maybe that got\n19\nrepossessed like that was whenever I had a bankruptcy.

Applicant recalls a vehicle being part of the\nbankruptcy.  He has received no correspondence regarding the sale of a repossessed\n21\ncar. The auto loan account was a joint account. According to the credit report, the\naccount was opened in August 2000 and last reported as delinquent in April 2001. The\nmethod of payment for the account is noted as \u201crepossession\u201d after the account\nbecame $1,463 past due. The credit report states \u201cRepossession; There may be\nbalance due; Repossession; Last reported delinquencies: 04/2001=1.\u201d . The date of\n22\nlast activity noted on the December 2007 credit report is April 2001.\nSTATE TAX LIEN filed against Applicant in May 2006 for approximately $3,004. (SOR\nallegation 1.g) for unemployment benefits received while ineligible.  In partial\n23\nrepayment, as shown by transacted check, dated September 16, 2008, for $150.24\nApplicant says he is \u201ctrying to find other check stubs\u201d to prove other payments, but\nproduced no other evidence of other payments before the record closed.25\nCurrently, Applicant is living within his means. He has two cars but no car\npayments, and insurance for the family is about $200 a month. He spends about $300\na month for the family\u2019s gasoline. The family\u2019s rent is $725 a month.  Utilities run about\n26\n$300-$350, phone charges average about $125, and cable costs about $70 a month.\nGroceries cost about $700 a month. His stepson is about to reach his majority and will\nsoon be independent, thus lowering some related charges, such as car insurance. \nApplicant has four credit cards. Two have no current balance, the other two have\nbalances of $400 and $200, respectively. He makes $50 payments on the cards per\nmonth. The family\u2019s regular group activity costs about $125 a month.  In sum, monthly\n27\nexpenses run about $2,600 per month.  That amount is paid through the joint account\n28\nof Applicant and his wife, who, as a couple, net about $4,000 per month.  The couple\n29\n\n Tr. 43.\n30\n Ex.

It is reserved for unexpected expenses and emergencies. \n30\nApplicant is currently pursuing credit counseling.  This should complement his\n31\nwork with his credit repair law firm, which he feels is failing to pursue his case in an\neffective manner.  He regrets retaining that firm as he thought these matters would\n32\nhave been resolved by now. It is his hope to resolve his final issues so he can\ncontemplate a home purchase or start a computer business with a friend.  He is\n33\ncommitted to resolving any past debt in order to move on with his life with his integrity\nand patriotism unquestioned.34\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n35\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n36\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n37\n Id.\n38\n Id.\n39\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n40\n7\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n35\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n36\n37\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n38\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n39\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n40\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGUIDELINE F\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\n\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n41\n8\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions\n41\nunder this guideline.  \nApplicant faced significant periods of unemployment from September 2001 to\nOctober 2002 and May 2006 through September 2006. During those times and other\nperiods of intermittent employment, some accounts became delinquent. Although the\nmajority of those accounts now at issue (e.g., two state tax liens, a medical account,\nand a utilities bill) were unintentionally overlooked, the number of delinquent bills was\nmultiple and over half remain unpaid. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) apply\nwith regard to SOR allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. With such conditions raised,\nthe burden shifts to Appellant to overcome the case against him and mitigate security\nconcerns. \nAs a preliminary matter, however, the Government failed to present sufficient\nevidence establishing SOR allegation 1.f, a $30,000 car loan liability. The credit report\nintroduced as Ex. 4 (Credit Report, dated December 12, 2007) is inconclusive. It\nreflects a car loan for a car possessed by Applicant from only August 2000 through\nApril 2001. It shows an account with a past due amount in 2001 of approximately\n$1,500 on a car loan with a balance of $30,000. It explicitly notes that the method of\npayment on the account was repossession. There is no indication of a post-\nrepossession auction, post-resale balance for the car, or any indication as to whether\nthe repossession satisfied any portion of Applicant\u2019s original loan balance on the car.\nInstead, it equivocally notes: \u201cThere may be a balance due.\u201d Moreover, the account\nremained on his credit report merely as a past due entry from 2001 with no adjustments\nas to any balance owed on the account through 2008, a more than sufficient interval for\nthe creditor to have established an adjusted balance owed, if any, after auction.\nConsequently, the credit report provides evidence of a past due account which led to a\nrepossession and a past due balance. It does not establish a $30,000 debt.\nAs for the other accounts noted, the medical account went unpaid because\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s insurer neglected or chose not to process his claim for medical urgent\ncare while he was uninsured and unemployed. The remainder of the accounts became\ndelinquent through Applicant\u2019s inability to maintain employment in a faltering industry.\nConsequently, with regard to this debt, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\n(FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies.\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s erratic employment history since 2000 mirrors the erratic nature of\nthe technological industry over the past nine years. The \u201cdot.com\u201d bubble burst circa\n2000, the impact of 911, and the restructuring of many tech companies mid-decade\nstagnated growth and hindered employment for individuals such as Applicant. To cope\nthrough this period of transition, Applicant returned to school and resorted to working\noutside his field while his industry reformed. With his industry now in a less feverish\nlevel of reorganization, Applicant has a stable job as well as additional educational\ncredentials and experience should his industry again undergo change. Consequently,\nFC MC \u00b6 AG 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). \nApplicant sought assistance from a credit repair law firm and is currently\nreceiving financial counseling. He satisfied his two state tax liens in 2006 (SOR\nallegations 1.d and 1.e), a total sum amounting to about $2,500. He also provided\nevidence that some repayment efforts toward his unemployment overpayment were\nmade (SOR allegation 1.g). Although he failed to provide evidence of payment for the\nminor utilities and medical bills (SOR allegations 1.b and 1.c), he credibly testified one\nwas previously paid and the other would be paid within a few weeks. While a promise to\npay in the future has little weight in these proceedings, the sum at issue is a\nmanageable amount of about $400, not so large a sum to raise serious security\nconcerns. Given the efforts thus far expended, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts\u201d) apply. None of the other mitigating conditions, however, apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature and articulate man who was genuinely blind-sided by the\nexistence of the debts at issue. No sooner had he gotten back on track financially after\n\n10\na messy divorce through a September 1999 bankruptcy discharge, his industry began\nits own downward trend. Consequently, from 2000 through 2007, his employment was\nerratic and seldom secure, with protracted periods of unemployment such as from\nSeptember 2001 to October 2002 and May through September 2006. To increase his\nattractiveness to employers and gain a competitive edge during a time of industry\nturmoil, he returned to school and earned a degree. Today, he has emerged from his\nindustry\u2019s turmoil with a steady job and earns sufficient income to meet his needs.\nDuring that time of flux, however, Applicant acquired some delinquent debt. This\nacquisition was largely the result of oversight, not neglect or intentional avoidance.\nAbout $2,500 owed for state taxes in 2005 was paid in 2006. Some progress has been\nmade toward an unemployment compensation overpayment and Applicant is resolved\nto see that balance satisfied. Remaining is only about $400 toward a medical and a\nutility bill, both of which Applicant acknowledges and of which he testified proof of\npayment would be forthcoming, but could not be located before the record closed.\nRegardless, $400 is not so great a sum as to seriously sustain security concerns.\nMoreover, after he completes the financial counseling he is now pursuing, Applicant\nshould be better prepared to handle his finances pro-actively in the future. With security\nconcerns thus mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 2, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On November 3, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n \n1  GE 2. \n \nApril 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn November 24, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 7, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on February 2, 2009. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection (Tr. 21). Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and presented two witnesses and Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 20, which were admitted without objection.3 DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 10, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior test engineer working for a defense contractor. \nIn October 1986, after graduating from high school, he joined the U.S. Navy. He served \nhonorably on active duty during 20 years. He achieved the grade of E-6, and was \nhonorably retired in October 2006. While in the Navy, Applicant had access to classified \ninformation at the secret and top secret levels. After his retirement, he was unemployed \nfor one month. From November 2006 to July 2007, he worked first as an electrical \nmechanic and then as a test engineer for two private companies. He was hired by his \ncurrent employer, a large defense contractor, in July 2007. \n \nHe has been married four times and divorced three times. He married his first \nwife in 1989, and they were divorced in March 1991. He married his second wife in \nNovember 1994, and they were divorced in October 1998.

He is currently \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  AE 20 was submitted post-hearing. I left the record open to allow Applicant additional time to \nsubmit matters on his behalf. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmarried to his fourth wife. However, it is not clear from the record when he married his \ncurrent wife. \n \nIn his January 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he had a \nforeclosed property and other financial problems. His background investigation \naddressed his financial problems, and included the review of January and October 2008 \ncredit bureau reports (CBRs), Applicant\u2019s answers to September 2008 DOHA \ninterrogatory, and Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DONCAF) \ncorrespondence concerning a conditional grant of security clearance due to financial \nconsiderations concerns.  \n \nIn 1998, a security clearance background investigation disclosed Applicant had \nfinancial problems which were later attributed to his ex-wife\u2019s failure to pay their \ncreditors while Applicant was deployed. Applicant demonstrated he had initiated good-\nfaith efforts to resolve his delinquencies prior to the start of the security clearance \ninvestigation. DONCAF considered his financial problems under control and he was \ngranted a conditional security clearance. In March 2000, the conditions were vacated \nwith a warning that future derogatory information would cause reconsideration of his \nsecurity clearance.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$48,000. Applicant admitted responsibility for the alleged debts and promised to pay, \nsettle, or resolve all his debts. He explained his financial problems were the result of a \nnumber of circumstances: he made the bad decision of buying a mobile home at his ex-\nwife\u2019s insistence; the expenses associated from his marital separation, maintaining two \nhouseholds, and his 2004 divorce; his retirement from the Navy; and being \nunderemployed from November 2006 to July 2007.  \n \nOn or about 2002, Applicant owned a home in State A and rented it while he was \nstationed and rented a house in State B. His third wife had an older son from a prior \nrelationship who suffered from recurrent medical problems. He was receiving medical \ntreatment in State C. His wife traveled frequently from State B to State C with \nApplicant\u2019s son to visit and stay with her older son. At his wife\u2019s insistence, Applicant \nbought a mobile home for his wife and son to live while she was visiting her older son. \nApplicant could not afford the expenses associated with maintaining the two households \n(paying two mortgages, utilities, and day-to-day living expenses). His problems were \nfurther complicated when his tenants gave him a bad check that caused his bank \naccounts to be frozen. His tenants later abandoned the property. Additionally, his wife \nfiled for a divorce. During the separation pending the divorce, the court required \nApplicant to provide alimony and child support. As a result, his mobile home was \nrepossessed and most of his debts became delinquent.  \n \nAfter his retirement, Applicant had no place to live. His home in State A was \nrented and the mobile home had been repossessed. He purchased a travel trailer from \na friend with the promise to pay it off when he sold his State A home. Because of the \nloss of income and underemployment, he was forced to use his credit cards to pay for \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nhis day-to-day living expenses. He attempted to consolidate his debts but was not able \nto do so because of the consolidation company\u2019s lack of performance and his lack of \nincome. In January 2008, Applicant sold his State A home and used his profit to pay off \nhis travel trailer and his ex-wife\u2019s car note (Tr. 45). \n \nCurrently, Applicant is remarried and has a stable home and lifestyle. Since 2007 \nhe has had stable employment and established a combined household budget (AE 16). \nHe sought credit counseling and entered into a debt management agreement to pay for \nhis largest delinquent debts first (SOR \u00b6 1.f, $20,580) (AE 17). He intends to pay his \nlargest debt first and continue addressing the remainder of the larger debts one by one \nunder the debt management agreement. At the same time, he intends to settle and pay \nhis smaller delinquent debts which are not part of the debt management agreement. \nNow that he is living with his forth wife, he also plans to sell his travel trailer and use the \nprofit to pay some of his delinquent debts. \n \nApplicant owes the following delinquent debts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.i - \n1.l, and 1.m.  \n \nApplicant settled and paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g in January 2008 (AE 20). (I find \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e alleged the same debt.) In February 2009, Applicant established a \ndebt management agreement to pay for pay for SOR \u00b6 1.f ($20,580). It will take him \napproximately four years to pay this debt. He plans to accelerate the process by \napplying additional money to the debt as he satisfies other smaller financial obligations \n(AE 20).4 He satisfied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h in March 2008. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is approximately $5,600 (GE 5). His new \nwife contributes to the household finances and pays some of the family\u2019s financial \nexpenses with financial support she received from her children\u2019s father. Applicant\u2019s \nfourth wife has delinquent accounts she is also trying to resolve. Applicant has acquired \nonly one large debt since 2006. He purchased a 2006 truck ($29,000) in June/July \n2008, because his old truck was not working and he needed a truck to pull his travel \ntrailer and commute to work. \n \nApplicant expressed sincere remorse for his past financial problems. He was \ncandid and forthcoming explaining the circumstances surrounding his financial \nproblems. I believe he has learned his lesson. He is now well aware of what is required \nof him to show that he is reliable, trustworthy, and financially responsible. He is very \nconcerned about the adverse impact losing his security clearance will have on his family \nand his career.  \n \nHe noted his selfless service to his country while in the Navy and that he has \nperformed well for his current employer. Applicant\u2019s direct and technical supervisors \n \n4  I note that Applicant attempted to start his debt management payment plan in August 2008 (GE \n5). At the time, he was under the mistaken belief he had to include all of his delinquent debts in the debt \nmanagement plan. He could not afford the then proposed debt management plan.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nduring the last two years consider him to be a highly responsible, dependable, and \nreliable employee. He is regarded as an employee with good work ethic and excellent \nperformance. Applicant has handled classified information in his current job as well as \nwhen he was in the Navy. According to his references, during the last two years he has \nestablished an excellent reputation for following the rules and procedures required to \nsafeguard classified information. He has not had any problems or violations handling \nclassified information. There is no evidence that during his 20 years of Naval service \nApplicant ever compromised or cause others to compromise classified information. \n \nApplicant believes he and his wife are personally and financially stable. They \nhave been investing time and effort to become more financially responsible. He believes \nthat given the opportunity he will be able to resolve his current financial problems as he \npreviously revolved his financial problems while he was in the Navy. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nOf the 13 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant still has eight \ndelinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $25,401 which have been \noutstanding for many years. He placed the largest debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f, $20,580) in a debt \nmanagement program and has been consistently making payments since February \n2009. He paid SOR \u00b6 1.h in March 2008, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g in January 2009. \nApplicant did not have the financial means to pay his legal obligations, delinquent debts, \n \n6  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand his day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies, but only in part because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nongoing. However, the evidence shows his financial problems occurred under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that established circumstances beyond his control \ncontributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his retirement from the service reduced \nhis monthly income in half; he was unemployed for one month after he retired and \nunderemployed for approximately one year; he purchased a mobile home because his \nthen stepson needed special medical treatment; and he had financial expenses related \nto his separation and divorce from his third wife. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but only partially, \nand does not fully mitigate the financial concerns.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to show he acted financially responsibly in light of his income, \nfinancial stability, and overall financial practices. He presented some evidence of efforts \nto contact creditors or to resolve his debts by entering into settlement agreements and \npayment plans, but mostly during 2008 and 2009.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. Applicant is resolving his financial problems, but \nhis financial problems are not yet under control. His inability to pay his small debts (less \nthan $100) shows he was financially overextended. Considering the record as a whole, \nApplicant should have been more diligent resolving his financial problems. He did show, \nhowever, that he made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. He also presented \nevidence that he is receiving financial counseling, and that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved. The remaining mitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the \nfacts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well trained \nman, and a good father and husband. He served honorably for 20 years in the Navy and \nhas been successful working for a defense contractor since 2007. He has held access \nto classified information most of his professional life. There is no evidence he has ever \ncompromised classified information or committed any security violations. He has \nestablished a reputation as a valuable, dedicated and reliable employee. Moreover, his \npast behavior shows that when he had financial difficulties he acted responsibly and \nresolved those financial problems. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his financial \nmistakes and seems resolute in fixing his current financial problems. These factors \nshow responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant acted somewhat irresponsibly when he purchased \na mobile home outside of his financial means, causing him to become financially \noverextended. He also could have been more diligent in his efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent obligations. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from his financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s naval service, his \nperformance for a government contractor, and his resolution of past financial problems \nshow reliability, judgment, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations and that \nhe can resolve his current financial problems. He is now in a stable relationship and has \na stable job. Overall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.

Applicant has\n1\nnot made any other payments, nor has he made any other effort to resolve these delinquent debts . . . He believes he is\nnot responsible for all the debt he incurred . . . Applicant\u2019s attitude towards following rules, acting responsibly, and\nexercising good judgment is troubling and a serious security concern.\u201d  Decision at 11.    \n2\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 7, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were based upon substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The Board also construes Applicant\u2019s brief as\nchallenging the Judge\u2019s impartiality.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 59 years old and an\nemployee of a federal contractor.  The information technology (IT) industry in which Applicant\nworked experienced a severe downturn in the early 2000s, and Applicant subsequently endured\nperiods of unemployment.  When he did work Applicant earned less than he had when the industry\nwas at its peak.  When not working, Applicant would pay his living expenses with credit cards.\nApplicant had credit cards with four creditors, each listed in an allegation in the SOR.  His credit\ncard debts have become delinquent, the total amount of the delinquency being $109,000.  \nAdditionally, Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007.  In the\nAnalysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that the crash in the IT industry was a circumstance\nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control which affected his financial condition.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b).\nHowever, she went on to state that Applicant had provided no evidence (1) that he had sought\nfinancial counseling; (2) that he had initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts; or (3) that his\ncreditors considered the debts resolved.   \n1\nApplicant makes numerous assertions, based on what he contends are legal principles\napplicable to his case, in support of the proposition that he does not owe various debts.  Applicant\nhas failed to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding his debts are erroneous.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  For example, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings that his current salary is\n$138,000 a year and that he failed to file income tax returns.  He also claims that his credit reports\ncontain errors.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are sustainable.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome\nof the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased.  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not\nsufficient to rebut that heavy presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).\n\n3\nFurthermore, the Board concludes that the Judge has  articulated a satisfactory explanation\nfor the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 4, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

The hearing took place as scheduled on \nApril 22, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant did not \nobject and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A and B. \nDepartment Counsel did not object and they were admitted. The record was held open \nuntil April 30, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. A document was \nreceived and marked as AE C.

You failed to file your 2006 and 2007 federal income taxes. \n \nI offered Applicant an opportunity to request a continuance to the hearing so he \nwould have notice of the allegation and time to prepare. I also offered to keep the record \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant waived his right to \ncontinue the hearing and asked that the record remain open, which was granted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He is a college graduate, single and has no \ndependents. He began working for a federal contractor in March 2008, worked for five \nmonths and was furloughed for a period of time. He has since resumed work.2  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he received credit cards or a line of credit from the four \ncreditors listed in the SOR. Applicant worked in the information technology (IT) industry \nfor many years. He stated that in 2001 to 2002, there was a severe depression in the \nindustry and it went from a situation where jobs were plentiful and abundant to a severe \nshortage of jobs. Applicant was affected by this economic downturn. He stated salaries \nand contracts fell by 40%. His salary prior to the \u201ccrash\u201d was in the middle $90,000 \nrange. He had been working overseas from 1983 to 1999 when he returned to the U.S. \nHe admitted he saved his money and from February 1999 to October 2001 he did not \nwork by choice and used money he had saved to live on. He also used credit cards, but \nwas confident that when he chose to go back to work he would be able to get a job and \npay his bills. According to Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) in \n \n1 HE I. \n \n2 Tr. 27-30, 89-90, 129-130. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \napproximately October 2001 until February 2005 he had a series of jobs in the IT \nindustry. In February 2005 he was unemployed for a short period of time. He was next \nunemployed from November 2006 to December 2006. During his periods of \nemployment Applicant was earning less than he had previously earned when the \nindustry was at its peak. During this time he primarily did contract work. When he was \nnot working he would use his credit cards to help pay his expenses. He had difficulty \nfinding work and was intermittently employed in contract work. The work would continue \nuntil the contract ran out.3 \n \n \nApplicant was paying at least the minimum payments on his credit cards during \nthis time and was never late. He stated that the credit card companies began looking at \nall his accounts and his debt to income ratio and increased the interest payments. He \ndecided to stop making any payments to any of his credit cards in November 2003 \nbecause it would take him too many years to repay the debts if he continued to make \nminimum payments. He admitted that with his current salary he could afford to make \nmore than the minimum payment.4  \n \n \nApplicant does not accept the validity of any of the collection companies that \nhave assumed his delinquent debts. He has made demands on them to provide proof of \ntheir legitimacy.5  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($20,000) is a credit card debt. Applicant has not paid \nanything on this debt since November 2003. He stated he has not been sued. He \nbelieved the actual amount of debt he incurred was $20,000. Applicant was asked if he \nmade an attempt with this creditor to begin a repayment plan. He stated: \u201cI neither \noriginated communication to them on that, nor did they originate communication to \nme.\u201d6 He believed because his credit report shows the balance to the original creditor \nas zero he does not owe anything to the collection company who holds the account \nbecause they have failed to provide him proof of ownership. Applicant disputed how the \ncollection company calculated the amount owed. He advised the collection company \nthat if they did not provide substantiated proof of their claim within 30 days it would be \nviewed as evidence of their waiver of all collection claims. He has not contacted the \ncreditor to legitimately and fairly resolve the debt.7  \n \nRegarding the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant admitted he incurred this credit \ncard debt ($24,000). He believed the amount of items actually purchased if he had paid \ncash was about $15,000. He never contacted this creditor to set up a repayment plan \n \n3 Tr. 36-45, 99-103, 130-133. \n \n4 Tr. 46-49, 73-77; AE A. \n \n5 AE A. \n \n6 Tr. 105. \n \n7 Tr. 37-48, 58, 105; AE A. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nafter he stopped making payments in November 2003. He sent a novation8 letter on \nFebruary 4, 2005, and a $100 check dated February 10, 2005, advising the company \nthat this was a settlement offer and if they cashed the check it would constitute \nacceptance and unequivocal assent to the novation/offer without recourse. He dictated \nthat the creditor was to notify him within 30 days if they did not agree. He admitted he \nreceived a letter and bill from a collection company for this debt in October 2008. \nApplicant indicated the creditor cashed the check. Applicant has not made any other \npayments to resolve this debt. Applicant admitted he never received any documentation \nfrom the creditor that they considered the matter closed.9 \n \nApplicant provided identical novation letters and $100 checks to the creditors \nlisted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($16,000, actual amount incurred approximately $10,000) and 1.d \n($49,000, actual amount owed with interest $45,000). He stated the creditors cashed \nthe checks. Applicant stated at one time he received an offer to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d from the creditor for $12,000. He did not accept it because he could not afford it. \nApplicant also provided documentation that he believes the statute of limitations is \napplicable to these debts. He stated he believed the debts were satisfied and no one \never sued him. Applicant has not made any other payments to legitimately and fairly \nresolve these debts. Applicant never received documentation from the creditor that they \nconsidered the matter closed.10  \n \nApplicant has paid a total of $300 since November 2003 on the four debts listed \nin the SOR totaling over $109,000.  \n \nApplicant stopped paying his credit card debts in November 2003. He stated:  \n \nThe important thing to understand is that the rules of the game changed. \nIn other words, yea, I decided to get into the IT profession. That\u2019s what \nI\u2019ve been doing for a very long time, and I got these credit cards and I \nmade charges on them that I was fully able to cover the payments and \nfully able to pay them off much earlier on when I made the charges. But \nthen the rules of the game changed.11  \n \n \n \n \n \n8 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines novation as follows: Substitution of new contract between same \nor different parties. The substitution of a new debt or obligation for an existing one. The substitution by \nmutual agreement of one debtor for another or of one creditor for another whereby the old debt is \nextinguished.

He stated he went on the internet and did legal research. He \ncontacted a company that specialized in handling credit card debt and he followed legal \nadvice of an attorney that was associated with the company. He then used novation \nletters to reduce his credit card debts.13  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current income is $138,000. His income last year was approximately \n$125,000. He stated he has no financial problems except his debts from six years ago. \nHe has never had financial counseling and has not filed for bankruptcy. He has one \ncredit card and maintains a balance owed of approximately $2,000 each month.14 \n \nOn his security clearance application (SCA) submitted on April 14, 2008, which \nasked if in the last 7 years, he was over 180 days delinquent on any debts, Applicant \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d He also answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if he was \u201ccurrently over 90 days \ndelinquent on any debt.\u201d15 He stated the following: \n \nBecause when I answered those questions, you know, I answered the \nquestion asked. In other words, debt refers to something financial. When \nyou\u2019re operating in the financial world, if someone says you owed me \nmoney, there must be a contract there, a valid contract. There was no \nvalid contract and I did not owe any debt, and that\u2019s why I answered no.16 \n \nHe went on to explain the following: \n \nWhen I hired on this firm to handle my credit card debts, they took the \nlegal position that there was no valid, legal debt there and they offered up, \nyou know, a legal argument for it. So in filling out that form, I took the \nsame perspective, that there was no legal debt there, and that was why I \nanswered those questions the way I did. In terms of what has actually \n \n12 Tr. 79. \n \n13 Tr. 73, 82-83. \n \n14 Tr. 76-77, 87-88, 93-94, 109. \n \n15 I have not considered Applicant\u2019s answers on his SCA for disqualifying purposes, but have \nconsidered them when analyzing the whole person and for purposes of determining credibility. \n \n16 Tr. 111-112. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \noccurred in life, the fact that none of these companies ever sued or even \nthreatened to sue, demonstrated their timidity in asserting.17 \n \nThere is no indication from a review of Applicant\u2019s documents that a law firm prepared \nthe document on his behalf or represented him. Applicant\u2019s stated that through his legal \nresearch on the internet and his association with \u201cthis company\u201d the credit card debts \nwere not legal debts. Applicant\u2019s position regarding divulging his past delinquent debts \nis as follows:   \n \nWhen I filled the form out, I had full obligation to convey past debts. But \nmy perspective was that if these were not debts of legal validity, legal \nenforceability, then they were not debts under the law.18  \n \nApplicant was asked if he had filed all of his tax returns on time. He admitted he \nhad not yet filed his 2006 and 2007 tax returns. He stated he has been \u201cwell beyond \nbusy.\u201d19 When it was brought to his attention that he had stated he was unemployed \nduring some of this time, he stated:  \n \nWell, I didn\u2019t feel a compelling necessity. I mean I\u2019m tardy on those two \nbecause I didn\u2019t feel the compelling necessity to get them done, because I \ndon\u2019t owe any money. I\u2019m due refunds.20  \n \nHe further stated:  \n \nBecause I\u2019m due a refund, and I figured and this is actually correct. If you don\u2019t \nowe the federal government money and you\u2019re tardy on the filing, they don\u2019t like it, but it \nreally doesn\u2019t add up to much. They may or may not assess a penalty for late filing.21 \n \nApplicant stated he had not yet filed his 2008 taxes, but filed for an extension. \nWhen asked by his attorney about his intentions regarding his delinquent tax filings he \nexplained he intended to file them very soon. He admitted he had not yet completed the \npaper work on these taxes. He stated he has an accountant that handles his taxes. \nWhen asked why the accountant did not file them he explained he did not provide the \naccountant the information required to file them. On April 30, 2009, Applicant\u2019s attorney \nprovided a letter that stated Applicant\u2019s 2006 and 2007 tax information were in the \nhands of his accountant. His attorney further stated \u201cThe returns are in the process of \n \n17 Tr. 113. \n \n18 Tr. 114-117. \n \n19 Tr. 121. \n \n20 Tr. 122. \n \n21 Tr. 123. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nbeing completed, and we anticipate them being finished within one week. At that time \nthey will be promptly sent to the IRS.\u201d22 \n \nApplicant does not believe he has a financial obligation to any of the creditors \nlisted in the SOR. I have considered all of the documents Applicant provided. I \nconsidered his interpretation of the rules and law. I have considered his entire testimony \nand arguments regarding the legitimacy of his claims.23  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n22 Tr. 123-124; 134-136; AE C. \n \n23 Tr. 125-127. \n\n \n8 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \nApplicant failed to responsibly satisfy his delinquent debts. The debts are more \nthan six years old and total approximately $109,000. Applicant failed to file his federal \nincome tax returns for 2006 and 2007. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control,  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he incurred the debts listed in the SOR. He admitted he \nreceived merchandise for his expenditures. He stopped paying these debts in \nNovember 2003 because he was dissatisfied with how the creditors calculated interest. \nHe has made $100 payments to three of the creditors and declared it as his settlement \noffer and if they cashed the check it would constitute their acceptance to settle the debt \nin full. I find his actions were not good faith offers to pay his just debts, but rather were a \ntool for him to renege on his responsibility to pay his exorbitant delinquent debts. He \nhas not set up payment plans to resolve the debts and his actions cast serious doubts \nabout his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. I find mitigating condition (a) does \nnot apply. \n \n \nApplicant was in an industry that went from high paying salaries to a bust in the \nindustry. The crash in the industry was a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, \nApplicant chose not to work for two years, spent his savings and used credit cards \nbecause he thought he would be able to resume a good paying job. I do not find he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. He accumulated $109,000 in credit card \ndebt. He does not own a house, he has no dependents to support and although the job \nmarket did not offer the same type of wages he had been accustomed to, he is also \npartially responsible for his plight. Instead of conserving and saving, he made a choice \nto not work. He then experienced periods of unemployment. This is not a case where \nApplicant has done the best he can to repay the debts. To the contrary his attitude has \nbeen one of hostility towards his creditors. I find (b) only partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has received financial counseling. He \ndid not provide evidence that the problem is being resolved. He did not provide any \nproof that his creditors considered the debts resolved. Applicant contends the statute of \n\n \n10 \n \n \nlimitations applies to his debts. In security clearance cases, the statute of limitations is \nnot a shield from acting responsibly. I find Applicant did not initiate a good faith effort to \npay his creditors or resolve his debts. Instead he looked for a way to renege on them. \nApplicant admitted he made purchases with his credit cards and then failed to pay them. \nI find mitigating conditions (c), (d) and (e) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his 2006 and 2007 income tax returns. His cavalier attitude \nabout his responsibilities reflects a pattern of questionable judgment. After his hearing \nhis attorney provided a letter stating he was in the process of filing his delinquent tax \nreturns. His post-hearing submission is not a substitute for his failure to abide by the \nlaw. Rather it is another instance of Applicant defying rules and applying them as he \nsees fit, a dangerous trait when dealing with national security. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person who \nworked in an industry where he earned a good salary. He chose to live off his savings \nand use his credit cards to pay his expenses for a period of 32 months. When he chose \nto return to work the market had changed and Applicant had difficulty finding a job \nsimilar to what he had before he stopped working. He did contractual work and \nexperienced periods of unemployment. Applicant continued to make minimum \npayments on his credit cards and decided in November 2003 that he would stop paying \nthem. Two years later he sent letters to his some of his creditors with $100 payments to \ntotally resolve his debts. Applicant has not made any other payments, nor has he made \nany other effort to resolve these delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s attitude toward his \nfinancial responsibility is troubling. He believes he is not responsible for all the debt he \nincurred. He does not accept the collection companies\u2019 claims. Applicant also failed to \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfile his 2006 and 2007 tax returns, believing the IRS does not care because he believes \nhe is entitled to a refund. Applicant\u2019s attitude towards following rules, acting responsibly, \nand exercising good judgment is troubling and a serious security concern. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 7, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were based upon substantial record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

The information technology (IT) industry in which Applicant\nworked experienced a severe downturn in the early 2000s, and Applicant subsequently endured\nperiods of unemployment.  When he did work Applicant earned less than he had when the industry\nwas at its peak.  When not working, Applicant would pay his living expenses with credit cards.\nApplicant had credit cards with four creditors, each listed in an allegation in the SOR.  His credit\ncard debts have become delinquent, the total amount of the delinquency being $109,000.  \nAdditionally, Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007.  In the\nAnalysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that the crash in the IT industry was a circumstance\nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control which affected his financial condition.  See Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b).\nHowever, she went on to state that Applicant had provided no evidence (1) that he had sought\nfinancial counseling; (2) that he had initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts; or (3) that his\ncreditors considered the debts resolved.   \n1\nApplicant makes numerous assertions, based on what he contends are legal principles\napplicable to his case, in support of the proposition that he does not owe various debts.  Applicant\nhas failed to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding his debts are erroneous.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  For example, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings that his current salary is\n$138,000 a year and that he failed to file income tax returns.  He also claims that his credit reports\ncontain errors.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern are sustainable.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome\nof the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased.  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not\nsufficient to rebut that heavy presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).\nFurthermore, the Board concludes that the Judge has  articulated a satisfactory explanation\nfor the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant had credit cards with four creditors, each listed in an allegation in the SOR. His credit card debts have become delinquent, the total amount of the delinquency being $109,000. Additionally, Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2007. In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted that the crash in the IT industry was a circumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control which affected his financial condition. See Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b). However, she went on to state that Applicant had provided no evidence (1) that he had sought financial counseling; (2) that he had initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts; or (3) that his creditors considered the debts resolved. 1 Applicant makes numerous assertions, based on what he contends are legal principles applicable to his case, in support of the proposition that he does not owe various debts. Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s findings and",

On September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 2, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On December 5, 2008, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me and issued a Notice of Hearing on January 7, 2009. The case was heard on \nJanuary 28, 2009, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered exhibits \n(AE) A through D into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on February 9, 2009.   \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nParagraph 1 of the SOR, and offered explanations in support of his request for eligibility \nfor a security clearance. His admissions are incorporated into the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old married man, who served in the military for more than \nthirty years. In November 1972, he enlisted in the Army\u2019s active reserve. He \nsubsequently attended Officer Candidate School (OCS) and in May 1976 he was \ncommissioned as a second lieutenant. From October 1978 to March 1987, he was in \nthe Individual Ready Reserve (IRR), where he performed minimal Active duty. In March \n1987, he went on full-time active duty as a Captain. At one point, he was deployed for \nseven months to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. \n \n  \n While in the Army, Applicant served as an operations officer, involved in various \nlong-range planning projects. He was also a combat engineer, a professor of military \nscience and manager of facilities construction. (GE 7) He received various \ncommendations and awards, such as a Legion of Merit, Korea Defense Service Medal, \nand Army Commendation medal. (Id.). While in the Army, he held a Top Secret SCI \nsecurity clearance. He earned an Associate\u2019s degree in Criminal Justice, a Bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in Communication, and a Master\u2019s in Public Administration while in the Army. In \nApril 2005, Applicant retired from the Army Reserves as a lieutenant colonel with an \nhonorable discharge \n \n \nWhile serving in the Reserves from 1972 to 1987, Applicant worked as a \npoliceman, sold insurance, was an operations manager for a corporation, and held other \npositions. Since retiring in April 2005, he has worked as a part-time consultant, \nperforming quality assurance duties, for a federal contractor that works with the Army \nCorps of Engineers. Although he previously had access to classified information while in \nthe Army, he does not generally work with it now. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1976 and currently holds a Secret security clearance. (Tr. 7; 30) \n \n \nApplicant began using marijuana recreationally in 1969 while in college and at \ntimes attempted to cultivate it.  From that time up to approximately 1987, he used it 40 \nto 50 times. (Answer; Tr. 29) In August 1983, he was arrested for possessing marijuana. \nThe charge was later dismissed. In 1988, he tested positive for marijuana, although he \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndenied consuming it. A few days later, he was again tested and the results were \nnegative. He admitted that he had been at a party where people had been smoking it. \n \n \nApplicant did not smoke marijuana from 1987 until after he retired in April 2005, \nwhen he resumed using it in May or June of 2005. Since then, he has used marijuana at \nleast ten times, including in May and July of 2008 with family and friends, despite having \nsubmitted a SF 86 in January 2008. (Tr. 30-33). When asked why he used it after \ncompleting that SF 86, he stated, \u201cWell, I guess maybe we are splitting hairs. But I am \nnot a full-time employee of a defense contractor of the U.S. Government.\u201d (Tr. 38) \n \n \n Although Applicant acknowledges that consuming marijuana is illegal, he does \nnot believe occasionally using it is a \u201cbad thing.\u201d (Answer; Tr. 31-33) He vows that he \nwould not use it while employed by the federal government, but cannot honestly state \nthat he will never use it again in the future if not employed by the government. (Tr. 38-\n39)  He was very candid and honest in describing his previous drug use and the \npossibility of use in the future. He has never received any type of treatment for \nsubstance abuse. (Tr. 39). He insisted that he never used marijuana while on Active \nduty, but admitted that he used it while holding a security clearance. (Answer) \n \n \nApplicant submitted four letters of character reference. Two Lieutenant Colonels \ncommend Applicant for his work and consider him to be very trustworthy. (AE A; B) A \nretired Sergeant Major, who has known Applicant for 20 years and served with him, has \nno questions about his loyalty to the United States. (AE C) A retired Major General \nconsiders Applicant to have an exceptional character and integrity. He has known \nApplicant for 10 years. (AE D) None of the four character witnesses indicated that they \nare aware of Applicant\u2019s past marijuana usage or potential for use in the future.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and \nhallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets forth conditions that could raise a drug involvement security \nconcern and be disqualifying. They include: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana from 1969 until 1987, and again from \nMay 2005 up to July 2008. That evidence established facts that raise significant security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c).    \n \nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto rebut or produce evidence to prove mitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides the following \nmitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n (c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAfter considering the record evidence, none of the four mitigating conditions \napplies to this case. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because Applicant used marijuana \nrecreationally for about 18 years, from 1969 to 1987, and then occasionally after May \n2005, up to July 2008, less than six months ago. Hence, his behavior is sufficiently \nrecent and frequent over the years, casting doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment.  \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (2) do not apply because Applicant continues to associate with \nfriends and family with whom he has used marijuana. Applicant\u2019s unsubstantiated \nassertion of six months of abstinence is not sufficient to trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), given his history of using marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(b)(4) is not applicable. \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 26(c) or AG \u00b6 26 \n(d). Applicant has used marijuana for recreational purposes and not as an authorized \nmedical prescription. He did not complete a prescribed drug treatment program as \ncontemplated under the guidelines. \nIn addition to the normal concerns under Guideline H, at issue here is whether \nApplicant is disqualified, as a matter of law, from security clearance eligibility due to his \nillegal drug use. The pertinent law is now 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, which provides, in relevant \npart, as follows: \u201cAfter January 1, 2008, the head of a Federal agency may not grant or \nrenew a security clearance for a covered person who is an unlawful user of a controlled \nsubstance or an addict\u201d as defined by federal law. This prohibition uses language that is \nnearly identical to the previous prohibition in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986.1  \nAs a starting point, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c applies to Applicant because he is an \nemployee of a federal contractor.2 Second, there is no evidence to prove that Applicant \nis an addict. Third, there is ample evidence to prove that Applicant was an unlawful user \nof a controlled substance, as the record evidence shows that Applicant smoked \n                                                          \n1 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) (2) (2008) (\u201cThe person is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled \nsubstance\u201d as defined by federal law.). \n2 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435(a) (2) (defining a covered person under the statute). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmarijuana on a regular basis from 1969 until 1987, and occasionally from May 2005 \nuntil July 2008. But, there is insufficient evidence to prove that Applicant is currently an \nunlawful user. (Emphasis added). \nThe statutory prohibition in 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b), like its predecessor in 10 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 986(c)(2), uses the present tense, not the past tense. A plain-meaning reading of the \nstatute cannot be stretched to apply Applicant\u2019s marijuana use that took place six \nmonths ago in July 2008. To read it otherwise would result in a mandatory \ndisqualification of a person who engaged in drug abuse three years ago or perhaps at \nany time in the past, a result inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. This \ninterpretation of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c(b) is consistent with Appeal Board case law from \n2003 and 2005 when it interpreted 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c) (2) in the same way.3  Hence, the \ncurrent federal statute pertaining to substance abuse does not apply to this case. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nfollowing nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s forthright \ntestimony. Applicant is an intelligent and successful 57-year old man, who has a military \nhistory \nof \nimpressive \naccomplishments, \na \npatriotic \ndisposition, \nand \nsolid \n                                                          \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 03-25009 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005) (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) uses the present \ntense, not the past tense, when referring to unlawful use of, or addiction to, controlled substances, \nconsequently, the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Congress intended that persons who \nhad been addicted to, or dependent on, controlled substances in the past to be forever barred from being \ngranted a clearance); ISCR Case No. 01-20314 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 2003) (Administrative Judge erred by \napplying  10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(2) to an applicant who last used marijuana about two years before the \nhearing). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nrecommendations from his colleagues. However, that history is overshadowed by his \nhistory of marijuana use and a strong possibility that he may use it in the future.     \n \nApplicant began purchasing and using marijuana while in college in 1969. He \nused it until 1987, during which time he held a security clearance. He resumed using it \nafter retiring from the Army in April 2005, and continued to periodically use it until July \n2008, despite completing an SF 86 in January 2008. He knows marijuana is illegal, and \nstrongly asserts that he will not use it again, while employed by the Government. He \noffers his past Army performance and patriotism as evidence of assurance. He claims \nthat he has not used it for six months, but did not corroborate his statement with any \ndrug screenings or a substance abuse assessment from an appropriate credentialed \nmental health professional. However, he candidly admitted that he may use it in the \nfuture, if and when he is no longer employed by the federal government.   \n \n Clearly, Applicant has a \u201cblind spot\u201d regarding his illegal drug use. While he \nappears committed to abstinence in view of his employment opportunity, he has not \nestablished a sufficient track record of rehabilitation to persuade me that he has \naddressed the underlying issues related to his marijuana use. His candid insistence on \nthe possibility of using it in the future, demonstrates not only poor judgment, but also a \nlack of respect and adherence to rules and regulations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot mitigate the security concerns arising under drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1h:     \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 2, 2008; answered it on January 2, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on January 5, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on February 17, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 3, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March \n27, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel also submitted \nHearing Exhibit (HX) I, a demonstrative exhibit summarizing the documentary evidence. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, \nwhich were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record \nopen until April 10, 2009, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 2, 2009. On April 14, 2009, I extended the \ndeadline for submission of additional evidence until April 20, 2009. Applicant timely \nsubmitted AX C through J, which were admitted without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s comments regarding AX C through J are attached to the record as HX II. The \nrecord closed on April 20, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but he \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old radar applications engineer employed by a federal \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He has worked \nfor several federal contractors since August 2001, except for a three-month period of \nunemployment in 2004. He was granted a clearance in July 2002, but it was \nadministratively terminated when he changed jobs. \n \n \nApplicant was married in April 1996. They have no children from their marriage, \nbut his wife has two children from a previous relationship, for whom she voluntarily pays \nchild support of $200 per month (Tr. 58).  \n \nApplicant attended college from September 1989 to May 1992. He worked in \nprivate industry from June 1993 to April 2001, was laid off for three or four months, and \nthen worked for a federal contractor from August 2001 to February 2004, when he was \nlaid off again. He was unemployed from February to May 2004, and then worked for \nanother federal contractor until March 2008, when he began working for his current \nemployer. He resumed college classes in May 2005, and he completed his college \ndegree requirements in September 2006.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife became ill in 2003. She required extensive surgery, was \nhospitalized for about six months, and unable to work for about nine months, reducing \nthe monthly family income by about $1,000 (Tr. 43-45). \n \n \nThe first debt alleged in the SOR is a past due utility bill for $128. The bill \nbecame due while Applicant was traveling for his employer, and he forgot to pay it. He \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntestified the account is now current (Tr. 21). His testimony was corroborated by his bank \nstatement showing recent payments (AX D at 1).  \n \n \nThe second debt alleged in the SOR is a home mortgage that became delinquent \naround August 2007. Applicant was unable to keep his payments current because his \nfather passed away in July 2007 and his brother passed away a month later, causing \nApplicant to spend about $20,000 for overseas travel and funeral expenses (Tr. 32-34). \nHe testified the deaths of his father and his brother \u201ctook its toll\u201d on him financially and \nemotionally (Tr. 26). He failed to make his monthly mortgage payments of $1,000.32 for \nabout five months (Tr. 39). In May 2008, he started making payments of $1,500 to make \nup for the delinquent payments (Tr. 35-37; GX 3 at 4). He stopped making payments \nafter September 2008, because the lender initiated foreclosure proceedings and refused \nto accept his payments (Tr. 37). He then negotiated a loan modification agreement \nproviding for monthly payments of $692.63, starting on April 1, 2009 (Tr. 34; AX B). \nAlthough the copy of the loan modification agreement submitted by Applicant was \nunsigned, he produced documentary evidence that he had made one payment in \naccordance with the agreement and the payment check had been cashed by the lender \n(AX J).  \n \n \nThe third debt alleged in the SOR is a student loan with a balance of about \n$36,000 that became delinquent around August 2006. Applicant admitted his payments \non this loan were \u201con and off,\u201d but he testified he could not recall why he fell behind on \nhis payments on this loan (Tr. 42). He stopped making payments when collection \nagencies started demanding $800 or $900 a month instead of the payments of about \n$300 he had been sending to the original creditor (Tr. 41). \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant entered a loan rehabilitation program for his \nstudent loan, and initiated an automatic debit from his checking account of $300 per \nmonth (GX 3 at 9-11; AX D at 2). On March 27, 2009, he was notified his student loan \nhad been sold and the payment terms changed. Starting on May 16, 2009, his \npayments will be $374.67 (AX F, G, and H). \n \n \nAt the hearing, it was clear that Applicant was embarrassed by his history of \ndelinquent debts. When advised of his right to have a personal representative assist \nhim, he responded that the inquiry into his financial history was \u201ca real personal matter,\u201d \nand he did not want to involve any of his friends in it (Tr. 4). \n \n \nApplicant and his wife do not have a family budget (Tr. 50-51). He testified his \nnet family income is about $5,400 per month, with living expenses and debt payments \ntotaling about $3,000, leaving a remainder of around $2,000. He testified he has \nretirement funds of about $15,000 to $20,000, and his wife has retirement funds of \nabout $4,000 to $5,000 (Tr. 52). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges a past due utility bill (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a delinquent home mortgage \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and a delinquent student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nTwo potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 \n19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) \nis raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial history raises both of these disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to him \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. If any of \nthe three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished unless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first two prongs of AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not \nestablished because Applicant had multiple debts that were only recently resolved. The \nthird prong (\u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) applies to \nthe delinquent home mortgage, because it was triggered by the deaths of Applicant\u2019s \nfather and brother, but it does not apply to the utility bill or student loan. Applicant\u2019s \nperiods of unemployment occurred well before any of the debts alleged in the SOR \nbecame delinquent. Applicant attributed the past due utility bill to forgetfulness, and he \n\n \n6 \n \n \noffered no cogent or plausible explanation for falling behind on his student loan. \nAlthough he testified about his wife\u2019s illness and loss of income, that event preceded the \ndelinquent student loan by about three years. The final prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) is \nestablished because Applicant has taken significant steps to resolve his financial \nproblems and his financial situation is under control. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). This mitigating condition is established for the \ndelinquent mortgage but not the other two debts, for the reasons set out above in the \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 20(a). \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. \u201cAll that is \nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that [he/she] has . . . established a plan to \nresolve [his/her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). Applicant\u2019s utility account appears to \nbe current. He has renegotiated payment schedules for his home mortgage and his \nstudent loan, and he appears to be complying with the new payment schedules. I \nconclude this mitigating condition is established for all three debts. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is relatively young, well-educated, and intelligent. He may have been \nfinancially na\u00efve when he allowed the student loans to become delinquent. He was \ncandid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He and his wife are not careful financial \nplanners. Instead, they appear to have taken an ad hoc approach to their financial \nobligations. However, Applicant has found the inquiry into his financial history \nembarrassing, and he is not likely to allow it to recur. He has a steady income and is not \nfinancially overextended. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on his financial history. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On April 22, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 21, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness\ndesignation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant maintains that no evidence was presented at\nthe hearing to show that his financial situation would cause him to engage in criminal activity or\n\ncause a security breach.  Applicant also notes that he will not be able to improve his financial\nsituation if he loses his job due to denial of a trustworthiness designation.  Finding no error, we\naffirm the Judge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 30 years old and\nprovides technical support to a Defense contractor.  The SOR in Applicant\u2019s case lists seven overdue\ndebts (primarily credit card balances and a car repossession).  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant\nadmits all of the debts, but disputes the amounts owed to two of the creditors.  Applicant\u2019s credit was\ngood until he lost a job in 2003.  Applicant states that he lost that job because his employer found\nout that he was seeking another job.  Applicant was out of work for approximately a month and then\nbegan working at a job that paid about half his former salary.  After about a year, Applicant began\nworking for his current employer at approximately the salary he was earning before he lost his job\nin 2003 and now earns more that he did at the job he lost.  Applicant has made no payments on the\noverdue debts since 2003, although he had indicated that he would begin doing so in 2007.  A\nsupervisory witness from Applicant\u2019s job testified that he is a good person and a conscientious and\ndependable worker.\n    \n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).\nApplicant contends that there is no evidence that he is a security risk or would commit any\ntype of crime because of his financial situation.  Applicant admitted the alleged overdue debts listed\nin the SOR, even if he disputed some of the amounts.  The Directive presumes there is a nexus, or\nrational connection, between proven conduct under any of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness eligibility.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-07799 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2008).\nTherefore, Department Counsel is not required to present evidence that shows a direct or objective\nnexus between an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances and their trustworthiness eligibility.  The\nfederal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to properly handle\nsensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See, e.g, ADP Case\nNo. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007).  Trustworthiness determinations are not limited to\nconsideration of an applicant\u2019s job performance or conduct during duty hours, and off-duty conduct\ncan be relevant in assessing an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-\n07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007).  An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may\nengage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness implications.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293\nsupra at 2.  The Directive\u2019s Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and\ncircumstances which are of trustworthiness concern to the government.\nIn his response to the government\u2019s SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged overdue debts.  His\nadmissions established the government\u2019s prima facie case.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts he admitted.  The ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable trustworthiness determination rests with Applicant.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\n\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-13629 at 3 (App. Bd.\nSep. 4, 2007).\nApplicant testified that his financial situation was due to events beyond his control in his\nwork history and that he planned to begin paying his overdue debts soon. The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  He reasonably\nexplained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome  the\ngovernment\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the\nrecord that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under\nGuideline F is sustainable.  Thus, the Judge did not err in denying Applicant a trustworthiness\ndesignation.\nApplicant contends that an negative trustworthiness determination will cause him to lose his\njob and therefore his ability to repay his overdue debts.  The adverse effect that an unfavorable\ntrustworthiness determination might have on Applicant\u2019s employment is not a factor that can be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibiility.

    "judges_findings_of_fact": ": Applicant is 30 years old and provides technical support to a Defense contractor. The SOR in Applicant\u2019s case lists seven overdue debts (primarily credit card balances and a car repossession). In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the debts, but disputes the amounts owed to two of the creditors. Applicant\u2019s credit was good until he lost a job in 2003. Applicant states that he lost that job because his employer found out that he was seeking another job. Applicant was out of work for approximately a month and then began working at a job that paid about half his former salary. After about a year, Applicant began working for his current employer at approximately the salary he was earning before he lost his job in 2003 and now earns more that he did at the job he lost. Applicant has made no payments on the overdue debts since 2003, although he had indicated that he would begin doing so in 2007. A supervisory witness from Applicant\u2019s job testified that he is a good person and a conscientious and dependable worker. A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). Applicant contends that there is no evidence that he is a security risk or would commit any type of crime because of his financial situation. Applicant admitted the alleged overdue debts listed in the SOR, even if he disputed some of the amounts. The Directive presumes there is a nexus, or rational connection, between proven conduct under any of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-07799 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2008). Therefore, Department Counsel is not required to present evidence that shows a direct or objective nexus between an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances and their trustworthiness eligibility. The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to properly handle sensitive information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. See, e.g, ADP Case No. 06-09293 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2007). Trustworthiness determinations are not limited to consideration of an applicant\u2019s job performance or conduct during duty hours, and off-duty conduct can be relevant in assessing an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06- 07581 at 2 (App. Bd. May 17, 2007). An applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative trustworthiness implications. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 06-09293 supra at 2. The Directive\u2019s Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty conduct and circumstances which are of trustworthiness concern to the government. In his response to the government\u2019s SOR, Applicant admitted the a",

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nNovember 20, 2005. On April 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns for financial considerations under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 1, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 5, 2009. He admitted the seven \nallegations under Guideline F, but noted that he was disputing the amount owed on two \ndebts listed in the SOR. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 5, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on July 24, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 13, \n2009, for a hearing on August 31, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \n1 \n \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n2 \n \ngovernment offered five exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant submitted two exhibits, marked \nApplicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A and B, which were received without objection. Applicant \nand one witness testified on his behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on September 8, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 19, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of June 9, 2009, prior to the Notice of Hearing \nbeing mailed so notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing. However, \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 13 days prior to the hearing. If there was \nan issue on notice, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 5-6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and has worked for over five years for a defense \ncontractor providing technical support on a U.S. Army installation. He served briefly in \nthe Navy. He is now married with three children. When he started to incur delinquent \ndebt in 2004, he was a single parent with a daughter to support. He is presently taking \ncollege courses (Tr. 20); Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated \nNovember 20, 2005; App. Ex. B, Enrollment and Grades, dated June 23, 2009). While \nApplicant and his wife have a combined salary of about $6,200 monthly, they manage \ntheir finances separately because of his credit issues.  His personal net monthly salary \nis approximately $2,400 with monthly expenses of approximately $1,800. He has $400 \nto $600 monthly in discretionary funds which he uses to pay his past due obligations \n(Tr. 33-34, 42-44). \n \n \nCredit reports listed the following delinquent debts for Applicant: a credit card \ndebt in collection for $27,316 (SOR 1.a); a delinquent credit card debt for $6,842 (SOR \n1.b); another credit card debt in collection for $18,330 (SOR 1.c); a car repossession \ndebt in collection for $12,706 (SOR 1.d); a credit card debt in collection for $6,941 (SOR \n1.e); a medical debt for $343 (SOR 1.f); and a credit card debt in collection for $328 \n(SOR 1.g; Gov. Ex. 3, Credit report, dated February 20, 2009; Gov. Ex. R, Credit report, \ndated August 7, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated December 14, 2005). Applicant \ndoes not dispute the debts at SOR 1.f and 1.g. He does dispute the amount of each of \nthese debts. \n \n \nApplicant's credit was good until he was terminated by a former employer in late \n2003. The employer noted that he was terminated because of his attitude towards \nmanagement and the company. Just prior to his termination, he received an award as \nService Representative of the Year for 2002 (App. Ex. A, Award Plague). Applicant \nstated he was terminated because he applied for another job and the prospective \nemployer called his current employer for a reference. Since he was terminated and out \nof work, he accepted a position with another company about a month later that paid \n\n3 \n \napproximately half of his former salary. He worked at this company for about a year until \nmid 2004 when he accepted a position with his current employer at a salary rate similar \nto what he made with his first employer. He has been with this employer for over five \nyears, and has received salary increases so that he now makes more than he made \nwith his first employer (Tr. 20-23).   \n \n \nWhen he was with his first employer, he had a number of personal credit card \naccounts. He used the bank credit card listed at SOR 1.a for household items and \ngroceries. The initial credit limit on the card was $12,000, and he had a balance of over \n$11,000 in 2003 when he lost his job and stopped making payments. The bank and the \ncollection agency have added fees to this account so the debt is listed at $27,000. He \nhas not been able to make any payments to the bank or the collection agency (Tr. 24-\n25).  \n \n \nApplicant also used the credit card at SOR 1. b for household items. He has not \nmade any payments on this debt. The delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.c is a revolving \ncredit account. Applicant first used the card to purchase electronics. He has made no \npayments since 2003 to the creditor or the collection agency (Tr. 25-26). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt listed at SOR 1.d is for an automobile repossession. He \nreturned the car to the dealer in 2003 when he lost his job. After the sale of the car at \nauction, he stilled owed the creditor more than $6,000. He has not made any payment \non this debt since 2003 because he does not have the ability to pay it. Applicant \nbelieves the debt at SOR 1.e is a duplicate of the debt either at SOR 1.c or SOR 1.d. He \ndid not present any information to support his conclusion that the debts were duplicates \n(Tr. 26-27). \n \n \nApplicant is disputing the amount of $343 listed for the medical debt at SOR 1.f. \nApplicant sought medical treatment for a chest injury. He was unhappy with the totality \nof the care he received. Some of the care was fine, but he did not believe the hospital or \nmedical personnel did a good job. He never questioned or challenged the medical \nprovider or the collection agency about his opinion of the care, or disputed the charges \nwith them (Tr. 27-29). \n \n \nApplicant also disputed the amount of the debt listed at SOR 1.g. Applicant was \nenrolled in a correspondence course. He received the course material and requested an \nexam to complete and receive credit for the course. The school never sent him the final \nexamination, so he refuses to pay for the course (Tr. 29-31). His requests and dealings \nwere with the school. He provided no documentation of his dispute. He never disputed \nthe account with the credit reporting agency. \n \n \nApplicant stopped making payments on his debts in mid 2003. As he changed \nemployers and received more salary, he did not pay the delinquent debts because he \nhad current debts to pay. He received settlement offers from some of the companies, \nbut he did not accept them because he was unable to pay the settlement amount (Tr. \n29-31). He never sought financial counseling as he tried to repay these debts. He \n\n4 \n \nindicated he would start making payments on these debts in 2007 but has not made any \npayments on the accounts (Tr. 31-32). \n \n \nApplicant's government employee supervisor testified she has known and \nsupervised Applicant for over five years. He is honest and reliable. He is a good person \nto work with and he can be counted on to support the mission. He has assisted the \norganization whenever he was called, on days off or on vacation. She has never known \nhim to do anything to jeopardize sensitive information (Tr. 44-48). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \n\n5 \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThere is a public trust concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from a car repossession, credit cards, and \nbank revolving accounts as established by credit reports and Applicant\u2019s statements \nand testimony, are a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying \nConditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 \n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant has delinquent debts \ndating to 2003 which he has not resolved and indicates a history of not meeting financial \nobligations as well as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy his debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). While the debts were incurred some time ago, they are still \nunpaid and thus considered current. Applicant lost employment when terminated by his \ncompany. He has not made payments on the debt even though he had been employed \n\n6 \n \nsince he was terminated. Even though there is a disagreement on the reason for \ntermination, Applicant played a sufficient role in the termination so that the \ncircumstances were not beyond his control. He either indicated to his employer his \ndissatisfaction with company management or he sought different employment without \nfirst notifying his current employer of his intentions and actions. He has not acted \nresponsibly towards his debts. His inaction to pay his delinquent debts casts doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI have not considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). Applicant presented no information on financial counseling \nand his finances are not under control or being resolved.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue) and it does not apply. Applicant does not dispute a debt for \nmedical care and another for school course work. He does dispute the amount owed on \neach of the debts. However, he made no payment on either debt and provided no \ninformation concerning his dispute or attempts to resolve them. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\". For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Most of the debts arose in the 2006 and 2007 time \nframe. He has been gainfully employed since 2004 and has a good income. Applicant \npresented no information to show he is paying his delinquent debts. He may have \nresolved two debts, but he has numerous debts for which he admits he has not \ncontacted the creditors or made any attempt to pay. He has not established a \nmeaningful, reasonable, honest, or prudent plan to pay his debts. Applicant has not \npresented sufficient information to establish a good-faith effort to pay creditors or \nresolve debts. His finances are not under control and he has not acted responsibly. He \ndid not mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n7 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant was a \nsingle parent raising a child when he encountered delinquent debt. He has a good \nreputation for honesty and reliability in the workplace.   \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that \nis required is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of debt payment \nbecause he has not paid most of his debts. He has had sufficient monthly income from \nat least 2004 to address some of his financial obligations. However, he has not paid any \nof these debts and has not presented a credible and realistic plan to pay his delinquent \ndebts. He has not demonstrated that he is managing his finances responsibly under the \ncircumstances. The lack of responsible action to manage past obligations indicates \nApplicant will not be concerned and responsible, but careless in regard to sensitive \ninformation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. I conclude Appellant has not \nmitigated the public trust concerns arising from his financial situation, and I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial \nsituation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n8 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns raised under\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. Clearance is denied.\nOn February 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn March 19, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the allegations\nand requesting an administrative determination. On April 15, 2009, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), and DOHA mailed it to Applicant. He\nreceived it on February 30, 2009, along with instructions to file any objections or\nJuly 24, 2009\n\n2\nsupplementary information within 30 days. Applicant did not respond, and the case was\nassigned to me on June 11, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old single man with two adult children. Three previous\nmarriages ended in divorce. The last divorce occurred in 1990. Applicant is a veteran of\nthe U.S. Marine Corps, serving from 1974 through 1986. He was honorably discharged.\nWhile in the Marines, Applicant attended college, earning a Bachelor of Science in\nAviation Management in 1986 (Item 4 at 2). Since 2006, he has worked for a defense\ncontractor as a logistician. \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totalling approximately $33,800. SOR\nsubparagraph 1.a alleges a delinquent account for $18,859. The government\u2019s\nsupporting evidence is contradictory. The creditor is listed twice on a credit report (See\nItem 5 at 33). The first listing indicates the debt is $8,859, and that Applicant is paying it,\n\u201cas agreed\u201d (Id.). The second listing indicates it is a charged off debt in the amount\nalleged in the SOR. In his Answer, Applicant contends the creditor financed a car that\nhe purchased, then repossessed it when it became delinquent. The creditor resold the\ncar, and has been billing him for a deficiency of approximately $9,000, which he has\nbeen paying in $323 monthly increments (Item 1 at 1). I find that SOR subparagraph 1.a\nis not delinquent.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d are state income tax liens for delinquent\nincome taxes stemming from 1995 and 1996. They collectively total approximately\n$1,200. Applicant contends he made arrangements to pay these delinquencies through\nhis 2000 tax return. His 2000 state income tax return, which he provided, does not\nsupport this contention.\nSOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g through 1.h are miscellaneous bills totaling\napproximately $800. Applicant provided insufficient evidence to support his contention\nthat he has contacted the respective creditors to either satisfy the debts or arrange\npayment plans.\nSOR subparagraph 1.f is a $12,589 delinquent debt owed to the U.S. Internal\nRevenue Service (IRS). The IRS filed a lien against Applicant\u2019s property in this amount\nin June 2002 (Item 5 at 6). The lien was released in November 2008. It is unclear from\nthe record why the lien was released.\nOn December 5, 2008, Applicant retained a company that handles tax\ncontroversies to assist him in resolving this matter (Item 3 at pp. 3-13). Under their\nagreement, the company will file tax returns for tax years 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2008,\nand file amended returns for 2005 through 2007 (Item 3 at 9). Then, it will perform an\nincome and expense analysis, and develop a settlement plan (Id.). Applicant has paid\nthe company an initial start-up fee of $3,000 (Id. at 3).\n\n3\nSOR subparagraph 1.i is a debt owed to a fitness center that Applicant joined in\nOctober 2001 (Item 5 at 8). Applicant contests this debt. He stated in his Answer that he\nis appealing it because he lost his job shortly after joining the fitness center. His security\nclearance application does not reflect any period of unemployment since joining the\nfitness center (see generally, Item 4, Section 11).\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his multiple divorces, child support\nexpenses, and \u201cvarious years with lean or less than adequate income\u201d (Item 6 at 3).\nAlso, in 2005, his mother, who was suffering from cancer, and his brother, an epileptic,\nmoved in with Applicant (Id.). Only his mother was able to assist with household\nexpenses. \nIn August 2008, Applicant organized a budget. He is paying several debts, which\nare not listed in the SOR, in a timely fashion, including a car note and a major car repair\nbill (Item 6 at 6-28).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 18). Applicant denied SOR subparagraph 1.a, and the\ngovernment\u2019s supporting evidence was contradictory. SOR subparagraph 1.a is not\ndelinquent, and does not generate a security concern. \nThe eight remaining SOR debts, totaling approximately $15,000, are delinquent.\nSix of these debts are for less than $400 each. These remaining delinquencies trigger\nthe application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were exacerbated by multiple divorces and the\nfinancial strain when two sickly relatives moved into his home in 2005. Since then, he\nhas organized a budget, arranged a payment plan for his most significant debt, (the IRS\ndelinquency), and has been paying several other unlisted debts in a timely fashion. The\nfollowing mitigating conditions apply:\nAG \u00b6 20(b) - the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nand,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) - the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant failed to present persuasive evidence supporting his contention that he\nis satisfying the state tax debts as listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.c through 1.d.\nMoreover, he provided insufficient evidence that he is working toward satisfying or\nresolving the remaining SOR debts. None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n5\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused, in part, by multiple divorces. His\nability to resolve them has been hampered by the additional strain of having to assist in\nthe support of a disabled brother. His maintenance of a budget, effort at resolving the\nIRS tax delinquency, and payment of several debts unlisted in the SOR is indicative of\nrehabilitation. \nAlthough Applicant has retained professional assistance to satisfy the IRS debt,\nand paid their initial fee, he has yet to make any payments to the IRS. His contention\nthat he was either researching or disputing the remaining debts was unsupported by\nsufficient evidence. Consequently, despite some presence of rehabilitation, it is too\nsoon to conclude Applicant\u2019s financial problems no longer pose a security risk.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b - 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He appears to have not previously held a clearance.\nHe retired from the U.S. Navy in December 2004, with a partial medical disability, after\n20 years service.\n \nThe SOR alleges and government exhibits substantiate, 43 delinquent debts\ntotaling over $57,000.

He corroborates none of his claims,\nincluding claimed regular payments on the debt at SOR 1.c. The record is devoid of\nexplanations for the debt or efforts to resolve them. His personal financial statement\n(PFS)(Item 6) shows $1,500 positive monthly cash flow.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\n\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n3\n3\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which are ongoing.  The record contains no evidence in\n3\nextenuation, mitigation, or rehabilitation. Consequently, none of the mitigating factors for\nfinancial considerations apply. The record lacks any information upon which to base a\n\u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes delinquent debt totaling $72,027 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). Applicant admitted the debt, although she averred she had made payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a, was negotiating settlements with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, and had received a final settlement offer from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f. She indicated that she should have that debt paid off within the next two months. Applicant explained that her delinquent debt was due to factors outside of her and her spouse\u2019s control: a serious car accident involving their children in February 2006, and a business failure in August 2006 followed by unemployment and underemployment. Applicant cited improvements in their financial situation and her intent to resolve the debts without resorting to bankruptcy. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits admitted into the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 40-year-old married mother of three children, sons age 7 and 11 and a daughter born in September 2008. She has been employed by a defense contractor as a senior administrative assistant since March 2008, and seeks her first security clearance (Ex. 1).

While some of the debt was incurred for a now closed mortgage business,\nApplicant has a track record of late payments on living expenses that raises concerns\nfor her ability to manage her finances and to repay the delinquent debt in the\nforeseeable future. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on April 2, 2008. On February 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny her\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\nJuly 23, 2009\n\n2\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn February 20, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On April 16, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for May 8, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) were\nadmitted without any objections. A chart concerning the debts, marked as a hearing\nexhibit, was submitted as a supplement to the government\u2019s oral closing argument.\nApplicant testified on her behalf, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on\nMay 14, 2009. Applicant also offered three exhibits (Ex. A-C), to which the government\nhad no objections. Exhibits A and B were admitted. Admission of Exhibit C was\ncontingent on Applicant providing a copy on or before May 15, 2009, as she wanted to\nretain the original document.\nOn May 13, 2008, Applicant submitted a copy of Exhibit C by facsimile, and it\nwas entered into the record. In her forwarding correspondence, she described recent\nsettlement offers (Ex. D), and moved for the admission of a character reference letter\nreceived after the hearing (Ex. E). Department Counsel filed no objections by the May\n22, 2009, due date for a response, and the documents were admitted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent debt totaling $72,027 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). Applicant admitted the debt,\nalthough she averred she had made payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a, was\nnegotiating settlements with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, and had received\na final settlement offer from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f. She indicated that she should\nhave that debt paid off within the next two months. Applicant explained that her\ndelinquent  debt was due to factors outside of her and her spouse\u2019s control: a serious\ncar accident involving their children in February 2006, and a business failure in August\n2006 followed by unemployment and underemployment. Applicant cited improvements\nin their financial situation and her intent to resolve the debts without resorting to\nbankruptcy.\nAfter considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits admitted into the record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old married mother of three children, sons age 7 and 11\nand a daughter born in September 2008. She has been employed by a defense\ncontractor as a senior administrative assistant since March 2008, and seeks her first\nsecurity clearance (Ex. 1).\nIn August 2004, Applicant and her spouse opened a video and web business out\nof their home (Ex. 1). Around that same time, Applicant\u2019s spouse got involved in a multi-\n\nApplicant believes these partners responded to an advertisement placed by the corporate\n1\nheadquarters (Tr. 91).\nApplicant estimated that three-quarters of the debt balances in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e were for\n2\nbusiness expenses (Tr. 87). She testified that she had opened the account in SOR \u00b6 1.b in her name, but later\nadded her spouse as an authorized user (Tr. 105).\nApplicant testified initially that her spouse handled the family\u2019s finances, including between 2006 and\n3\nJuly 2008 (Tr. 66). She later clarified that she took over the finances from 2004 until mid-2007 when she felt\noverwhelmed (Tr. 103). The debts at issue became delinquent during that time. \n3\nlevel marketing mortgage lending company that was based in a distant state. As branch\nmanager/owner, he opened a suburban branch, at which he maintained his primary\noffice and controlled the day-to-day operations. He opened a second branch in an urban\nlocale that was managed by four partners, each of whom had put up a share of the\nfunds to operate the business (Tr. 89-90).  Applicant\u2019s spouse put up at least $10,000,\n1\nlargely on Applicant\u2019s personal credit, to establish the two branches (Tr. 97, 99).\nApplicant had been unemployed for a year. She went to work as an executive assistant\nfor her spouse in the suburban branch, although she also helped out at the urban\nbranch (Ex. 1). Her spouse continued to retain his position in sales at a local radio\nstation while getting established in the mortgage business. He had no previous\nexperience in the industry (Tr. 92).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse took cash advances against her account in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and\nhe charged some expenses for the mortgage business using her personal credit (Tr. 87,\n99).  Her spouse opened utility accounts (e.g., telephone) in his own name for the\n2\nmortgage business (Tr. 29). Applicant or her spouse or both also traveled on personal\ncredit to Las Vegas and to Texas to do corporate events for their home-based\nmedia/video business (Tr. 87). Her spouse did not open a business credit card account.\nAccording to Applicant, their business partners were supposed to reimburse them\nmonthly for expenses but failed to keep up with their obligations (Tr. 88, 96-97).\nIn February 2006, Applicant\u2019s two sons were involved in a serious car accident\nwith their nanny, who died as a result of her injuries. The children suffered primarily\nemotional trauma. Applicant began to work from home and reduced her hours to about\n20 a week as she cared for them and took them to mental health counseling (Tr. 30, 48-\n50, 52-53). The costs were covered by their insurance for the most part, although there\nis one outstanding bill that the insurer is refusing to pay (Tr. 51). Applicant and her\nspouse had to retain legal counsel to obtain coverage for some of the costs associated\nwith the accident and the attorney\u2019s final bill has not yet been paid (Tr. 52).\nApplicant handled the family\u2019s finances from 2004 to mid-2007 (Tr. 103).  She\n3\nstopped paying on some of their financial obligations, including on some credit card\naccounts that were solely in her name. The lender in SOR \u00b6 1.b charged off a\ndelinquent balance of $37,644 due to nonpayment after May 2006 (Exs. 4, 5). As of July\n2006, Applicant\u2019s credit card account in SOR \u00b6 1.e was closed because she was 150\ndays past due. As of March 2008, the account was in collection with a balance owed of\n$14,903 (Ex. 5). She made no payments on their joint Discover card account after July\n\nApplicant testified that the partners barred her spouse from access to the urban branch and contacted\n4\nthe police (\u201cThey took our personal belongings, our wedding photos, you know, anything that we had\npersonally in the office. The police came and said my husband could not take a single thing out of the office,\nit got really nasty and my husband feared for our lives, so we had to keep a baseball bat at our door because\nit got so bad.\u201d Tr. 90). She testified threats were made against their family and she wanted to file a complaint\nwith the police, but that her spouse did not want to aggravate the situation (Tr. 100).\n4\n2006. As of September 2008, the outstanding balance of that debt had reached $3,789\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Exs. 4, 5).\nIn August/September 2006, the state terminated the rights of the national\nmortgage lender to operate within its boundaries. All branch offices, including those\nowned by Applicant\u2019s spouse, had to cease operations until further notice (Tr. 28). Over\nthe next few months, Applicant and her spouse hoped that the business license of the\nout-of-state mortgage company would be reinstated and they would be allowed to\nresume operations (Tr. 55). Checks from her spouse\u2019s partners began to be returned for\ninsufficient funds (Tr. 92-93). Applicant\u2019s spouse continued to pay the overhead costs of\nthe suburban and urban branches, largely with personal savings until December 2006,\nwhen he decided to close the business (Ex. 2). He closed the suburban office, but his\npartners at the urban branch resisted and became affiliated with another mortgage\nlender (Tr. 28-29, 90-91).  Applicant was left with substantial debt on her personal credit\n4\ncard accounts, some of which was incurred for the mortgage business. Until September\n2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse received some residual income from the national mortgage\nlender on mortgage loans closed outside the state (Tr. 28, 48, 56), but even with their\nvideo and web business, they were unable to cover all their financial obligations (Tr.\n56).\nApplicant stopped making payments on her credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c by\nFebruary 2007. As of October 2007, she owed a collection balance of $12,305 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c) (Exs. 4, 5). A gasoline credit card account on which Applicant owed $2,000 was\nclosed by the credit grantor (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for nonpayment since December 2006 (Exs. 4,\n5). Applicant and her spouse also began to fall behind in late 2006 on a joint auto loan\nof $24,548 that they had taken out in May 2004 for a Nissan Pathfinder. As of March\n2008, the loan was 60 days past due for the third time (not alleged in SOR) (Ex. 5). In\nabout August 2007, they began to fall behind on their mortgage. As of late 2007, their\nmortgage loan was 60 days past due but they brought it current by February 2008 (Ex.\n5). On January 4, 2008, Applicant was given the option of settling a delinquent gasoline\ncredit card debt of $615.66 (SOR 1.f) for a lump sum payment of $61.57 or five\npayments of $24.63 (Ex. 3). She did nothing about the debt until March 2009.\nFollowing the closure of his mortgage office, Applicant\u2019s spouse worked for his\nbrother\u2019s employer in the mortgage industry from December 2006 to September 2007\n(Ex. 2), when he returned to his previous job at the radio station because he was not\nbringing enough income into the home to sustain their family (Tr. 30, 57). In mid-2007,\nApplicant turned over handling of the family\u2019s finances to her spouse because she was\noverwhelmed (Tr. 104), even though she was unemployed. She had not found an\nadministrative position that would allow her to be at home after school (Tr. 57). In July\n2007, Applicant and her spouse traveled to the Bahamas (Ex. 1), but it was paid for by\n\n5\nher father-in-law\u2019s travel agency in return for some videotaping work (Tr. 82-83). By\nSeptember 2007, Applicant realized that she had to bring in income, and she went to\nwork for her brother-in-law\u2019s employer at reduced hours, albeit reluctantly since she was\nnot a talented salesperson (Ex. 3, Tr. 59). She worked  on commission and closed only\none mortgage over the few months she was there (Ex. 3, Tr. 59).\nIn March 2008, Applicant began working for her current employer (Ex. 1, Tr. 31).\nShe and her spouse established a new budget and a plan to save $100 per pay period.\nShe also set up a 401(k) at work for her retirement (Ex. 2). That same month, the\ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a obtained a $4,362.75 judgment against her, and placed a lien\nagainst their home. In late March 2008, their 2004 model-year vehicle was repossessed\nafter they fell behind in their payments.\nOn April 2, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP for a security clearance. She\ndisclosed the judgment and lien awarded the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the very recent\nrepossession of their vehicle, although she explained that she and her spouse were in\nthe process of gathering the funds needed to redeem the car by April 10, 2008. In\nresponse to the financial delinquency inquiries, Applicant listed the judgment and car\nrepossession debts and some credit card debts ($12,305 on SOR \u00b6 1.c, $2,000 on SOR\n1.d, $37,644 on SOR \u00b6 1.b, and $13,794 on SOR \u00b6 1.e). As for being a party to any\npublic civil court actions in the last seven years, Applicant listed the judgment lien, but\nalso that they were still awaiting a settlement for their sons\u2019 injuries in the February\n2006 car accident (Ex. 1). On April 7, 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse paid $1,885.16 to\nredeem their 2004 Nissan Pathfinder from repossession (Ex. 2).\nOver the January to May 2008 time frame, Applicant and her spouse incurred\nmedical costs of about $2,413.72 not covered by insurance (Ex. A). Applicant disputed\ntheir responsibility for most of the debt (Ex. 2).\nApplicant and her spouse got behind on their mortgage in April and May 2008.\nThe mortgage lender offered them a means to bring their loan current by signing a\npromissory note for the $5,992.49 past due. On May 28, 2008, Applicant her spouse\nagreed to resume regular payments of their mortgage immediately, and starting in\nDecember 2008, to make regular installment payments of $48.49 per month on the\npromissory note in addition to their mortgage payments. Two days later, the mortgage\nlender issued a notice of intention to foreclose on their mortgage. They avoided\nforeclosure by making their subsequent monthly payments of $2,059.44 on time (Ex. 3).\nOn May 19, 2008, the agency holding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e offered to settle the\n$15,674.96 balance on receipt of a lump sum payment of $7,053.73. On June 16, 2008,\nApplicant sent letters to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. She offered to pay\n10% of the outstanding balances of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d at $25 per\nmonth and \u00b6 1.c at $50 per month). Applicant offered to pay $1,200 at $50 per month to\nsettle the $37,644 debt balance of SOR \u00b6 1.b. Her payments would be contingent on\nthe creditors waiving interest and removing any negative information from her and her\nspouse\u2019s credit records. Applicant asked both the original creditor of SOR \u00b6 1.c  and the\nagency collecting the debt to cease contacting her at work about the debt because she\n\nIn her letter to the creditor, Applicant increased her offer to $2,461. However, in her settlement offer\n5\nto the collection agency, she reiterated her previous settlement offer of 10% or $1,230.50 (Ex. 3).\nApplicant testified they got stuck with paying the copier lease of $5,000 (\u201cIt jumped from, I thought\n6\nit was $3,500 and it ended up being $5,000.\") (Tr. 86). She told DOHA in August 2008 that they were under\na plan to make $500 payments per month until the $3,500 balance was paid off (Ex. 3).\n6\nhad been reprimanded by her employer because of their calls. Applicant\u2019s creditors had\nnot responded to her offers by July 18, 2008, so she sent second letters offering to\nsettle SOR \u00b6 1.a for $1,308.82 (up from $436.28), \u00b6 1.b for $3,764.40 (up from $1,200),\nand \u00b6 1.c for $2,461 (up from $1,230.50 ). Also, on July 18, 2008, Applicant offered to\n5\nsettle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for 10% of the original balance of $13,794 at $50 per\nmonth. Over the next few weeks, she sent followup letters to the creditors in SOR \u00b6 1.d\nand 1.e, offering again to resolve the debts at 10% of the original balances. On August\n7, 2008, a new assignee of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c requested payment of the $12,305.24\nfull balance from Applicant (Ex. 3).\nIn the summer of 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse paid $1,500 toward a $3,500 copier\ndebt for his former business,  and they paid for summer camp for their two sons (Ex. 3).\n6\nIn July 2008, Applicant incurred late charges on three department store revolving\ncharge accounts for failure to make a payment the previous month (Ex. 3). On July 29,\n2008, the court ordered Applicant and her spouse to pay $25 per month on the\njudgment owed the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a, pending a hearing on the matter scheduled\nfor December 1, 2008 (Ex. 2). Applicant, who gave birth to their third child (a daughter)\nin late September 2008 (Tr. 73), did not make any payments on the debt until December\n2008, because she was out of work for six weeks on unpaid maternity leave (Tr. 71).\nShe paid for a short-term disability benefit but found out she was ineligible to collect as\nshe had not been with her employer for a year (Tr. 71). \nDOHA sent financial interrogatories to Applicant on July 19, 2008, requesting that\nshe document any payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.e. On August 14, 2008,\nApplicant forwarded copies of her current monthly bills (utilities, school tuition, summer\ncamp, mortgage), medical bills, and her efforts to reach settlements on her delinquent\ncredit card debt. She provided evidence of her and her spouse\u2019s employment income, of\njoint  savings and checking balances totaling $2,205, and of the value ($1,764.74) of her\n401(k). She estimated a net monthly remainder of $1,014.52, including a monthly\npayment of $25 on SOR \u00b6 1.a but excluding any payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b\u20131.e. Applicant indicated that she and her spouse had taken specific actions to get\nback on track financially. She had acquired stable employment and they had restarted\ntheir home-based web and video business for extra income. They had redeemed their\nNissan vehicle from repossession and had averted foreclosure of their mortgage. Her\nspouse was paying on the copy machine debt from their failed mortgage business. They\nhad brought current some bills, and were working to bring current their heating oil,\ncellular phone, and outstanding medical debts. She added that they planned to put up\ntheir home for sale, and would use any equity to pay off their debts. Applicant\nvolunteered that her spouse had been in a car accident with their 2001 Honda on\nAugust 6, 2008, and they were waiting to see whether the car could be repaired or\nwould have to be replaced (Ex. 3). The vehicle was subsequently determined to be\n\nApplicant testified on May 8, 2009, that the creditor owed the $37,644 offered to settle for 30% of the\n7\nbalance (Tr. 67). On May 13, 2009, she indicated that she had just received an offer to settle the debt for 10%\nof the balance (Ex. D). She presented no documentation from the creditor corroborating the offers.\n7\ntotaled and they bought a used 1998 model year minivan to replace it. They owe\nnothing on that vehicle (Tr. 77).\nIn August 2008, Applicant and her spouse were billed $6,300 in reduced tuition\nfor their two sons who attend a private school. They received financial aid of $3,928 for\nthe upcoming school year. As of July 25, 2008, Applicant and her spouse had just\nfinished paying their tuition and extended care obligation for the 2007-08 school year\n(Ex. 3).\nOn December 23, 2008, Applicant paid $75 on the Discover card judgment debt\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) for October through December 2008. On February 3, 2009, she paid $25\nfor January 2009. She paid $25 for February on the 27  of the month (Ex. B). After\nth\nApplicant missed her payment for March 2009, the creditor obtained a court order to\ngarnish her wages. Applicant had the order rescinded, and on April 15, 2009, an\n\u201cagreement for judgment\u201d in the amount of $4,678.70 was awarded the creditor.\nApplicant is under court order to repay the debt at $25 per month beginning April 30,\n2009, in return for waiver of future interest, provided her payments are made on time\n(Tr. 41, 72-73). In the event of a default, interest is to accrue from March 8, 2008 (Ex.\nC). On April 28, 2009, she paid the creditor $50 (Ex. B).\nIn mid-April 2009, Applicant\u2019s spouse was laid off from his job at the radio station.\nHe has since focused on their home-based video and web design business (Tr. 60). He\nwas collecting unemployment compensation of $750 per week (Tr. 61, 75). On March 3,\n2009, Applicant paid $61.57 to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f (Ex. A, Tr. 32). On April 30,\n2009, she paid $1,433.71 to pay off the car loan for the Nissan that had been redeemed\n(Ex. A, Tr. 32). The money came from their income tax refunds for 2008, which totaled\nabout $3,900 (Tr. 68-69). On May 8, 2009, Applicant paid $1,500 of her sons\u2019 school\ntuition. The remainder of the income tax refund monies was still in their bank account\n(Tr. 68-69). Applicant pays a friend from church $35 per day to care for her daughter\nwhile she is at work (Tr. 74). Applicant is employed full-time, although she has a\nmodified schedule under which she works nine-hour days one week followed by three\nnine-hour days and one eight-hour day the next week (Tr. 74).\nAs of May 2009, Applicant had not resolved those debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.e.\nApparently the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d have agreed to settle her accounts on\nreceipt of $3,765  and $1,000 (Tr. 32-33, 64), although there is no record documenting\n7\nthese offers. She plans to pay the $1,000 once she has the funds and then work on\nrepaying the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Ex. D). She has not had any contact with the\ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c since July 2008 (Tr. 69). Applicant is paying on three retail store\ncharge accounts as of May 2009 (Tr. 80). The accounts had been delinquent in July\n2008 (Ex. 3). Based on current expenses, Applicant estimates that she and her spouse\nhave a joint remainder of $1,000 per month even while he is collecting unemployment\ncompensation.

As of May 2009, Applicant and her spouse were behind a payment or\ntwo on their mortgage. They were seeking to refinance their adjustable rate loan into a\n30-year fixed loan that would lower their monthly obligation (Tr. 62). They had about\n$2,900 in savings/checking assets (Tr. 82). Asked about why they are continuing to fall\nbehind when they reportedly have $1,000 in discretionary funds each month, Applicant\ncited the costs associated with a newborn and a need to readjust their budget to get a\nhandle on their expenditures (Tr. 84). In an effort to reduce their expenses, they had\neliminated Internet access at home over a year ago (Tr. 92). Since they keep their\ncheck register in their computer, her spouse now takes his laptop to the library and\ndownloads their account information (Tr. 66). They also dropped their telephone land\nline at home, but have two cell phone accounts (Tr. 92-93). As of July 2008, Applicant\nhad a calling plan costing her $100 a month. Her spouse was with a separate carrier at\na monthly charge of $80 (Ex. 3). Applicant reduced the percentage of money she was\ninvesting in her 401(k) at work so that they would have more income for household\nexpenses (Tr. 94). To prevent unnecessary spending, she no longer carries her debit\ncard and has to clear any purchases with her spouse (Tr. 95). He is handling the\nfamily\u2019s finances. She trusts him to do so despite his poor choice of business partners in\nthe past (Tr. 101).\nApplicant and her spouse hold lay leadership positions in their church. She has\nbeen a member of the congregation since 1996. She has proven to the ministers and to\nothers in the church that she can keep information private and they consider her to\npossess high character and personal integrity (Exs. A, B, E). Applicant and her spouse\nhave signed up to take a financial course offered through their church in the fall in an\neffort to get out of debt as quickly as they can (Tr. 102).8\nApplicant is held in high regard by her work colleagues as well. She provides\nadministrative support to several project finance teams where she is known for an\nexcellent work ethic, teamwork, and commitment to the programs (Exs.

When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\n\n9\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nBetween May 2006 and February 2007, Applicant stopped paying on five of her\ncredit card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20141.e), and delinquent debts totaling about $70,641\nwere charged off or placed for collection or both. A $615.66 gasoline credit card debt, in\ncollection as of January 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) was settled for 10% of the balance ($61.57\npayment) in March 2009, but the other debts have yet to be resolved. As of May 2009,\n\n10\nthe aggregate balance of the unpaid accounts was about $72,000. Furthermore, in\nAugust 2008, she provided documentation showing she owed more than $2,000 in\nunpaid medical debt (not alleged in SOR). There is no proof that those debts had been\nresolved or her liability successfully disputed. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d are\nimplicated.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ncannot reasonably be applied. Her financial problems are extensive and ongoing. Just\nbefore she completed her e-QIP in April 2008, their car was repossessed for failure to\nmake timely payments. While she redeemed the vehicle within 30 days, they fell behind\nin their mortgage payments. They avoided foreclosure by executing a promissory note\nunder which they are required to pay $48.49 per month for 174 months in addition to\nmaking their regular mortgage payments. By May 2009, they were again behind in their\nmortgage.\nAG 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d applies, but only in part. The serious car\naccident in February 2006, the unexpected suspension of the national mortgage\nlender\u2019s license to operate in the state in 2006, and the denial of short-term disability\npay while Applicant was on maternity leave in the fall of 2008, negatively impacted her\nability to pay her financial obligations. However, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not mitigate the poor\nfinancial decisions that led to the incurring of substantial debt that became  delinquent in\n2006. They put up $10,000 largely on her credit to open two branches within a multi-\nlevel marketing organization in an industry in which her spouse had no previous\nexperience (Tr. 92). He entered into some type of partnership with four persons he did\nnot know but on whom he depended for the funds to run his mortgage business. He\ntook cash advances on her credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.b to pay office overhead costs. They\nused her credit for a trip to Las Vegas for their home-based video business. Nor does\nAG \u00b6 20(b) explain the repossession of their vehicle (albeit redeemed within 30 days) in\nApril 2008, the late charges in July 2008 on some of her retail credit card accounts, or\nher failure to make her $25 payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in March 2009.\nApplicant and her spouse had some financial help from consumer credit\ncounseling when they first moved to the area. But one has to question the value of that\nprevious association, given it did not prevent them from risking their own financial\nsolvency by entering into a multi-level mortgage marketing business on little more than\ncredit. Moreover, in lieu of settling the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d with their income tax refund,\nApplicant paid $1,500 of the refund toward their sons\u2019 private school tuition. Although\nnot frivolous expenditure, one has to question whether they can reasonably afford\nprivate school tuition when her spouse was recently laid off and they are currently\nbehind in their mortgage. Applicant and her spouse have taken some steps to reduce\ntheir expenses. She no longer carries her debit card and has to inform her spouse of\n\n11\nany intended purchases. At home, they have eliminated Internet access and their land\nline. They also registered for a financial class offered at their church this fall. However, it\nwould be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d when she has made little progress toward resolving her\ndelinquent debt.\nAG \u00b620(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies in very limited part. Her payments on her Discover\ncard debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) began after a judgment had been awarded the creditor in March\n2008 and a lien had been placed on their home, so it cannot be said that the payments\nwere completely voluntary. She missed her October and November 2008 payments\nwhen she was on maternity leave without pay. Although she paid $75 in December\n2008 to catch up, she made a late payment for January 2009 and she missed her\nMarch 2009 payment. She argued in closing (Tr. 119) that she had been notified that\nthe creditor was seeking to attach her wages, and she did not want to make a double\npayment. A creditor is not likely to resort to court action if timely payments are being\nmade. Even with respect to the settlement of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, the creditor offered\nto settle for $61.57 back in January 2008. Applicant did not pay the settlement amount\nuntil March 3, 2009. According to the income and expense figures she provided in\nAugust 2008, she should have been able to settle the debt sooner. Applicant proposed\nsettlement offers to her creditors last summer, but her failure to make any payments on\nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e undermine her case for mitigation under AG \u00b6\n20(d). She has had no contact with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c since July 2008.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\n\n12\nlaw, to establish that [she] has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that [she] has \u2018 . . . established a plan to\nresolve [her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nAssuming her spouse incurred about three-quarters of her delinquent debt in the\noperation of his mortgage business, Applicant is still responsible for the debt incurred in\nher name. She handled the family\u2019s finances when the accounts in the SOR became\ndelinquent, so the debt balances were known to her. In her favor, she has been open\nabout her financial problems with the government, and she has had more than her\nshare of unfortunate circumstances that have negatively affected her finances, including\nher spouse\u2019s recent layoff. But while she presented DOHA with a plan to resolve her\nfinancial problems in August 2008, she has not done enough under that plan to\novercome the concerns about her financial judgment. \nThe incurring of late charges on retail credit card accounts in July 2008, when\nshe and her spouse were working full-time, raise doubts about whether she can\nproperly manage her finances. As of May 2009, she and her spouse were again late in\ntheir mortgage payments despite the efforts they made to avert foreclosure in May\n2008. The creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e have offered settlements advantageous\nto Applicant, and she still has not made any payments to those creditors. Based on the\nfacts before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information at this time, notwithstanding\nher good work performance for the defense contractor.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed two delinquent consumer credit card debts of $5,326 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $6,147 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) as of December 2008, and a $75 debt in collection as of February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he answered the SOR, Applicant accepted responsibility for the three debts and indicated that the $75 debt had been paid in 2008. He fell behind because of costs associated with his younger son, who had legal problems related to substance abuse. Applicant expressed his intent to satisfy the debts with his income tax refund. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 48-year-old sheet metal mechanic, who has worked for a defense contractor most recently since February 2008 (Tr. 30). He had previously worked for the company from January 1980 until he was laid off in 1996 or 1997 (Ex. 1, Tr. 31, 96-97),1 and he held a secret-level security clearance for most of that employment (Ex. 1). Applicant and his spouse married in August 1981, and sons were born to them in March 1984 and August 1987 (Ex. 1, Tr. 26, 32-33, 82). In about December 1987, Applicant and his spouse bought their current residence, taking out a mortgage of $68,000 (Ex. 4). The home was built in the mid-to-late 1940s (Tr. 70), and they have refinanced their mortgage several times over the years to pay bills and for home improvements (siding, windows, remodeling) (Ex. 4, Tr. 69).

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant stopped paying on a credit card debt in 2006 when finances became\ntight because of unexpected legal and counseling costs for his younger son. He is\nsaving funds and plans to resolve the $6,378 balance as soon as he can determine who\nis presently entitled to collect it. Another creditor is not holding him legally responsible\nfor his spouse\u2019s $5,326 delinquent credit card balance, although the funds to repay it\nwill come out of their household income. These unresolved debts are not likely to cause\nApplicant to engage in illegal activity. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on February 6, 2008. On February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its preliminary decision\nto deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\nAugust 12, 2009\n\nApplicant indicated on his e-QIP that he worked with the defense contractor until May 1996 (Ex.1).\n1\nHe subsequently indicated in September 2008 (Ex. 2) and at his hearing (Tr. 97) that he was laid off in 1997.\n2\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn February 23, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 2, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. On May 4, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for May 27, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and\nfour Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted without any objections. Applicant, his\nspouse, and his brother-in-law also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on\nJune 8, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\ntwo delinquent consumer credit card debts of $5,326 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $6,147 (SOR \u00b6\n1.b) as of December 2008, and a $75 debt in collection as of February 2008 (SOR \u00b6\n1.c). When he answered the SOR, Applicant accepted responsibility for the three debts\nand indicated that the $75 debt had been paid in 2008. He fell behind because of costs\nassociated with his younger son, who had legal problems related to substance abuse.\nApplicant expressed his intent to satisfy the debts with his income tax refund. After\nconsidering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old sheet metal mechanic, who has worked for a defense\ncontractor most recently since February 2008 (Tr. 30). He had previously worked for the\ncompany from January 1980 until he was laid off in 1996 or 1997 (Ex. 1, Tr. 31, 96-97),1\nand he held a secret-level security clearance for most of that employment (Ex. 1). \nApplicant and his spouse married in August 1981, and sons were born to them in\nMarch 1984 and August 1987 (Ex. 1, Tr. 26, 32-33, 82). In about December 1987,\nApplicant and his spouse bought their current residence, taking out a mortgage of\n$68,000 (Ex. 4). The home was built in the mid-to-late 1940s (Tr. 70), and they have\nrefinanced their mortgage several times over the years to pay bills and for home\nimprovements (siding, windows, remodeling) (Ex. 4, Tr. 69).\nApplicant was active in his parish and community while his boys were young. A\nscout himself during his youth, Applicant attained the rank of Eagle Scout and continued\non as an adult leader, holding various positions at the troop, council, and district level\nover the years. His received several awards for his dedication to scouting (Ex. C, Tr. 59-\n62).\n\nApplicant apparently authorized a collection agency to withdraw $100 per week from his checking\n2\naccount to repay the debt until the account was emptied at which time he closed the account (Tr. 39).\nApplicant estimated about $1,000 was paid toward the debt. His February 2008 credit report shows that the\naccount was 60 days past due in September 2003, and 30 days past due in March 2004 and November 2005,\nwith last activity in June 2006. The payments could well have been made between November 2005 and June\n2006. As of February 2008, the account was in collection with a past due balance of $5,845 (Ex. 4). \n3\nAfter he was laid off by the defense contractor in 1996/97, Applicant worked as\nbuilding superintendent for his parish until December 2000 (Ex. 1). In January 2001,\nApplicant started working as a motor coach operator for a bus company (Ex. 1). The job\ntook him away from home for two to three weeks at a time (Tr. 50-51). His mother-in-law\nmoved into their household when she could no longer manage on her own due to\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (Tr. 65). Applicant\u2019s spouse was employed by their parish school at\n$7.50 per hour (Tr. 164) from about 2001 until 2004 when she decided to care for her\nmother full time (Tr. 65-66). In 2005,  her mother went into a nursing home because she\nneeded 24-hour care (Tr. 66). The nursing home costs were covered, but Applicant and\nhis spouse paid for personal care items for her mother (Tr. 67).\nIn about 2003, Applicant\u2019s younger son began to get involved with the wrong\ncrowd. He quit scouting and began to smoke marijuana and to drink alcohol (Tr. 59).  In\nMay 2005, Applicant\u2019s son was arrested twice by the local police for offenses related to\nunderage drinking and disorderly conduct (Ex. B).  Applicant paid a $2,500 retainer fee\nfor legal representation for his son (Tr. 41), and he covered the costs of court-ordered\nfines, counseling, and urinalysis testing for his son over the next two years. Applicant\u2019s\nson was discharged from various counseling programs and he was required to submit to\nurinalysis testing as frequently as three times weekly at one point for his failure to\nremain abstinent (Tr. 45). Applicant estimates that he paid $2,000 to $3,000 for his\nson\u2019s alcohol/drug screening and therapy (Tr. 47-48).\nIn October 2005, Applicant lost his job with the bus company due to a corporate\nacquisition and closure of his division (Tr. 101). Applicant was unemployed until January\n2006, when he went to work for a relative who had a video service company (Ex. 1, Tr.\n32, 52) at $20 an hour and no benefits (Tr. 103).  Applicant put in long hours for little\npay (Tr. 52).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse handled the family\u2019s finances (Tr. 34), with mixed results. A\ndelinquent credit card account of Applicant\u2019s (not alleged in the SOR) was settled for\nless than the full amount in 2004 (Exs. 3, 4). They had a history of occasionally falling\nbehind 30 to 90 days in their mortgage payments (Ex. 4). Their financial situation\nbecame tight in the fall of 2005 due to their son\u2019s legal costs. In November 2005,\nApplicant and his spouse were 30 days late on their $117,000 mortgage. They took out\nan adjustable rate mortgage loan of $147,000 (Ex. 4) to cover their expenses, but\ncontinued to have difficulties meeting all their obligations. Applicant was 30 days past\ndue on a retail credit card account as of November 2005 and no payments were made\nafter June 2006 on a balance of $4,513 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). As of February 2008, the account\nwas in collection with a $5,845 past due balance.  Applicant\u2019s spouse opened a credit\n2\ncard account with Applicant as an authorized user in February 2006. The credit grantor\nclosed the account due to nonpayment in October 2006, and by February 2008, the\n\nApplicant mistakenly indicated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was held by an electronics retailer rather\n3\nthan with the creditor he named on his e-QIP. There is no listing on Applicant\u2019s credit reports that would\nindicate he held an account with the electronics retailer.\n4\npast due balance was $5,326 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). In May 2006, a medical provider placed a\n$75 balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Ex. 4). Applicant was sickened with pneumonia\non the job and the insurer paid the debt in 2008 (Tr. 35-36).\nIn about October 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse began working for a home\nimprovement retailer full time as a sales specialist (Tr. 147). From February to June\n2007, Applicant held a second job with the home improvement company to supplement\nhis income (Ex. 1, Tr. 31, 52). In August 2007, Applicant submitted an application to\nreturn to work for the defense contractor at a different facility. He did not apply for a\nspecific position at that time (Tr. 98-99).\nIn about December 2007, Applicant left the employment of the video company\nafter he confronted his relative about income and unreimbursed mileage on his vehicle\nfor the job. An inquiry about the status of his job application with the defense contractor\nled to him being rehired at top rate (hourly wage $24.87, Tr. 100) with all his benefits\nrestored (Tr. 98-99). He completed an e-QIP on January 10, 2008 (signed on February\n6, 2008), on which he disclosed in response to the financial delinquency inquiries that\nhe was $3,700 in arrears on his mortgage, and owed about $5,000 on the retail credit\ncard debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He indicated that his mortgage would be brought current with\nhis income from his job or with his income tax refund, and that he was working to pay off\nhis other debt (Ex. 1).\nIn April 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about the\ndebts in the SOR. He admitted he had not made any payments on the two credit card\ndelinquencies, and expressed an intent to resolve them by the end of the year (Ex. 5).\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law died in late June 2008 (Ex. 2). Applicant and his\nspouse paid about $3,500 of the funeral expenses (Tr. 64). In August 2008, a law firm\nattempted to collect the balance of SOR \u00b6 1.b from Applicant (Ex. A), but he and his\nspouse were in arrears $3,759.75 on their mortgage at the time and he could not afford\nto pay the credit card debt. In September 2008, Applicant and his spouse accepted an\noffer from their lender to modify their mortgage loan to a 7% fixed rate loan with a new\nprincipal balance of $148,054.50. This loan modification brought their account current\nand lowered their monthly mortgage payment of principal and interest from $1,156.80 to\n$1,016.24 (Ex. 2). Accounting for escrow payments, their monthly mortgage is about\n$1,400 (Tr. 148). As of late September 2008, Applicant estimated he had $1,183.38 in\ndiscretionary funds each month after monthly expense and debt payments (Ex. 2, Tr.\n156). Payments were not being made on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b (Ex. 3).3\nWith the help of his brother-in-law, Applicant began contacting the creditors in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in January 2009 (Tr. 135), initially to verify the debts. In April 2009,\nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a notified Applicant that he was only an authorized user and was\nnot responsible for the debt (Ex. A). Applicant\u2019s spouse was the listed account holder\n\nA privacy notice included in the April 23, 2009, correspondence from the servicer of the debt\n4\n(company X) indicates that X and Y are two of 15 companies under the umbrella of a parent company (Ex.\nA).\n5\n(Tr. 117, 136). As of May 2009, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was still in negotiations with\nthe creditor about a possible settlement (Tr. 137).\nIn February 2009, a collection agent for the servicer (company X) of the debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b offered to settle the $6,237.08 balance on receipt of $3,118.54 within 45\ndays. In March 2009, Applicant received his income tax refund of about $6,000 for tax\nyear 2008 (Tr. 68-69, 107, 160). He deposited the funds in a savings account because\nhe could not determine to whom to send the money (Tr. 68, 108), and his spouse paid\ntheir mortgage out of those funds (Tr. 160). On March 25, 2009, Applicant sent letters to\nthe collection agency and the listed holder of the account (company Y) requesting\nverification of the debt. In response to a telephone inquiry from Applicant\u2019s brother-in-\nlaw (Tr. 125), the collection agency offered to settle the balance on receipt of $3,157.82,\npayable in a lump sum of $1,007 followed by six consecutive monthly payments of\n$358.47. Applicant did not settle the debt because he was not sure whether payment to\nthe collection agency on behalf of company X would resolve the debt owed to company\nY. On April 23, 2009, Applicant was informed by company X that the debt (balance\n$6,377.93) and had been recalled by company Y (Ex. A, Tr. 118).  As of late May 2009,\n4\ncompany Y had not responded to telephone calls or to a registered letter sent by\nApplicant about the debt in March 2009 (Ex. A). The original credit card lender had\nwritten off the debt and rebuffed Applicant\u2019s attempt at repayment (Tr. 122). Applicant\nremains able and willing to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b once he receives confirmation\nfrom a creditor that payment will legally satisfy the debt (Tr. 132). His plan is to resolve\nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b before his spouse\u2019s debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, in the hope that it would\nresolve the issue impeding his security clearance (Tr. 139-40). He is expecting overtime\nto be available at work in June/July 2009, which would give him additional income to\nresolve the debts (Tr. 57).\nApplicant and his spouse have been current on their mortgage since the loan\nwas modified (Tr. 148). They are still working on a family budget (Tr. 154). They\nrecently bundled their cable television and Internet services to reduce their monthly bill\n(Tr. 150). Applicant\u2019s spouse has a monthly car payment of $239 (Tr. 150) and a cellular\nphone bill of $120 per month (Tr. 152). Their present income is sufficient to meet their\nmonthly expenses (Tr. 162), although his spouse, who pays the bills, was unable to\nprovide specific figures (Tr. 162). Applicant, with the help of a friend, remodeled their\nkitchen in the last couple of years (Tr. 167). Applicant has not taken a vacation in the\nlast ten years (Tr. 70). Applicant has no active credit card accounts (Tr. 58). \nAs of May 2009, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was living with Applicant and his\nspouse and contributing to the household finances (Tr. 133, 153). Applicant\u2019s younger\nson is still at home but he does not contribute financially (Tr. 33, 53). He is working in a\nrestaurant about 30 hours a week (Tr. 55). Applicant paid more than $2,000 in tuition\nand books for his son for one semester at a local community college (Tr. 155).\nApplicant\u2019s older son is a health services technician in the Coast Guard. He was\n\n6\nawarded an achievement medal for superior performance of duty in October 2007. In\nAugust 2008, this son was commended by his state\u2019s senate for his distinguished\nservice on that date in October 2007 (Ex. D).  \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant owes a credit card debt of about $6,377.93 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on an account\nthat has been delinquent since 2006. Although he is not legally liable for the $5,326\ncredit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the funds to repay the debt will be coming out of the\nhousehold income, given it is his spouse\u2019s debt. Applicant\u2019s financial problems appear\nto be more extensive than the SOR would indicate, in that he and his spouse have had\nproblems over the years remaining current on their mortgage. As of September 2008,\nthey were in arrears $3,759.75 on their mortgage before their loan was modified. AG \u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot reasonably be\napplied. The delinquency is attributable in significant part to the legal problems of a\nrebellious teenager. However, since Applicant and his spouse have fallen behind at\ntimes on other expenses, including their mortgage, the fact that their son has been on\ngood behavior for the past two years does not completely alleviate the financial\njudgment concerns.\nAG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is clearly implicated. His household\nfinances were negatively impacted by his spouse having to leave her job with the school\nto care for her mother in 2004. From May 2005 to the fall of 2007, Applicant incurred\nsubstantial costs because of his son\u2019s substance abuse and related legal problems. In\nOctober 2005, Applicant lost his job when the bus company closed his division. While\nhe went to work for a family member in January 2006 at $20 an hour, there were issues\nregarding his pay and unreimbursed mileage for his vehicle used in the video business\nthat subsequently led him to leave that job in December 2007. He was rehired by the\ndefense contractor in December 2007, but he did not start working until February 2008.\nUnexpected circumstances continued even after he began his present employment, in\nthat he and his spouse had to pay about $3,500 of her mother\u2019s funeral expenses in late\nJune 2008.\n\n8\nAG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies to the extent that he has taken steps to bring his\nmortgage current and to determine to whom he should pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  After\nhis April 2008 interview, Applicant determined that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c had been paid.\nApplicant has demonstrated that his inaction until January 2009 on the other two debts\nwas not due to disregard. He reported that he and his spouse had $1,183.38 remaining\nat the end of the month as of September 2008, but this does not appear to be an\naccurate reflection of their finances at that point. He and his spouse had recently\nincurred the funeral expenses for her mother, and seen a spike in their monthly\nmortgage payment due to the adjustable interest rate which led the lender to modify\ntheir loan. Before the SOR was issued, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law began seeking\nverification of the debts. While Applicant has yet to make a payment toward resolving\nSOR \u00b6 1.b, it is reasonable for him to require written confirmation beforehand that\npayment to company Y, the listed current holder of the account, would satisfy the debt.\nApplicant approached the original lender with an offer of repayment but the debt had\nbeen written off and the retailer would not accept payment. As for the creditor in SOR \u00b6\n1.a, no efforts to collect will be forthcoming against Applicant, but he intends to resolve\nthat debt as soon as his debt is cleared.\nAG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d\napplies when viewing his financial situation as a whole. His spouse credibly testified that\nwith their joint income, they have been able to catch up on their obligations. Although\nthey have yet to finalize a budget, and there is some question about whether they have\na good handle on their finances, there is no evidence of extravagant expenditure or of\nnew delinquencies. They took some steps to reduce expenses by bundling their cable\ntelevision and Internet costs, and expressed a credible intent to resolve all outstanding\nfinancial obligations.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\n\n9\nlaw, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve\nhis financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case\nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant\u2019s financial struggles are due in part to financial naivete. By refinancing\ntheir mortgage several times, they improved their home and paid off some debts, but\nalso increased their debt obligation substantially. Yet, factors outside of their control,\nmost notably their son\u2019s legal problems, the costs incurred caring for his spouse\u2019s\nmother and then her funeral, and times of unemployment for Applicant and his spouse,\nhave significantly impacted their ability to remain current in all their obligations. As of\nMay 2009, Applicant had saved a portion of their joint income tax refund to pay off his\ndelinquent debt. Given his desire to retain the employment that he needs to support his\nfamily, he is likely to resolve the debt in the near future. His record of dedication to his\nemployer and to his community shows he is not likely to engage in illegal activities to\nobtain funds to resolve the delinquent debt.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 38-year-old man who has been employed as a heavy equipment operator by a defense contractor since December 2007. Applicant graduated from high school in 1989. He enlisted in the Army in November 1990, and he served continuously until he was released from active duty in July 1994. He possessed a secret security clearance while in the Army, and no adverse action was ever taken to revoke or downgrade that clearance. Applicant attended college from January until December 1999, and again from January 2002 to July 2003, but he did not receive a degree. Applicant\u2019s employment history before he began working for the defense contractor is as follows: 11/2007 to 12/2007 - unemployed; 03/2007 to 11/2007 - corrections officer; 10/2003 to 03/2007 - route driver/sales; 07/2003 to 10/2003 - unemployed; 10/2003 to 10/2003 - driver; 02/2002 to 06/2003 - administrative assistant; 12/2001 to 02/2002 - unemployed; 09/2001 to 11/2001 - administrative assistant; 01/2001 to 09/2001 - driver/sales; 10/1998 to 02/2001 - data transcriber; and 11/2000 to 01/2001 - administrative assistant.

He received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in\nMarch 2001. He quickly thereafter accumulated numerous delinquent accounts which he\nhas failed to take any meaningful action to resolve.\nOn December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on January 21, 2009. He\nadmitted all SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 19, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to me on February 5, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued\non March 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 22, 2009. The hearing was conducted\nas scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-4 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted 5 documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(AE) 1-5. AE 1, AE 2 & AE 5 were admitted into the record without objection. The\nGovernment\u2019s relevancy objections to AE 3 & AE 4 were sustained. The transcript was\nreceived on May 1, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 38-year-old man who has been employed as a heavy equipment\noperator by a defense contractor since December 2007. Applicant graduated from high\nschool in 1989. He enlisted in the Army in November 1990, and he served continuously\nuntil he was released from active duty in July 1994. He possessed a secret security\nclearance while in the Army, and no adverse action was ever taken to revoke or downgrade\nthat clearance. Applicant attended college from January until December 1999, and again\nfrom January 2002 to July 2003, but he did not receive a degree.  \nApplicant\u2019s employment history before he began working for the defense contractor\nis as follows: 11/2007 to 12/2007 - unemployed; 03/2007 to 11/2007 - corrections officer;\n10/2003 to 03/2007 - route driver/sales; 07/2003 to 10/2003 -  unemployed; 10/2003 to\n10/2003 - driver; 02/2002 to 06/2003 - administrative assistant; 12/2001 to 02/2002 -\nunemployed; 09/2001 to 11/2001 - administrative assistant; 01/2001 to 09/2001 -\ndriver/sales; 10/1998 to 02/2001 - data transcriber; and 11/2000 to 01/2001 - administrative\nassistant. \nApplicant submitted a work performance evaluation for the period ending November\n30, 2008, that indicates he is effectively performing his duties. He submitted a letter of\nrecommendation from a co-worker who has known him for over seven years. That person\nattests to Applicant being a respected member of the community and their church. He also\navers that Applicant is trustworthy and he possesses sound judgment. \n \nApplicant has been married since November 2004. He has four children from this\nrelationship, twin sons, age 9, another son, age 8, and a daughter, age 5. His wife has a\nson, age 14, who resides with them. Applicant attributes his financial problems to the\nvarious periods of unemployment he has experienced, medical expenses caused by the\npremature birth and extended post-delivery hospitalization of his twin sons, and his wife\u2019s\ndecision to stay home with the children after the twins were born. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in May 1999. That bankruptcy\nwas converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in December 2000, and Applicant obtained a\nChapter 7 discharge in March 2001. Applicant estimated the amount of debt discharged\nwas $15-20,000. He attributes his need to seek bankruptcy protection at that time to the\n\n3\nloss of a job and the reduction in pay he experienced when he found new employment at\na lower wage. \nThe largest debt listed in the SOR, subparagraph 1.l, arises from an automobile\nrepossession with an unpaid deficit owing of $14,407. Applicant\u2019s January 23, 2008 credit\nbureau report (CBR) discloses this account was opened in the month Applicant obtained\na bankruptcy discharge. The last activity on the account is listed as occurring a mere three\nmonths after he obtained the bankruptcy discharge. \nThe SOR alleges 14 accounts, including the account listed in subparagraph 1.l, that\nhave been submitted for collection and are owing in the total amount of $21,221; one\ncharge off account that is owing in the amount of $648; and two accounts in default that\nare owing in the combined amount of $12,824. The two default accounts arose from\nstudent loans. Applicant\u2019s November 9, 2008 CBR indicates claims have been filed against\nthe guarantor on these accounts. The SOR also alleges a judgment that was entered\nagainst Applicant in October 2004, owing in the amount of $360. Applicant admitted he is\nresponsible for each of these accounts and that he has not paid anything toward any of the\naccounts. \nApplicant testified he is a one-third owner in a house that once belonged to his now\ndeceased father and two other relatives. One of the other relatives is also now deceased\nand the third wants to sell the property under a federal government program enacted to aid\nhurricane victims. Applicant does not know how much money he will receive from the sale\nof the house or when he will receive his share of the proceeds from the sale of the house\nif the house is actually purchased under the program. He intends to apply the money he\nreceives from the sale to satisfy as much of his delinquent debt as possible. \nApplicant contacted a financial planning consultant sometime before the hearing\nand scheduled an initial meeting with the consultant two days after the hearing. The\npurpose of the scheduled consultation was to seek advice in establishing a budget and\nways to prevent Applicant and his wife from squandering any proceeds they may receive\nfrom the sale of his father\u2019s former residence. Applicant admits that he and his wife have\nnot wisely handled their financial affairs over the years and that they have been\nunsuccessful in their previous efforts to establish a budget. \nThe combined net monthly income of Applicant and his wife is approximately\n$4,200. She also receives $140 a month as child support. Their recurring monthly living\nexpenses are about $3,650, including car payments of $500 for a new vehicle purchased\nin January 2007, and $360 for a used vehicle purchased in February 2009. Applicant\ntestified that as of the date of the hearing he had $328 in a savings account and $462 in\na checking account.   \n   \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v.

Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\n\n5\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in March 2001. He purchased\nan automobile the same month he obtained the discharge, and three months later the\nautomobile was repossessed. The deficit on that account, owing in the amount of $14,407,\nwas placed for collection and remains outstanding. Applicant has 17 additional accounts,\nowing in the total amount of $20,646, that have been defaulted on, submitted for collection,\ncharged off as bad debts, or that resulted in a judgment being entered against him. Some\nof those accounts have been delinquent for at least several years. Applicant has not taken\nany meaningful action to resolve any of these accounts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations apply.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are due in part to the periods of unemployment he\nhas experienced over the years. They were further contributed to by the medical expenses\nthat accompanied the premature births of his twin sons and the need for his wife to stop\nworking in order to care for their children. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s twin sons were born in June 2000. After they were born, he\nobtained the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the chance to start with a clean financial slate.\nInstead of acting responsibly, he purchased a car he obviously could not afford as\nevidenced by it being repossessed within a few months. Since then, he has continued to\naccumulate debt he could not service. He admits he and his wife have been unsuccessful\nin living within any budget they attempt to establish. Indeed, as his recent automobile\npurchases illustrate, including the purchase of a second car after issuance of the SOR and\njust a few months before the hearing, he continues to spend the money he earns without\nconsideration of the delinquent debts he has accumulated. \nApplicant\u2019s proposed plans to resolve his financial problems involve application of\nthe proceeds from the sale of a house to the federal government and the meeting with a\nfinancial counselor a couple of days after the hearing. It is unknown when or if the house\nwill be sold. It is also unknown how much money Applicant will receive from the sale of the\nhouse if it does sell. Assuming Applicant kept the financial counseling appointment, it is\nunclear how that will help him out of his current financial distress considering the\nlongstanding nature of his financial problems and his inability to live within the budgets he\nand his wife have attempted to set for themselves in the past.     \nBased on the above, I find Applicant has not acted responsibly in addressing the\nproblems that created his delinquent accounts were resolved. Instead of making any\npayments toward his delinquent debt, even after issuance of the SOR, Applicant\npurchased a second vehicle. He continues to exhibit financial irresponsibility and poor\njudgment in resolving his delinquent debt, and he provides only vague and speculative\nproposals to rid himself of that debt. \nAccordingly, I conclude Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC 20(b): the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC 20(c): .\n. . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; and MC\n20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts do not apply. \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant failed to mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him nor\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Applicant answered the SOR 23 March 2009, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 4 May 2009, and I convened a hearing 4 June 2009. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) 12 June 2009.\n \nJune 30, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. He is a 22-year-old IT advisory\nassociate employed by a defense contractor since June 2008. He has not previously\nheld a clearance.\nApplicant used marijuana four times between July 2005 and April 2008. He used\nmarijuana in July 2005, August 2005, October 2005, and April 2008. The two times he\nused during summer 2005, he used with his next door neighbor\u2014a young man who\nlater enlisted in the U.S. Army, just returned from a tour of duty in Iraq, and no longer\nuses marijuana. He used marijuana in October 2005 with college classmates who he\nhas not seen since graduation. He used marijuana in April 2008 with college classmates\nfrom his freshman year\u2014during senior-year-end celebrations. Applicant testified\ncredibly that he knew immediately that he had made a mistake and left the company of\nhis classmates. He regretted his last use of marijuana and has not used marijuana\nsince. He has seen some of these college classmates at alumni functions since\ngraduation, but otherwise has no contact with them.\nThere is no record evidence of physiological or psychological impairment as a\nresult of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use. He never bought or sold marijuana, and has not\nbeen involved with illegal drugs other than marijuana. He took, and passed, drug\nscreening for two different employers in high school and his early college years.\nApplicant accepted an offer of employment from his current employer in fall 2007\nof his senior year. He disclosed his current drug history on a clearance application he\nexecuted in February 2008 (G.E. 1). He disclosed the same information during an April\n2008 subject interview (G.E. 2), but also disclosed his April 2008 marijuana use.\nApplicant stopped using marijuana in April 2008 because he realized that\ncontinued marijuana use was inconsistent with the professional career he hoped for. He\nhas not used since. After college, Applicant moved back home to live with his parents,\nbut plans to rent his own place once he can find a suitable roommate. He mostly\nsocializes with co-workers now. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future. He\nsigned a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\n(A.E. E).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor is aware of the clearance issues, but opines that\nApplicant\u2019s demonstrated trustworthiness and reliability on the job warrants his getting\nhis clearance. He has similar recommendations from a co-worker (A.E. D) and a college\nclassmate\u2014who himself is embarking on a professional career with the military. He has\nbeen commended for his work performance (A.E. C), and his performance evaluations\nconfirm his coworker and supervisor assessments (A.E. B).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00a7 25.(a) any drug abuse ; (c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\n3\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n\u00b6 26.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n4\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n3\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline H\n(Drug Involvement).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana on four occasions between October 2005\nand April 2008.  However, Applicant mitigated the security concerns, by demonstrating\n3\nthat the use was under circumstances unlikely to recur,  and further demonstrating\n4\n\n\u00b6  26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug\n5\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nDepartment Counsel argues, albeit not strongly, that drug use after completing a clearance application can\n6\nundercut claims of reform or rehabilitation\u2014consistent with Appeal Board rulings. I have given appropriate\nconsideration to this argument but find it unpersuasive on these facts. The appropriate disqualifying condition,\nwhich Department Counsel does not invoke, is use after being granted a clearance. Granting that completion\nof a clearance application puts an applicant on notice of the government\u2019s requirements regarding drug use,\nthe Appeal Board\u2019s reasoning gains more credence the closer the application is to the actual start of\nemployment or clearance grant. The reasoning loses credence where, as here, the application is completed\nmonths before the actual start of employment\u2014an employment probable, but not absolutely certain\u2014and\nwhile an applicant is still ensconced in the relatively care-free college environment.\n4\nintent to not abuse drugs in the future.  While Applicant\u2019s use is fairly characterized as\n5\n\u201crecent,\u201d this term has less meaning under the new adjudicative criteria, where the\ncorresponding language \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago. . .\u201d [\u00b6 26.(a)], is used in\nthe disjunctive with language that clearly applies to Applicant. Further,  his marijuana\nuse was clearly infrequent and confined to the years he was in college\u2014albeit including\nsummers with his neighborhood friend. Nevertheless, he seldom sees this college\nfriends or his neighbor now, and his neighbor has himself entered the military and\nforesworn his marijuana use. Finally, while his abstention from marijuana use since April\n2008 might not necessarily constitute an appropriate period of abstinence, given the\nminimal marijuana use by Applicant and his change in environment\u2014both physical\n(returning home) and psychological (career versus school)\u2014I conclude that this\nabstinence is appropriate [\u00b6 26.(b)]. Applicant also executed the sworn statement of\nintent. On this record, it is extremely unlikely that Applicant would return to illegal drug\nuse.  Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant. Additionally, this conclusion is\n6\ncompletely consistent with a whole person analysis.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

The allegations pertain to Applicant's history of alcohol abuse over \n25 years and poor judgment with respect to illegal drug use while holding a security \nclearance, solicitation of prostitutes, a robbery in which Applicant was the victim, and a \nworkplace sexual encounter in a secured area. He has not met his burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised under Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines G, Alcohol Consumption, and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 23, 2009, and elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 25, 2010. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was received by Applicant on February 11, 2010. He \nwas afforded a 30-day opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. As of March 26, 2010, he had not \nresponded. The case was assigned to me on March 30, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b61.a-1.c, 2.a, 2.d-2.g. He denied \u00b6 2.b. On \u00b6 2.c, he indicated \u201cI neither admit or deny, \nsee past statement.\u201d Applicant\u2019s response to \u00b6 2.c. will be treated as a denial. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and through \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He holds a master\u2019s \ndegree in mechanical engineering. He has never been married and has no children. He \nhas worked in the defense industry since 1983. He held a security clearance from 1983 \nthrough 2006, when his top secret sensitive compartmented access was revoked due to \nexcessive Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct, set out below. (Item 4; Item 5 at \nI-6, I-38, I-46.) \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of alcohol abuse. He was arrested in 1981 for driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was placed on probation for six months for this \noffense. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted consuming alcohol in excess and \nto the point of intoxication over a 27-year period, extending until at least 2008. \nAdditionally, alcohol was a factor in some of the instances discussed below. \n \n \nDuring the time Applicant possessed a security clearance, he engaged in a \nnumber of questionable activities. In approximately April 1984 through June 1985, \nApplicant used both marijuana and cocaine on six occasions. He indicated he used \ncocaine and marijuana infrequently \u201cfor a short duration after I left the university while \nemployed.\u201d Applicant again used an illegal substance, hashish, in November 2001. In a \nletter dated January 19, 2005, Applicant recounted an incident involving hashish to his \nsecurity office. He indicated that while vacationing in South America, he was offered a \nhome-made cigarette from a \u201cEuropean.\u201d Applicant inhaled from the lit cigarette and \u201cI \nnoticed the tobacco had been most likely laced with a narcotic, which I inadvertently \ninhaled.\u201d Applicant continued, \u201cAt that point I used poor judgment (likely due to being \nintoxicated), and I did take a few more puffs.\u201d Applicant was drinking alcohol and was \nintoxicated on this occasion. (Item 4 at 29-30; Item 5 at I-11, I-23, I-30, I-47.) \n \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s drug use, he has solicited prostitutes on two occasions. \nIn 1995, Applicant solicited the services of a female foreign national while vacationing \n\n \n3 \n \noutside of the United States. Applicant met the prostitute at a nightclub and paid her \n$100. In 2003, he solicited the services of a prostitute while in Las Vegas, Nevada. He \nwas intoxicated on both occasions. (Item 5 at I-12, I-21, I-25, I-28, I-48.) \n \n \nSimilarly, Applicant\u2019s alcohol use led to another precarious situation. In 2004, \nwhile vacationing in another South American country, Applicant went to a local bar close \nto his hotel. Prior to going out, he consumed a bottle of wine and two mixed drinks. \nDuring the course of the evening, he met two foreign females. They sat together and \nApplicant consumed several more beers. Applicant believes that one of the females \n\u201cspiked\u201d his beer with some type of knockout drug and later sprinkled the same drug \nonto his french-fries. After eating the fries, he felt strangely. The females brought \nApplicant to his hotel room. He remembers undressing and showering with one of the \nfemales. The next morning, he woke late and discovered he had been robbed of his \nvaluables. In a separate account, Applicant claimed the entire robbery took place within \n20 minutes. (Item 5 at I-9, I-11, I-21, I-24, I-25, I-28, I-47; Item 6 at I-72, I-75.) \n \n \nApplicant also disclosed that he had sex with his former girlfriend in his office \nlocated inside a secure area, presumable while holding a clearance. The encounter \noccurred during normal working hours. She was a cleared employee, although it is not \nclear from the record if she had access to the secured area. (Item 5 at I-6, I-12, I-48.) \n \n \n At the height of Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption in approximately late 2005 to \nearly 2006, he was consuming one pint of hard alcohol nightly, on weekdays. On \nweekends, he usually consumed even more alcohol, and became intoxicated. He \nclaimed that he drank in order to sleep. He typically would consume alcohol at home, \nalone, in order to avoid trouble, although he admitted to drinking and driving \napproximately twice a year, without detection by authorities. Applicant attributed his \nhighest levels of alcohol consumption to the deteriorating health and subsequent \npassing of close family members. After the revocation of his security clearance in 2006, \nApplicant sought alcohol counseling through his employee assistance program. He met \nwith a psychologist approximately eight times between August 1, 2006 and March 3, \n2007. Applicant terminated treatment when he felt he had his alcohol use under control. \nThe Government presented Applicant\u2019s records of treatment obtained from his \npsychologist, but the records contained no decipherable diagnosis. In a September 19, \n2008 letter, Applicant contended he \u201crefrain[ed] from hard alcohol consumption and \nradically chang[ed] the amount and patterns of alcohol consumption in general\u201d but he \ncontinued to consumed beer and wine in moderation. However he failed to provide any \ninformation about his current, 2010, levels of alcohol consumption. (Item 3; Item 4; Item \n5 at I-1, I-10, I-12, I-14, I-22-24, I-29, I-46-47, I-50; Item 6 at I-72, I-76; Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant presented no letters of support. Records indicate that he had two \nsecurity clearance violations during the period he possessed a clearance, including \nbring home a classified document and inadvertent disclosure of classified information. \n(Item 5 at I-I49.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. (AG.) In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for Alcohol Consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n \nApplicant has been involved in several incidents away from work in which alcohol \nplayed a role. Clearly, his 1981 DUI conviction, along with his admission of continuing to \ndrive after becoming intoxicated approximately twice a year, raises security concerns. In \naddition, he repeatedly found himself in precarious situations, due to his alcohol abuse \nand poor judgment while consuming alcohol. His use of poor judgment while under the \ninfluence of alcohol away from work is disqualifying under AG \u00b6 22 (a). \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant engaged in a pattern of habitually consuming alcohol to \nthe point of intoxication over a 27-year period. It is clear from Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand medical record that his alcohol consumption has been excessive. Disqualifying AG \n\u00b6 22 (c) applies. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 23, the following mitigating factors are potentially relevant:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s habitual consumption of alcohol was recent, frequent, likely to \nreoccur, and casts doubt on his judgment. Over half of his life, Applicant has engaged in \nexcessive alcohol use. While Applicant indicated that he significantly curtailed his \nalcohol use in 2006 to 2008, with no reported incidents in the subsequent two to four \nyears, in this instance, I cannot find that \u201ca significant period of time has passed without \nany evidence of misconduct,\u201d in light of his long history with alcohol. ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4 2004). Additionally, there is no credible record evidence \nthat reflects Applicant\u2019s current level of alcohol consumption has declined, other than \nhis 2008 self-serving statement that he consumes beer and wine in moderation. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol related incidents cast serious doubt on his judgment. He has chosen \nto make poor choices while intoxicated including several instances of driving drunk. AG \n\u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has, in part, acknowledged his alcohol abuse and sought treatment to \novercome his alcohol problem. However, Applicant has failed to demonstrate \nresponsible use or abstinence. Applicant may have ceased consuming hard alcohol in \n2006, but he continued to consume beer and wine. Additionally, he provided no updated \nrecord to show his current level of consumption. Therefore, AG \u00b6 23(b) is not applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply because Applicant made no claim that he is currently \nparticipating in counseling or a treatment program. Applicant has the burden to present \nevidence to support the mitigating condition and he failed to offer any evidence in \nsupport. ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nThe record is devoid of evidence that would allow for the applicability of AG \u00b6 \n23(d). While Applicant participated in alcohol counseling from August 1, 2006, to March \n3, 2007, the records offered by the Government provided no indication that Applicant \nsuccessfully completed his treatment and contained no clear diagnosis or prognosis. \nFurther, Applicant terminated treatment when he decided his problem was under \ncontrol. He provided no evidence to suggest that his psychologist agreed with his \ndecision. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s alcohol problem, he has made a number of decisions \nthat reflect poorly on his character. Applicant exercised questionable judgment when he \nused illegal substances while holding a clearance in 1984-1985 and again in 2001, \nwhen he engaged the services of prostitutes in 1995 and 2003, and when he had sexual \nrelations during business hours in his secured-area office with his former girlfriend. \nApplicant\u2019s history of irresponsible behavior and questionable judgment makes him \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. His irresponsibility has made him a \ntarget for robbery in the past, and without corrective action, leaves him vulnerable in the \nfuture. AG \u00b6 16(c) and \u00b6 16(d) apply. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating factors are potentially relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n8 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s lapses in judgment were all serious and significant instances that \noccurred over a long period of time. Each indiscretion casts doubt on his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Taken together they show a pattern of inappropriate behavior \ndemonstrating questionable judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness indicating he \nmay not safeguard properly protected information. Additionally, not enough time has \npassed to establish that Applicant will refrain from his 27-year pattern of poor decision \nmaking. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has acknowledged that he has made poor choices in the past, but has \nnot demonstrated any positive steps to change his behavior, other than his brief alcohol \ntreatment. The alcohol treatment is not mitigating because he did not present evidence \nthat he successfully completed treatment and he continues to consume wine and beer. \nFurther, not all of the incidents of poor judgment involved alcohol. There was no alcohol \nuse indicated in Applicant\u2019s sexual encounter with his then girlfriend in his office. AG \u00b6 \n17(d) does not apply. \n \n \nLikewise, AG \u00b6 17(e) is inapplicable. Applicant contended that he took positive \nsteps to reduce his alcohol consumption from 2006-2008. However, we don\u2019t know what \nlevel he actually reduced it to, nor does the record reflect what his current level of \nalcohol consumption is. Further, as noted above, alcohol was certainly a contributing \nfactor in most instances of poor judgment, but not all instances. Applicant failed to show \nhow he had reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but warrant additional comment. Applicant \noffered no letters in support of his application. He is an educated and mature man who \nhas worked in the defense industry for 27 years. He has had two security clearance \nviolations. \n \nAlthough Applicant had been entrusted with a high level security clearance, his \nbehavior from 1983 through 2006 reflected a disregard for the high standards that \ncomes with the responsibility of holding a security clearance. He chose to engage in \ndrug use, solicit prostitutes, disrespect his workplace (by having sexual relations in his \noffice amidst classified materials), and consume great quantities of alcohol. He has \noffered little evidence to suggest that he now takes the responsibilities of holding a \nsecurity clearance seriously. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Alcohol Consumption and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 22, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on a date uncertain.  On March 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 31, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The matter was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on April 16, 2009, and then transferred to a second Administrative\nJudge on May 4, 2009.  The matter was transferred to the undersigned  Administrative\nJudge on May 19, 2009.  Notices of hearings were issued on May 6, 2009, and July 13,\n2009, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on August 18, 2009.  The Government\n\n2\npresented four Exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were\nreceived without objection. The Applicant presented two Exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, which were received without objection.  Applicant also\ntestified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August\n25, 2009.  The record remained open until close of business on August 25, 2009, to\nallow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant\nsubmitted nine Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1\nthrough 9, which were received without objection. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 49 years old and has a Master\u2019s Degree in Business.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Business Development Manager, and is\napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant admitted the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR).  The Applicant is an honorably discharged veteran\nof the United States Navy.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 7).  He has held a security\nclearance for thirty years with no security violations.\nThe Applicant has been working for the current defense contractor for about\ntwenty years.  During this period he has never violated security policy or procedures of\nthe company, even though he has abused alcohol at times.  Applicant testified that he\nstarted drinking alcohol at the age of seventeen.  He usually drank beer or wine on the\nweekends.  After graduating from high school, he joined the Navy and his consumption\nof alcohol increased.  In the Navy, he typically drank three nights a week when he was\nnot at sea, consuming three to six beers or more at each sitting.  As time passed, the\nApplicant realized that his drinking had steadily increased to the point where he was\nconsuming alcohol every night.  He believed that he was turning into an alcoholic, so he\nsought out professional help.  \nFrom December 2002, to March 2003, the Applicant voluntarily participated in a\nthree month outpatient treatment program for alcohol abuse.  (Government Exhibit 4).\nHe found the program to be very helpful.  During the treatment, the Applicant was\ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent.  He learned from this program that he had evolved\nover time to be an alcoholic.  The program provided him with tools and procedures to\n\n3\nhelp him discontinue his alcohol consumption.  Following this treatment program, the\nApplicant did not consume alcohol for several years.  (Tr. p. 27).  The Applicant was\neventually confronted with stressful situations involving a transfer to a more difficult job\nin the company on a troubled program.  His personal relationship was troubled, among\nother things, and so he started drinking again to relieve the stress.  He phased into\ndrinking, and before long, found himself drinking a half of bottle of wine or more every\nnight.  \nAgain, the Applicant did not like his excessive drinking and in February 2005, the\nApplicant voluntarily entered an alcohol rehabilitation treatment program.  (Government\nExhibit 4).  He was again diagnosed with alcohol dependence.  The Applicant stated\nthat this second treatment program has more of an emphasis on relapse and how to\nprevent it from happening.  (Tr. p. 30).  Following this treatment program, the Applicant\nreduced his drinking to almost nothing, but had a few glasses of wine at parties or social\nevents.  In March 2009, he decided to quit drinking completely.  (Tr. p. 31).\nThe Applicant testified that he has made some drastic changes in his life that\nhave helped him with his sobriety.  For one, he is no longer single.  He got married in\nMay 2008, to a woman who is a social drinker, but has not consumed alcohol since they\ngot married, due to a nerve condition.  Applicant is now very busy and has no desire to\ndrink.  He exercises, rebuilds cars, trucks and motorcycles, bike rides and goes fishing.\n(Tr. P. 45).  Although his consumption of alcohol has never caused him any problems at\nwork or in the public (except for a ticket he received for an open container as a youth\nmany years ago), he now realizes the serious dangers involved in alcohol abuse and\nwants no part of it.  If he finds a problem staying sober, he will join Alcoholics\nAnonymous and become involved.  (Tr. p. 45).   \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Manager, Security Lead, wife\nand other professional colleagues and friends, who know the Applicant well, attest to his\nprofessionalism, technical knowledge, trustworthiness, strong moral character, high\nintegrity, consciousness and honesty.  His meticulous attention to detail and\nthoroughness in protecting classified information is specifically noted.  He is\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and\n9).      \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n4\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n23.  (b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\n\n5\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR.\n\n6\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(c), \u201chabitual or\nbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether\nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d applies.\nHowever, given the isolated nature of the Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse, Mitigating\nCondition 23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser) also applies. \nThe Applicant\u2019s thirty year history of alcohol abuse includes the fact that he has\nbeen diagnosed as being alcohol dependent.  Following his last treatment program in\n2005, he  significantly reduced his drinking.  He no longer drinks irresponsibly and has\nnot done so for at least four years.  In March 2009, he decided to discontinue his use of\nalcohol altogether.  He states that he will never drink again.  This case is unique in that\nthe Applicant has never had any problems related to his consumption of alcohol, either\nat work or in public.  When his drinking became abusive to him, he voluntarily entered\ninto treatment to address it.  This self awareness is unusual, and the Applicant is\ncommended for it.  The Applicant has decided that alcohol no longer has a place in his\nlife and he has been completely sober for five months.  He plans to continue his\nsobriety.  I have found the Applicant to be forthright, candid and sincere throughout the\nproceeding.  Based upon his convincing testimony, demeanor, and commitment to\nremain alcohol free in the future, along with the evidence in mitigation, as reflected by\nthe favorable statements from his professional colleagues and friends, as well as his\npast record of security worthiness, there is sufficient evidence in the record to show that\nhe is sufficiently trustworthy at this time.  The likelihood of his misconduct in the past\nbeing repeated is nil.\n     \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may properly safeguard classified information.  Accordingly Guideline G is\nfound for the Applicant.  In the event that the Applicant continues to abuse alcohol, his\nsecurity clearance will be in serious jeopardy.\n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the SOR.\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\nCONCLUSION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM submitted by the Government, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old. He married in 1988 and divorced in 1990, and listed no children on his January 2008 security clearance application.4 He received an Associate in Science degree in 1986. Since 1997, he has worked as a network technician, machine operator, printing press operator, cellular technician, microwave technician, and in construction. Many of these jobs were short-term. In November 2007, he began working in his current position as an electronics technician, and submitted his security clearance application shortly after. This is his first application for a security clearance (Item 4). Applicant earns an hourly wage of $15. In his Personal Financial Statement (PFS) of July 2008, he lists gross monthly wages of $2,674, which equals approximately $32,000 gross annual income. Applicant's wage statement for the two-week period of August 19 \u2013 31, 2008, lists 147 hours, indicating that he works overtime. After deductions, his net monthly income is $1,526. Applicant listed $1,390 in monthly expenses in his PFS, as well as monthly debt payments of $20, leaving a monthly net remainder of $115 (Item 8). The SOR alleges $5,320 in delinquent debt, as well as unpaid federal income tax, which Applicant estimates at $5,000 (SOR;",

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the \nguidelines for financial considerations, alcohol consumption, and criminal \nconduct. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant \naccess to classified information. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n 1  \nMay 21, 2009\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \nOn January 4, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required as \npart of his employment with a defense contractor (Item 4). After reviewing the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \nOn November 7, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG). Applicant received the SOR (Item 1) on November 17, 2008 \n(Item 2). He signed his Answer to the SOR (Item 3) on November 25, 2008, in \nwhich he denied allegations 1.l., 2.d., 2.f., 3.a., 3.b., and 3.d.2 He noted that he \nwas \u201cnot aware\u201d of the charges listed at allegation 2.a.(2) and 2.b.(3). I construe \nthese statements as denials of the cited portions of allegations 2.a. and 2.b. \nApplicant also requested an administrative decision without a hearing.  \n \nDOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM)3 \non January 16, 2009, in support of the Government\u2019s preliminary decision. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 29, 2009. He was given 30 days from \nthe date he received the FORM to file a response, but did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on April 23, 2009. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel included in the FORM a Motion to Amend the SOR. \nThe Applicant had notice of the Motion as it was included in the FORM sent to \nhim by Department Counsel. The Motion requests the following changes: \n \n\u2022 Strike allegation 1.a., because it duplicates allegation 1.h.; \n \n\u2022 Strike \u201cJanuary 1998\u201d in allegation 2.d. and insert in its place \u201cJune \n1999\u201d; \n \n\u2022 Strike \u201c1997\u201d in allegation 3.a. and insert in its place \u201c1976.\u201d \n \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Applicant noted a typographical error in the SOR numbering, which does not include an \nallegation labeled 1.c.  \n \n3 See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00a7 E3.1.7. The FORM included nine documents (Items 1-9) proffered \nin support of the Government's case. \n\n \n 3  \n                                                     \n The intent of the requested change is not substantive, but only to correct \ntypographical errors and delete duplications. The Government\u2019s Motion is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nFORM submitted by the Government, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He married in 1988 and divorced in 1990, and \nlisted no children on his January 2008 security clearance application.4 He \nreceived an Associate in Science degree in 1986. Since 1997, he has worked as \na network technician, machine operator, printing press operator, cellular \ntechnician, microwave technician, and in construction. Many of these jobs were \nshort-term. In November 2007, he began working in his current position as an \nelectronics technician, and submitted his security clearance application shortly \nafter. This is his first application for a security clearance (Item 4).  \n \n \nApplicant earns an hourly wage of $15. In his Personal Financial \nStatement (PFS) of July 2008, he lists gross monthly wages of $2,674, which \nequals approximately $32,000 gross annual income. Applicant's wage statement \nfor the two-week period of August 19 \u2013 31, 2008, lists 147 hours, indicating that \nhe works overtime. After deductions, his net monthly income is $1,526. Applicant \nlisted $1,390 in monthly expenses in his PFS, as well as monthly debt payments \nof $20, leaving a monthly net remainder of $115 (Item 8). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges $5,320 in delinquent debt, as well as unpaid federal \nincome tax, which Applicant estimates at $5,000 (SOR; Item 8, page 141). \nApplicant's debts became delinquent between 2002 and 2008 (Items 5 and 6). \nHe admits to 11 of the 12 SOR debts, denying only allegation 1.l., a debt of $732. \nThe February 2008 credit bureau report (Item 6) shows that this debt for \nfamily/child support has been delinquent since 2002. Applicant lists it as a \ngarnishment of $422.50 per month in his Interrogatory response (Item 8, page \n141), but no such garnishment appears on his pay check (Item 8, page 144-145). \nIn his response to DOHA Interrogatories, Applicant supplied proof of payments of \n$10 in September 2008 to the creditors listed at allegations 1.d., and 1.h., and \npayments of $30 on the debt at allegation 1.k. Applicant supplied evidence of \nagreements with the creditors at allegations 1.b. and 1.g., but did not provide \nproof that he has made payments on these payment plans (Item 8). The record \nincludes no evidence of plans or payments made on the remaining debts. \n \n \n4 Applicant apparently owes \u201cchild/family support\u201d (allegation 1.l.; Items 5 and 6), but the record is \nsilent as to the party or parties to whom Applicant owes this obligation.  \n\n \n 4  \n \nApplicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2002 \nand 2006. He did not provide a reason, other than his Interrogatory response, \u201cI \nmeant to file but I just procrastinated. This was my fault, and I have filed for the \nother years, before and after.\u201d (Item 8 at p. 66). He was in touch with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) at the time he submitted his Interrogatory response in \nSeptember 2008, and noted that after he files the returns, the IRS will arrange a \npayment plan (Item 8 at p. 66). \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol at age 21, in 1976. From that time, to \napproximately Spring 2007, he drank two to three times per week, usually eight \nto ten beers each time (Item 8). He has been arrested on charges of Driving \nUnder the Influence of Alcohol in 1977, 1978, 1997, 1999, and 2006. Each of \nthese arrests included additional charges such as driving without a license; \ndriving in violation of license restrictions; driving without proper helmet/eye \nprotection; driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more; transporting an \nopen container; and attempting to elude. The Applicant's Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation arrest record lists each of these arrests and the associated charges \n(Item 7). As a result of his 1997 arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, \nApplicant spent three weeks in jail, and was also sentenced to one year of \nunsupervised probation. After his June 1999 conviction on the same charge, he \nwas sentenced to two years of supervised probation, and required to attend eight \nhours of weekly counseling for four weeks (Item 8 at pp. 58-60). Applicant's June \n2006 conviction was dismissed when he completed a court-ordered alcohol \ntreatment program (Item 8 at p. 63). \n \n \nUpon admission to the treatment program in September 2006, Applicant \nwas evaluated as Alcohol Dependent by a Licensed Alcohol and Drug Abuse \nCounselor (LADAC). Applicant attended individual counseling as well as \nintensive outpatient group counseling. He participated in Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) and had negative results on the periodic urine and breath tests. The goal of \nApplicant's program was to be able to \u201clive a sober life in the community.\u201d \nApplicant was discharged in August 2007 with a diagnosis of Alcohol \nDependence in Early Partial Remission and a positive prognosis (Item 8 at p. \n112). \n \n \nApplicant admitted during his investigative interview in March 2008 that he \ndrove when intoxicated because \u201chis thinking and judgment were clouded by the \nalcohol.\u201d He admitted his alcohol problem. As of the date of the interview, he had \nabstained for the previous six months because he wanted to change his drinking \nbehavior, safeguard his health, and avoid losing money paid in alcohol-related \nfines (Item 8 at p. 60). Subsequently, at some point between March and \nSeptember 2008, when Applicant completed his response to DOHA \nInterrogatories, he resumed drinking alcohol. In his Interrogatory response, \nApplicant stated that he drinks \u201cone to two beers, not more than once per week\u201d \nand has not drunk alcohol to the point of intoxication for more than two years \n(Item 8). \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first engaged in criminal conduct in 1976 when he was \ncharged with Possession of Stolen Property. Applicant pled guilty and was fined. \nIn July 1980, he was charged with Evading Arrest (Item 7). The record does not \ncontain information about the disposition of this charge. More recently, Applicant \nused cocaine seven times between January and May 2001 (Item 8 at pp. 51; 64). \nHe was arrested in June 2001 and charged with Possession/Use of Narcotic \nDrug and with Possession/Use of Drug Paraphernalia (Item 7). The latter charge \nwas dismissed after he received drug treatment starting in December 2001. He \nsuccessfully concluded the program in November 2002 (Item 8 at p. 115). The \nrecord is silent as to details of this treatment. Applicant stated in his Interrogatory \nresponse that he has not used illegal drugs since April 2001 and has no intention \nto use them in the future (Item 8). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-\nsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect \nconsideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred \nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under the guidelines related to financial \nconsiderations, alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest6 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. \nAdditionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.  \n \n \n5 Directive 6.3 \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n 6  \n                                                     \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern pertaining to finances is that \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability \nto protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a \nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including \nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may \nindicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts \n(AG \u00b618). \n \n \nThe facts presented support application of AG \u00b619(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Applicant owes $5,300 in delinquent debts to ten creditors. He has \nallowed delinquencies to accrue for years, and many of Applicant\u2019s debts, which \nstarted becoming delinquent around 2002, still appear in his 2008 credit bureau \nreports. AG \u00b619(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same) also applies because \nApplicant did not file his federal tax returns for Tax Years 2002 and 2006.  \n \n \nThe financial considerations guideline includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. The following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 7  \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies are both numerous and recent. Although some \nbecame delinquent as far back as 2002, all remain unpaid. AG \u00b620(a) does not \napply. The file does not indicate that factors such as unemployment, divorce or \nother unforeseen events interfered with Applicant\u2019s ability to pay his debts. He \ncould have taken steps to initiate payment plans in the years since his debts \nbecame delinquent, as he did in September 2008, after he received the DOHA \nInterrogatories.. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b620(a) and (b) cannot be applied. \n \n \nApplicant submitted evidence that he has contacted several creditors and \nstarted payment plans (allegations 1.b., 1.d., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.k.). Although he \nshowed one payment toward each of three of these debts, he offered no proof of \na track record of payments. He provided no documentation to show that the \nremaining alleged debts have been paid. Without such a track record, or \ndocumentation that Applicant either resolved his debts or made a good-faith \neffort to do so, neither AG 20 \u00b6(c) nor AG \u00b620(d) can be applied. In addition, it is \nof particular concern that Applicant failed to fulfill his obligation to file returns and \npay his federal income tax for two years. He offered no substantive reason for his \nfailure, and his apparent lack of appreciation for this obligation raises concerns. I \nresolve Guideline F against Applicant. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the \nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21). \n \n \nAvailable information raises disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, \n\n \n 8  \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of \nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser \nor alcohol dependent) applies based on Applicant's five arrests for DUI between \n1977 and 2006. His history of excessive alcohol use, as well as the poor \njudgment he displayed by driving after becoming intoxicated, implicate AG \u00b6 \n22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent). Finally, AG \u00b6 22(f) applies (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse \nor dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program). After \nApplicant was evaluated as alcohol dependent in 2006, he completed a \ntreatment program and was discharged in 2007 with an evaluation of alcohol \ndependence in early partial remission. He later told the security investigator that \nhe wanted to change his behavior, and knew that alcohol was costing him large \nsums of money and endangering his health. He abstained for six months. \nNevertheless, he subsequently returned to drinking alcohol. \n \n \nAs to mitigation, AG \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior \nwas so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nproblems are not in the distant past. His alcohol use cannot be considered \ninfrequent or unusual behavior, given his extensive history. Despite this history, \nhis alcohol treatment, and his acknowledgement of the negative effects on his \nlife, Applicant's decision to return to the use of alcohol casts serious doubt on his \ncurrent good judgment.  \n \nSome mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual \nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides \nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence [if alcohol dependent] or responsible use [if an alcohol \nabuser]). At his security interview in 2008, Applicant admitted that he has an \nalcohol problem. He has attended alcohol treatment, and he did abstain from \nalcohol for six months in 2007-2008. However, AG \u00b6 23(b) requires that Applicant \nestablish a pattern of abstinence. Applicant has not established such a pattern, \nas he had resumed drinking alcohol. The facts do not support application of AG \u00b6 \n23(b). I find against Applicant on Guideline G. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is that \n \nCriminal conduct creates doubt about a person=s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person=s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d \n(AG \u00b630).  \n \n\n \n 9  \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple \nlesser offenses) applies. Since 1976, Applicant\u2019s criminal history includes \ncharges of possession of stolen property, possession/use of an illegal drug, and \nfive convictions for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Deciding to drive after \nbecoming intoxicated is a serious offense; each time he did so he not only \ndisplayed poor judgment, but also represented a threat to public safety and to \nhimself. As a result of his repeated convictions, he has been fined, had his \ndriving license suspended and restricted, been placed on probation, and been \nreferred for alcohol treatment. AG \u00b6 31(a) applies. \n \nGuideline J includes two relevant mitigating conditions: AG \u00b6 32(a) (so \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and AG \u00b6 \n32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, \njob training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement).  \n \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG \u00b6 32(d) mitigate Applicant's conduct. Several of \nthe offenses alleged against Applicant, which involve criminal conduct that \noccurred approximately 30 years ago (allegations 1.a., 1.b., 3.a. and 3.b.), are \nmitigated by the passage of time. However, application of AG \u00b6 32(a) also \nrequires that all the conduct not cast doubt on an Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and \ngood judgment. When this old conduct is viewed along with his more recent \ncriminal conduct, a pattern emerges that demonstrates a willingness to disregard \nthe law. This pattern does demonstrate a lack of reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) cannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d) applies partially, because Applicant has demonstrated \nrehabilitation by avoiding illegal drugs since 2001. However, he admits that he \nhas resumed drinking alcohol. His persistence in engaging in conduct that has \nresulted in repeated criminal convictions over a period of three decades \nundermines any claim to rehabilitation as to his alcohol-related criminal conduct, \nand AG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. I find against Applicant on Guideline J. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and \nhave applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have \nalso reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n                                                     \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct that includes arrests and \nconvictions that started in 1976, more than 30 years ago. He has engaged in \ncriminal conduct as a mature adult, including using cocaine when he was 46 \nyears old, and being convicted on a DUI charge when he was 51. Such conduct \nin middle age raises serious questions about his good judgment and reliability. \nAlthough Applicant recognizes the negative effects alcohol has had on his life, he \ncontinues to drink alcohol.  \n \n \nApplicant's last alcohol-related arrest and conviction occurred about three \nyears ago. After his resulting alcohol treatment, he briefly abstained from alcohol. \nDespite the fact that Applicant was evaluated as alcohol dependent by a licensed \nalcohol and drug abuse counselor,9 he returned to drinking alcohol and will \ncontinue to use it in the future. He cannot claim rehabilitation because he \ncontinues to engage in the conduct that led to most of his criminal conduct\u2014\ndrinking alcohol. In addition, Applicant has disregarded his financial obligations, \nand most importantly, failed to meet his obligation to file returns and pay federal \nincome taxes. A fair and common-sense assessment of the available information \nbearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows he has not \nsatisfied the doubts about his ability and willingness to protect the Government\u2019s \ninterests. Accordingly, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by \nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a  \n \n \nDismissed by Government \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.  \n \n \nOmitted from SOR \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d. \u2013 1.n.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n9 The counselor\u2019s credentials as an LADAC do not meet disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(e) under \nGuideline G. However, the requirements for this credential are substantial, and I conclude that \nthe evaluation is appropriate to consider within the whole person analysis. \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. \u2013 2.h.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n. \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a. \u2013 3.d.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to allow Applicant access to classified information.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \nApplicant signed and submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on May \n30, 2007. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, \nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to \nAugust 26, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn February 24, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on March 31, 2009, \nApplicant admitted with explanation all five allegations. He also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 29, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 7, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 27, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered four exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted. Applicant testified, did not offer \nexhibits, and presented the testimony of four witnesses. I held the record open to allow \nApplicant to submit documents. Applicant timely submitted nine documents. Department \nCounsel forwarded the documents, without objection, and I admitted them into the \nrecord as AE A through I.3 DOHA received the transcript on June 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement \nof Reasons, and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 60 years old, holds an associate\u2019s degree in applied science and \ngeneral education. He married in 1973, divorced in 2001, and has a 29-year-old son \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006.  \n \n3 Applicant's post-hearing submission contained nine items marked numerically. To avoid confusion with \nthe government\u2019s exhibits, I will identify the items as follows: AE A-Applicant's plan to pay debts; AE B \nand C-pay stubs for two weeks in December 2008 and two weeks in May 2009, respectively; AE D-\nDecember 2007 letter re Department of Veterans Affairs benefit increase; AE E-1099-R forms for 2008 \nretirement pay; AE F-Applicant's resume; AE G-receipts for bills paid in December 2008; AE H-list of \nchecks paid June 2008 \u2013 June 2009; AE I-June 2009 letter re rental lease. \n\n \n \n3\n                                                \nwho does not live with him. He is currently in a long-term relationship with a woman, but \nshe does not contribute financially (GE 1; Tr. 27, 29-30, 74-75).  \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from 1973 to 1993 and reached the rank of \nChief Warrant Officer (CW3). He held a security clearance during his service. He was \nemployed as an information technology technician from 1995 to July 2000. At that point, \nApplicant started his own computer-services business in Puerto Rico. After September \n11, 2001, the Puerto Rican economy suffered, as did Applicant's business. He lost \napproximately $80,000 during the years he operated this business. He used credit cards \nand his pension account funds to pay his bills. After approximately three years, he \nclosed the business4 and returned to the United States with about $30,000 to $35,000 \nin debt. He held a series of short-term jobs between 2004 and 2007, most lasting one to \nfour months. He had two periods of unemployment: one month in 2004, and a total of \nsix months in 2005. Applicant testified that although he is highly employable, he is \nusually offered low salaries. At one point, he received unemployment compensation, \njust before he began his current position in November 2007 (GE 1, 2; AE F; Tr. 18-20, \n27-28, 42-44). \n \nDuring his periods of short-term employment and unemployment, Applicant was \nunable to earn enough money to pay his debts. He applied for personal loans several \ntimes so that he could consolidate the debts, but was rejected. He was unable to pay \nthe amounts offered by creditors to settle some debts. He has been making payments \non one bank credit card that is not alleged in the SOR, and he has paid the balance on \nanother debt. However, as his delinquencies continued, the interest rates and balances \nowed increased. Applicant testified that some of the SOR debts are charged off on his \ncredit bureau report. He is uncertain whether or not he still owes these debts (GE 3, 4; \nAE G, H; Tr. 21-22). He testified,  \n \n\u2026Now, to me, charge-off means that it\u2019s cleared, okay, that they\u2019ll \ntake the loss on it for business purposes and write it off. \n \nThey don\u2019t -- they have never said that the payment had to be \nmade again, so here the card shows as charged off.  Like [credit card \ncompany 1] and [credit card company 2], they were charged off as \nbad debt, so does that constitute a debt to me still?  \n  \n \nI mean, if possible, I\u2019ll pay them off, but it\u2019s not going to be right \naway (Tr. 21). \n \n \n4 The evidence indicates a discrepancy in the dates Applicant was self-employed. GE 1 and GE 2 \nindicate he closed the business in 2004. However, Applicant's resume (AE F) shows he was employed \nat a business with the same name until November 2006. \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \nApplicant also believes that if he waits one year, he will be able to arrange \nsettlement agreements with the creditors, or the companies might charge off the debts: \n \nI\u2019ve used those time limits in order to try and get the lowest possible \npayback that I have to return, but in order to do that, I have to have the \nmoney available to me, and that is my problem.  \n \nOnly last month am I being able to start accumulating a little bit of extra \nmoney so I can go to these credit companies.  On a $10,000, they\u2019ll \nprobably ask for $2,000, okay, or 70 percent I think they take off of the \ndebt, and if I have to pay just 30 percent of the debt, I can clear that out, \nand that\u2019s to my advantage, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do (Tr. 81). \n \nApplicant believes that the interest rates charged by the creditors are exorbitant, and if \nhe can pay a lower amount, which is closer to what he actually owes, then he will try to \npay that lower amount (Tr. 80-84).5 \n \nIn 2005, Applicant used a consumer counseling agency, but was required to pay \nthe agency more than it paid on his debts, so he ended the program after about one \nmonth. He considered filing for bankruptcy, and completed the online financial \nmanagement classes that are required by those filing a petition. About one year ago, he \nretained an attorney but \u201cdecided not to fill [sic] bankruptcy because of my pride.\u201d In \naddition, he learned that he is \u201cin the gray area of qualifying for bankruptcy due to the \nnew laws.\u201d He plans to continue to consult with the attorney (GE 2; Tr. 75-79). \n \nApplicant\u2019s starting salary in 2007 was $80,000, and after subsequent increases, \nhe now earns an annual gross income of $86,000. His net income is approximately \n$50,000, or $4,000 net monthly. Applicant's additional income includes monthly \npayments of $1,647 in retirement income, which amounted to $25,000 in 2008, and \nabout $120 per month in veteran\u2019s benefits. When all three sources are taken together, \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income is approximately $5,767. He pays approximately $4,000 in \nmonthly expenses, and $1,417 in debt payments, leaving a monthly net remainder of \napproximately $350 (GE 2, 3; AE B, C, D, E; Tr. 55-58). \n \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges five debts, totaling approximately $55,200. \nThe delinquent accounts include four credit cards with balances of $14,545; $13,767; \n$7,056; and $17,566, as well as one unsecured loan with a balance of $2,346. These \ndebts became delinquent between February 2006 and September 2007. In his Personal \nFinancial Statement (PFS), Applicant listed a monthly payment on one of the SOR \n \n5 Applicant Exhibit A includes explanations of the terms \u201cdebt settlement,\u201d and \u201ccharge off.\u201d The source \nof this information is unclear. As I cannot determine its reliability, I will not rely on it in reaching my \nconclusions. The exhibit also includes Applicant's plan to address his debts, and I will consider this \ninformation (AE A).  \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \ndebts (allegation 1.e.). However, in his action plan, he listed a higher unpaid balance for \nthis debt than is shown in the SOR, and also noted that he would start paying it off in \nSeptember 2009. Therefore, it is unclear from the evidence whether he has, in fact, \nbeen paying the monthly payment on this debt that he listed in his PFS. He did not list \nany payments on the other four SOR debts. Applicant testified that only within the \nmonth before the hearing did he become financially capable of paying his delinquent \ndebts at a faster rate (GE 2, 3, 4; AE A; Tr. 22). \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant submitted a document titled, \u201cPlan of Objectives \nand Actions to Repay Debt.\u201d The plan includes five debts listed in the SOR, and one \ndebt not alleged in the SOR. Starting in August 2009, Applicant plans to save funds for \napproximately four months, contact one creditor, obtain a settlement for 70 percent of \nthe balance owed, and pay the settlement. Using this plan, Applicant hopes to pay the \nfive SOR debts sequentially by April 2011 (AE A). \n \nApplicant's four witnesses have all known him approximately 1.5 years. His \ncurrent supervisor and company operations officer is aware of Applicant's financial \nproblems, and testified that his character is above reproach. The three co-workers who \ntestified are also aware that Applicant has financial problems stemming from his \nbusiness venture. They testified that he is a team player who has a serious attitude \nabout his work, and has shown honesty and integrity in his performance. One co-\nworker, who holds a high-level clearance, testified that Applicant's long military service, \nduring which he held a security clearance, shows that he can be trusted with classified \nmaterial (Tr. 90-122). \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition under a \nGuideline does not determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant.  However, \nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access \nto classified information.  In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by \nthe parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors \naddressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \n \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest7 to grant an applicant access to \nclassified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible \ninformation on which it based the preliminary decision to deny a security clearance. The \ngovernment must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the \ngovernment meets its burden, it falls to an applicant to refute or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant \nbears a heavy burden.8 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust. Therefore, the government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or her own. The \n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of reasonable \ndoubts about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe facts presented support application of AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant owes approximately $55,000 in delinquent debt that started accruing in 2006. \nThese debts remained unpaid as of the date of the hearing, indicating that both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7\n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes factors that can mitigate \ndisqualifying conditions. The following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are numerous, amounting to approximately $55,000, and they \nare recent, as they currently remain unpaid. They did occur under circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur \u2013 a failed attempt to operate his own business \u2013 and it is unlikely \nthat he will initiate such a venture again. However, Applicant has not tried to resolve \nthese debts over the past year and a half, since he obtained steady employment. His \ninaction casts doubt on his good judgment in relation to his financial obligations. AG \n\u00b620(a) does not apply.   \n \nThe key element in mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) is that the factors that caused \nthe financial problems were beyond an applicant\u2019s control. Applicant's delinquencies \nstemmed from several years of trying to operate a failing business, his use of credit \ncards to pay his bills during that period, and his inability to pay these debts because of \nsubsequent short-term, generally low-paying jobs. The after-effects of September 11 \ncontributed to the failure of Applicant's business, which was beyond Applicant's control. \nHowever, over the past approximately one-and-one-half years, Applicant has been \nemployed full-time, with a good income from his employment, his military pension, and \nveteran\u2019s benefit. Despite having a monthly remainder of more than $300, Applicant \nhas made little effort to deal with his significant debt during this time. Without evidence \nof efforts that Applicant attempted to resolve his financial situation, I conclude that he \nhas not acted responsibly, and this mitigating condition cannot be applied.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) relate to efforts to resolve debts. Applicant has not sought \nfinancial counseling. He considered bankruptcy, and retained an attorney, but has not \nfollowed through on that plan. He initiated contact with a debt consolidation company, \nbut also decided not to use that method. There is no evidence that Applicant has paid \nany of the five SOR debts or made consistent payments on any of them. Applicant's \n\n \n \n8\nplan to pay the debts in the future is simply a promise. A promise of future payment, \nwithout documentation to substantiate a track record of consistent payments, does not \nconstitute a good-faith effort to pay debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d) do not apply. Overall, \nApplicant remains substantially indebted, and has not taken documented steps to \nresolve his financial obligations. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nAt the time his debts started to become delinquent in 2006, Applicant was a \nmature and experienced adult approximately 57 years of age. He has done little since \nobtaining steady work to resolve his indebtedness, despite earning an income that \nwould have allowed him to make some effort toward setting up payment plans and \ninitiating payments. Finally, his plan to pay his delinquencies in the future does not \nconstitute a track record of documented effort to resolve his debts. Overall, the record \nevidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.e. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n \n9\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

On January 29, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E concerning the Applicant. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on February 12, 2009, and requested\na decision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) to the Applicant on March 11, 2009. The Applicant received the FORM on\nMarch 24, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. The\nApplicant elected not to submit any additional information. The case was assigned to\n\n2\nme on May 15, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 53 and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges under the Financial Considerations adjudication\nguideline that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admitted allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f. of the SOR.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe FORM contained credit bureau reports dated July 18, 2007  (Item 5); June\n19, 2008 (Item 6); and January 11, 2009 (Item 7). Those reports show that the Applicant\nowed the debts set forth in the SOR. The Applicant submits that he was laid off in 2004\nfrom his long-time employment and found his hourly salary dropped from $24.52 per\nhour to $9.52 per hour. He currently makes $12.50 an hour.  (Item 3 at 1.)\n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a credit union for a judgment in\nthe amount of $22,000.00. He submitted a letter from the law firm for the credit union\nshowing that, in November 2008, he had come to a payment arrangement for the\njudgment. That arrangement requires the Applicant to pay $125.00 per month beginning\nin December 2008 until he has paid off the debt.  This payment is withdrawn\nautomatically from his checking account.  (Item 3.)  This subparagraph is found for the\nApplicant.\n1.b.  The Applicant admits owing a past due debt in the amount of $5,148.00.\nThere is no evidence that the Applicant has taken any steps to resolve or pay this debt.\n1.c.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a credit card company in the\namount of $37,750.00. There is no evidence that the Applicant has taken any steps to\nresolve or pay this debt.\n1.d.  The Applicant denies owing a debt to an automobile leasing company in the\namount of $18,966.00. He states that this is the same debt as the judgment set forth in\nsubparagraph 1.a., above. Based on my review of the evidence, I find this argument\ncredible and worthy of belief.  This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.\n1.e.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to an apartment complex in the\namount of $2,710.00. This debt occurred because the Applicant was laid off and could\n\n3\nno longer afford his apartment. He currently lives with his mother.  There is no evidence\nthat the Applicant has taken any steps to resolve or pay this debt.\n1.f.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a second credit card company in\nthe amount of $8,800.00. There is no evidence that the Applicant has taken any steps to\nresolve or pay this debt.\n1.g.  The Applicant denies that he is indebted for a medical bill in the amount of\n$269.00. He states in his Answer that this debt has been paid in full (Item 3 at 2.) This\ndebt appears on the oldest credit bureau report in the record, which dates from 2007\n(Item 5). However, it does not appear in the most recent reports that date from 2008\nand 2009 (Items 6 and 7). The debt also does not appear on an August 6, 2008, credit\nreport provided by the Applicant. (Item 8 at 12-29.) This subparagraph is found for the\nApplicant.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nThe Government alleges under the Personal Conduct adjudicative guideline that\nthe Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct which\nshows questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations. \n2.a.  The Applicant filled out his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) on June 19, 2007 (Item 4). Question 28.a. of Item 4 asks the\nApplicant whether, within the last seven years, he had been more than 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts. In addition, Question 28.b. asks the Applicant whether, as of\nthat date, he was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debt. He stated, \u201cNo\u201d\nin response to both questions. He did not set forth any of the numerous delinquent\ndebts described under Paragraph 1, above.  This answer was, therefore, false.  \nThe Applicant denied this allegation and stated, \u201cI told the investigator about all\nof my debts.  I completed the questionnaire on-line, and did not intentionally make false\nstatements. I misunderstood the questions on the on-line questionnaire.\u201d (Item 3 at 2.)\nThe Applicant had an interview with a Government investigator on November 15, 2007,\nand fully discussed his debt situation. (Item 8 at 6-8.) I have considered all of the\navailable evidence and find that it does adequately explain the Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nSpecifically, under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant did\nnot falsify his questionnaire.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n4\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own common\nsense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The evidence shows that the Applicant has at least $45,608.00 in\npast due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. This figure\nexcludes the amounts in allegations 1.a., 1.d. and 1.g., which I have found for the\nApplicant. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(b)\nstates that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d The\nApplicant argues that most of these debts came from unemployment or\nunderemployment after 2004. However, the Applicant has not made any attempts to pay\nor otherwise resolve his debts until very recently. He evidently does not have any\norganized program to pay these debts. I cannot find, under these particular facts, that\nthe Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. In addition, the Applicant\nstates on page 1 of his Answer (Item 3), \u201cI admit that I have made some serious\nmistakes with my finances.\u201d  Without more, I cannot find that he will use good judgment\nregarding his debts in the future.\nAG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthere are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  His past due indebtedness appears\nto all predate 2005. He is slowly paying his past due indebtedness.  This mitigating\ncondition is arguably applicable.\n\n6\nThe Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off two of his creditors.\nHowever, he continues to have excessive debts, in the amount of $45,608.00 that he\nhas no current plans to pay.  AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.\nI have weighed the Applicant\u2019s conduct in paying some of his accounts in the\npast year. In addition, I have looked at the circumstances in which he allowed this\nconduct to occur, particularly that he was laid off. While he is paying his debts off, and is\nto be commended for that, I find that it is still too soon, given the other circumstances of\nthis case, to find that this conduct may not recur in the future. Paragraph 1 is found\nagainst the Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) states that it may be disqualifying where an Applicant engages in the\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d  \nThe Applicant\u2019s Questionnaire contains false answers about his financial\nsituation. I have considered his written statement, wherein he states that he would not\nfalsify a questionnaire about his debts, and that he misread the questions in the on-line\nquestionnaire. He also showed that, several months later, he discussed his debt\nsituation in detail with a Government investigator.  Based on the facts of this case, the\nApplicant has met his burden to show that the act was a benign error and not an\nintentional falsehood. AG \u00b6 17(a) \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts\u201d; and \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment\u201d also apply to this case.\nBased on the record, I find the Applicant did not intentionally falsify his answers\nas set forth in subparagraph 2.a. Based on all of the information set forth above,\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), all of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct, financial, and personal, is frequent and relatively recent.  Based on\nthe state of the record, I cannot find that there have been permanent behavioral\nchanges under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the present time, I cannot find that there is\nlittle to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), or that\nthe likelihood of recurrence is close to nil (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\nFinancial Considerations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.

See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nIn this case, Applicant elected to have a decision based upon the written record.

I did not know that information had to be supplied for his decision.\nNo one told me that I had to have character letters or documentation of bills.\u201d   A review of the\n3\nrecord indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order\n10865 and the Directive, including an opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM).

See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to\nprotect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd.

Delaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on June 29, 2006.\nOn November 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations\n(Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on December 8, 2008, and requested\na decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File\nof Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on January 9, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nJanuary 22, 2009. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM within the 30-day time\nApril 6, 2009\n\n2\nperiod. On March 24, 2009, Department Counsel indicated he had no objection to the\ninformation provided by Applicant. The case file was assigned to me on March 27,\n2009. \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn January 9, 2009, the Government moved to amend the SOR by adding\nanother subparagraph to Guideline F. The proposed amendment reads, \u201c1.j. You are\nindebted to Citi Financial in the approximate amount of $8,441 on a judgment filed on or\nabout April 2007. As of October 16, 2008, this debt had not been paid.\u201d In Section V of\nthe FORM, the government requested Applicant respond to the proposed amendment\nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM did not\ninclude a reply to the amendment. Items 6, 7, and 8 support this amendment. Pursuant\nto E3.1.17. of the Directive, allowing changes to be made in the SOR so that it conforms\nto the evidence presented, the Government\u2019s Motion is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is divorced with three children. His 17-year-old child lives with his\nformer wife. He has been employed as a systems administrator with his current\nemployer since March 1998. His military background includes 15 years in the United\nStates Army where he received an Honorable Discharge in April 1998. He seeks a\nsecurity clearance. \nThe SOR contains 10 allegations under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant admitted all allegations listed under SOR 1.a. through SOR 1.i. The credit\nbureau report (CBR, Item 7) in SOR 1.j. proves that a judgment of $8,441 was filed\nagainst Applicant in April 2007. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the\nfollowing factual findings. \nApplicant owes 10 creditors on overdue accounts totaling approximately $42,000.\nThe accounts include credit cards, medical accounts and one judgment. \n! SOR 1.a., $705. Applicant made a payment of $234.46 on August 29, 2008\n(Item 6). Applicant avers he paid the debt completely in January 2009, but was unable\nto produce documentation. Applicant still owes the account. \n! SOR 1.b., $396. Applicant claims the creditors in SOR 1.b. and 1.i. ($635)\ndescribe the same creditor for different accounts. A representative of the collection\nagency agreed to accept a settlement of $200 to pay both accounts. No supporting\ndocumentation showing payment of the settlement has been produced. \n! SOR 1.c., $8,162. This account was opened in May 2000, and became\ndelinquent in October 2007. Applicant indicated (with documentation) he paid $709 on\nMarch 2 and March 4, 2009. However, he provided no documentation of paying $390 on\nMarch 15, 2009, which he claimed he did \u201cto catch them back up (response to FORM).\u201d\n\n3\nFurthermore, there is no indication from the creditor that Applicant\u2019s payments restored\nthe account to good standing. \n! SOR 1.d., $5,216. The final activity on this account was in June 2006.\nApplicant says that he has been paying $300 every month to a collection firm since\nNovember 2008. Even though Applicant stated the collection firm did not provide\ninformation about payments, Applicant could have provided the same type of\ndocumentary proof he provided in response to SOR 1.c., with internet printouts of his\nchecking account. He still owes this account. \n! SOR 1.e., $1,929. Applicant claimed he had paid them $800. No\ndocumentation was provided to support his claim of payments. Applicant is still\nresponsible for this account. \n!SOR 1.f., $1,295. Applicant claimed in his response to the FORM he paid $647\nto the collection agency to pay the account off. The documentation in the attachment\nshows he paid $647.75 in settlement of the delinquent account. This allegation is\nresolved in his favor. \n \n! SOR 1.g., $15,286. The last activity on the account was in November 2005.\nApplicant indicates that he has not found the current holder of the account. SOR 1.g. is\nresolved against Applicant. \n! SOR 1.h., $931. Applicant claimed he paid this delinquent account but had not\nreceived the receipt. As he had done with SOR 1.c., Applicant could have provided\ndocumentation from his bank account or internet that the debt was paid. Applicant is still\nresponsible for the account. \n! SOR 1.i., $635. Applicant states he received an offer of settlement of $200 to\npay this debt and the account in SOR 1.b. Applicant has not provided verification that he\npaid the settlement. \n!SOR 1.j., $8,441. A judgment was filed against Applicant in April 2007. This\njudgment is resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his financial problems is attached to his responses to\ninterrogatories he furnished on September 15, 2008 (Item 6). He stated that his\ndaughter got married when neither she nor her husband had a job. Applicant did not\nindicate when his daughter had these personal problems. Applicant\u2019s former wife was\nsupposed to pay for half the wedding, and because she did not, he had to pay an extra\n$8,000. He also found out his daughter was pregnant, and he and her mother-in-law\nhad to pay for her diagnostic, pregnancy exams because she had no insurance.\nApplicant\u2019s daughter had the baby. Then, her husband entered the United States Army.\nHe decided he wanted a divorce a year later.\n\n4\nIt cost Applicant $1,500 for an attorney to represent his daughter in the divorce.\nThe daughter\u2019s husband came home for the court action. For some unknown reason,\nthe daughter\u2019s husband changed his mind about the divorce, and returned to his\noverseas duty location. \nWhile overseas, the husband stopped the allotment he had established for\nApplicant\u2019s daughter and their child. Applicant stated that it took an extended amount of\ntime to get the allotment reinstated through the command. \nApplicant noted his daughter and his son are currently working, and taking care\nof some of the bills. Applicant noted he was getting caught up by paying off some of the\nbills. He provided documentation in Item 6 that he was indebted to an unlisted collection\nagency for a computer company, and to a collection firm that had offered him a $208\nsettlement on an original $1,402 delinquent account. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no character evidence such as statements about his job\nperformance or about his lifestyle away from the job. He provided no evidence of\nfinancial counseling. \nIn Item 6, Applicant claimed he is paying the creditor in SOR 1.i. $50 a month\nuntil the account is paid. However,  he provided no documentation. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d \nThe Government\u2019s case has been established under FC disqualifying condition\n(DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19.c. (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant owes approximately $42,000 in debt, and is\nunable to repay. The CBRs (Items 7 and 8) show the debts became delinquent between\nNovember 2005 and October 2007. \nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the\ncircumstances. They are: FC MC 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment);\nFC MC 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control, and the individual acted reasonably under the circumstances); FC\nMC 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is resolved or under control); and, FC MC\n20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay creditors or otherwise resolve\n\n6\ndebts). FC MC 20.a. does not apply. Although two of the debts fell delinquent in 2005\nseven of the past due accounts and one judgment are less than four years old. Though I\nacknowledge his payoff of one creditor in February 2009 and other partial payments to a\nfew of the other listed creditors, he still owes about $40,300 to nine creditors. His\nfinancial situation continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\njudgment. \nApplicant receives mitigation under FC MC 20.b. for the unexpected decision of\nhis former wife not to pay for half his daughter\u2019s wedding, and leaving him with a\nwedding bill of about $8,000. Applicant receives credit for supporting his daughter,\nhusband, and their child for varying periods of time when his daughter and husband\nwere not working. Applicant is entitled to additional mitigation for having to provide food\nand shelter for his daughter when her husband was on an overseas assignment.\nApplicant receives some mitigation for paying for his daughter\u2019s legal expenses of about\n$1,500 for a divorce that did not occur. Finally, Applicant should receive additional credit\nfor providing food and shelter to his daughter and her child during the time he was trying\nto get the allotment reinstated. \nFC MC 20.c. does not apply as there is no evidence Applicant has ever\nparticipated in financial counseling. Applicant is still more than $40,000 in debt, so\nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness cannot be considered under control. \nFC MC 20.d. (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) has only limited application. It is clear Applicant has made\n$1,635 in documented payments to the listed creditors. Using SOR 1.b. as an example,\nApplicant demonstrated with the assistance of internet-generated documents that he\nmade payments to the creditor. However, Applicant failed to explain why he did not\nemploy the same methodology to prove he had paid the other creditors. Applicant\u2019s\ninability to provide the necessary documentation to substantiate his payment claims\nnegatively affects the believability of those claims. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence under\nFC C 20.b. and 20.d. is not enough to overcome the adverse evidence under FC DC\n19.a. and 19.c.\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine\ngeneral policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nthe participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\n\n7\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant was in the service for 15 years before starting his current job in March\n1998. Based on the credit bureau reports revealing when the listed debts became\ndelinquent, some time between November 2005 and October 2007, Applicant paid for\nan entire wedding costing about $8,000. He paid $1,500 in legal expenses for a divorce.\nAlso, he paid shelter and food expenses for his daughter and her child for an extended\nperiod of time. However, for the same reasons Applicant supported his payment claims\nto some of the debts he paid on or off, he had an obligation to provide documentation\nshowing that he shouldered the costs connected with his daughter\u2019s marital and support\nissues. His inability to produce any documentation for the wedding, legal expenses, and\nfollow-up support he provided for his daughter and child, raise lingering concerns over\nthe reasonableness of his actions in addressing his accumulating debt. In addition,\ngiven a lack documentation for debts he claims he paid, combined with the failure to\nprovide character evidence relating to his job performance and lifestyle, and the\nabsence of financial counseling, Applicant has failed to demonstrate he qualifies for a\nsecurity clearance under the FC guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant\nsubmitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on October 6, 2008,\nadmitted all SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  \nThe case was assigned to me on October 23, 2008. A notice of hearing was issued\non October 28, 2008, scheduling the hearing for November 17, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government submitted four documentary exhibits that were\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 12, 2009\n\n2\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4 and admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified and submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without objection. The record\nwas held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in\nsupport of his case. One document was timely received, marked as AE 4 and admitted into\nthe record without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s forwarding memorandum was marked\nas Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and is included in the file. The transcript was received on\nDecember 1, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old high school graduate who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor as a transportation freight specialist since December 2007. He was\nemployed in private industry as a machine operator from July 1983 until March 2007 when\nhe lost his job due to the company downsizing. Applicant relocated to a different state from\nApril until August  2007 in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a new career. He returned\nto his original state of residence in September 2007 where he was unable to find\nemployment until he was hired by the defense contractor in December 2007. \nApplicant was first married in 1987. That marriage ended in divorce in 1992. He\ndoes not have any children from that marriage. He has been remarried since February\n1993. His wife had two daughters when they married who are now 34 and 25 years old.\nApplicant adopted the younger daughter who is now working as a nurse. She lives with\nApplicant and his wife and assists them in paying some family living expenses.  \nApplicant\u2019s employer from 1983 to 2007 was in the business of manufacturing\nautomobile parts for a major U.S. automobile manufacturer. Economic conditions caused\nthe employer to start significantly downsizing in or about 2004. Applicant\u2019s wife, who\nworked for the same employer for almost 18 years, was earning about $30,000 a year\nwhen she had to leave her job in 2005. Applicant worked a significant amount of overtime\nbefore the downsizing began and was earning $70,000 or more a year up until that time.\nApplicant and his wife were living within their financial means when the employer\u2019s\ndownsizing began. However, they were not accumulating any savings. Realizing their jobs\nwere in jeopardy, they sold the house they owned which was valued at approximately\n$190,000 and moved into a house owned by one of Applicant\u2019s relatives. Still, once his wife\nlost her job and the amount of overtime he was able to work was reduced and/or eliminated\nthey were unable to remain current on their debts. \nApplicant testified he was current on his debts up to the time when he and his wife\nlost their jobs, although he \u201cwas just keeping my head above water.\u201d (Tr. p. 44) A review\nof his February 12, 2008 credit report (GE 3) discloses the method of payment for the\nnumerous accounts listed is \u201cAs Agreed\u201d until the middle of 2006. Thereafter, they started\nto be submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts.    \n\n The account listed in subparagraph 1.m was erroneously listed in the SOR and is not included in\n2\nthese figures. (Tr. pp. 67-70) \n This figure includes $15,000 in severance pay Applicant received from his long-term employment.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n3\nThe SOR lists 12 accounts, totaling $35,067, that have been submitted for collection\nand two accounts, totaling $2,310, that have been charged off as bad debts.  Two of the\n2\ncollection accounts, totaling $5,511, represent the balances owed on leased automobiles\nApplicant returned to dealers in a further effort to reduce his expenses when he and his\nwife lost their employment. The remaining accounts are household expenses and revolving\ncharge accounts. \nApplicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection on September 17, 2008. The\npetition (GE 4) discloses Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s income was $21,666.02 in 2006, $ 12,610.73\nin 2007, and $500.16 as of the date of filing in 2008. Applicant\u2019s income was $41,070.98\nin 2006, $58,816.27  in 2007, and $22,004.23 as of the date of filing in 2008. The petition\n3\nalso discloses that Applicant and his wife\u2019s combined average monthly income, as of the\ndate of filing, was $3,017.09. Applicant\u2019s attorney anticipates a discharge under Chapter\n7 of the bankruptcy code will be awarded to Applicant and his wife in January 2009. (AE\n4)\nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this\ncase. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id. at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n4\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .\n(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports disclose 14 accounts, totalling over $37,000, that have\neither been submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts in the past few years.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC\n19C(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nApplicant was living within his financial means until both he and his wife lost income\nand eventually their long-term employment due to their employer being forced to\nsignificantly downsize. Their combined income fell from what he estimates was in excess\nof $100,000 several years ago to approximately $36,000 annually at present. In between,\nhe experienced at least two months of unemployment and greatly increased living\nexpenses as he attempted to find a new career in a different state. Applicant took\nsignificant steps to reduce his expenditures when he foresaw his family\u2019s loss of income\nand employment and he immediately sought new employment when he actually lost his\njob. Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . . . ), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances applies.\n\n5\nApplicant once again has permanent employment. However, he is earning much\nless than he did when he accumulated the delinquent debt alleged in the SOR. Having no\nother recourse, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in September 2008, and his\nattorney anticipates he will be awarded a Chapter 7 discharge in January 2009. MC 20(d):\nthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts applies.   \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, including Applicant\u2019s appearance and demeanor while testifying,\nhis long-term employment history, the drastic steps he took in an effort to minimize the\nimpact the loss of income and eventually his job would have on he and his family, his\nprevious lengthy history of financial stability, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of\nthe Directive, and the mitigating conditions that apply, I find Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern. He has overcome the case against him and\nsatisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-o:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 23, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 14, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process\ninsofar as he represented himself.  Finding no error, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, mostly for credit card\naccounts.   Acknowledging that these debts may have been affected by Applicant\u2019s former wife\u2019s\n1\nproblems with drugs, the Judge nevertheless concluded that Applicant had not mitigated the security\nconcerns which his financial problems raised.  \u201c[Applicant] acted irresponsibly . . . in not handling\nthe past due debts in a prudent manner.  His enrollment in [a] debt plan in early March 2009, and his\npayment of four small debts . . . four days after the hearing do not provide me with sufficient\nconfidence to believe he is truly committed to paying the remaining debts.\u201d  Decision at 8-9.    \nApplicant offers new evidence in the form of a contention that, at some point prior to the\nhearing, Department Counsel made statements which could be construed as advice that he need not\nhire an attorney to represent him.  He states that he relied upon this purported advice in electing to\nconduct his case pro se and that he was overwhelmed at the hearing.  The Board cannot consider new\nevidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Nonetheless, the Board has considered Applicant\u2019s\nargument, but only for the limited purpose of addressing Applicant\u2019s due process claim.  The record\ndemonstrates that, prior to the hearing, he received written guidance from the Chief Administrative\nJudge that he had the right to employ counsel, or to have some other person represent him at the\nhearing; that he had the right to present evidence and witnesses; that he had the right to cross-\nexamine witnesses against him; and that he had the right to object to evidence.  At the beginning of\nthe hearing, the Judge further advised him of his right to employ counsel.  Applicant stated that he\nhad given thought to doing so but had decided to represent himself.  Tr. at 4.  During the hearing,\nApplicant presented documentary evidence, called three witnesses, and testified in his own behalf.\nHe points to nothing in the record which he likely would have done differently had he been\nrepresented by counsel, or anything likely to have produced a different result.  Under the facts of this\n\n3\ncase, there is no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the due process afforded by the\nDirective.  See  ISCR Case No. 08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on December 20,\n2007. On January 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nMay 14, 2009\n\n W ithout SOR 1.i., the total past due amount is $32,415 SOR 1.i. is also included because the last activity\n1\non this debt (GE 3) is August 2003, about five months before Applicant began his overseas job. After adding\nSOR 1.i., the total is $47,170.\n2\nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 20, 2009. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on March 6, 2009 for a hearing on March 25, 2009. At the hearing,\nfour exhibits (GE I through 4) were admitted in evidence without objection to support the\ngovernment's case. Applicant testified and submitted four exhibits (AE A-AE D). In the\ntime allowed for him to furnish additional documentation, he submitted AE E through I.\nDOHA received the transcript, and the record closed on April 10, 2009. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He remarried in February 2009. He has one child from\na previous marriage. He served in the United States Air Force from March 1983 to\nDecember 2003. According to his security clearance application (SCA) (GE 1), he is\npresently in the active reserves. He has worked as a computer operator for a defense\ncontractor since August 2007. He seeks a security clearance.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR lists 12 delinquent accounts under the financial considerations\nguideline, totaling $50,242. The debts became delinquent between 2002 and 2008 (GE\n3, 4). Applicant admitted all factual allegations except for SOR 1.j., a worthless check\nhis former wife wrote. She provided restitution for the check in 2008 (Tr. 73; GE 4). SOR\n1.j is found in Applicant\u2019s favor, and reduces the total indebtedness to $50,139.\nApplicant\u2019s primary position regarding the listed debts is that his former wife, whom he\nwas married to from January 24, 2004 (GE 1) to November 6, 2008 (AE A), was not\npaying the bills after he left for his overseas job on January 26, 2004. Applicant claims\nhe did not find out about the delinquent bills until June 2007 when he was stateside on\nbusiness at the United States Air Force base in the region (Tr. 61). He testified he found\nhis house a mess and his mortgage behind by 10 months (Tr. 41). GE 3 shows\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage was delinquent three times in 2006. AE B (credit report) indicates,\naccording to the Credit Report Key located at the end of the exhibit, that his mortgage\nwas delinquent 13 times in seven years before January 2009, and overdue by 90 days\non 8 occasions. Yet, the 24-month history on the account, dating from December 2008,\nshows the mortgage delinquent by 30 days on three occasions in 2008, and no\noccasions in 2007. \nApplicant never checked on the status of any of the debts; he claims he never\nreceived notice of any debt problem because all the mail came to his home address in\nthe United States (U.S.), and he was not using any credit cards at his overseas work\nlocation (Tr. 43). \nIn response to the overdue debts identified in SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., 1.k.,  that\n1\neither were past due or became delinquent before Applicant left on his overseas\nemployment on January 26, 2004, he realized the debts were delinquent though he\n\n In his SCA (GE 1), Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to debt questions 27a. (debts over 180 days in the last 7 years)\n2\nand question 27b. (debts at least 90 days delinquent). He then stated he was currently reviewing his finances\nand divorcing his wife, after returning from overseas where he had been working for three years.  \n3\nnever contacted the creditors after the debts became delinquent (Tr. 46). He believed\nhis wife would be making payments on those debts as well (Id.). He stated that:\nYes, because at the time I was getting ready to retire, and at the time my\nmoney was very tight for me, which is one of the main reasons why I too,\nthat job in [European country], was to get out of debt because my income\nin [European country] was not only very good, but it was also tax free\nbecause of the amount of time I stayed there, hence, there again, trying to\ntake care of my financial responsibilities and the work that I do. That\u2019s\nwhat my goal was (Tr. 45).\nSOR 1.a. - credit card ($12,009). The last activity or last payment on this account\nwas in July 2003 (GE 3). Applicant still owes this debt.\nSOR 1.b. - credit card ($11,852). The last activity on this account was June 2003\n(GE 3). Applicant still owes this account. \nSOR 1.c. - credit card ($856). The last activity on this account was October 2005.\nThe debt remains unpaid. \nSOR 1.d. - telephone account ($166). The last activity on this account was in\nDecember 2007.  On March 30, 2009, Applicant was notified his payment of $167.47\npaid the account in full (AE G).\nSOR 1.e. - deficiency balance ($1,483). The last payment on this debt was\nDecember 2002 (GE 3). Applicant indicated under question 27b. of his SCA (GE 1) that\nhis car was repossessed in December 2003.  In his post hearing submission dated April\n2\n2, 2009, Applicant explained that the collection agency for the creditor had gone\nbankrupt, and he would continue to pursue the proper source to pay (AE I). Applicant is\nresponsible for the account. \nSOR 1.f. - ($255). The last activity on this account was December 2003 (GE 3).\nOn March 27, 2009, Applicant paid this $255 (AE E) in full satisfaction of this creditor. \nSOR 1.g. - satellite television ($503). The last activity on this account was in\nMarch 2008, and the account became delinquent in November 2008 (GE 3). Applicant\ntestified he was disputing the debt, and referred to the documentation from the debt\nconsolidation firm (Tr. 47; AE C). On March 29, 2009, Applicant paid the creditor $503\nby credit card to eliminate the delinquent amount, and on March 30, 2009, Applicant\nwas advised his account was zero (AE F). There is no additional information in the\nrecord regarding Applicant\u2019s dispute with the SOR 1.g. creditor. \n\n4\nSOR 1.h. - credit card ($646). The last activity on this account was in November\n2005. Applicant owes this debt. \nSOR 1.i. - credit card ($14,755). The last activity on this account was August\n2003. Applicant still owes the debt. \nSOR 1.j. - insufficient funds check ($103). The check was paid by Applicant\u2019s\nwife in 2008 (AE H). The account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR 1.k. - credit card ($7,071). The last activity on this account was February\n2003. \nSOR 1.l. - unidentified ($543). The last activity on this account was in June 2006.\nApplicant is responsible for this debt. \nOf the 12 listed delinquent accounts that Applicant blamed his wife for not\npaying, activity or payment on five accounts (SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., 1.i., and 1.k.) stopped\nbefore Applicant left on his overseas job in January 2004. The total amount of past due\ndebt on four of the five accounts is $32,415. The total for five accounts is $47,170. The\nremaining seven delinquent debts total $2,969. \nIn his interrogatory responses (GE 2), Applicant indicated he had taken no action\non the debts because he received legal advice recommending he obtain a final divorce\norder to avoid the possibility of having to pay for debt for which he was not legally\nresponsible (GE 2; Tr. 44). No additional evidence was provided regarding the legal\nadvice. \nAlthough Applicant testified he started negotiating with the debt firm (AE C)\nduring the Christmas holidays of 2008 (Tr. 62), the documentation from the debt\nconsolidation firm is dated March 3, 2009 (AE C). Applicant testified he made his first\npayment ($1,000) to the firm in February 2009. No additional documentation was\nprovided regarding the actual service contract or payment. \nApplicant recalled having financial counseling in 1987 while in the service (Tr.\n63). In the future, if he cannot afford an item he intends to buy, he is not going to charge\nit, and he is not going to take out a loan (Id.). \nApplicant remarried in February 2009. His debt consolidation plan (AE C)\nincludes delinquent debts of his current wife totaling about $17,000. Applicant does not\nknow why his wife has financial problems (Tr. 56). \nApplicant is scheduled to begin training on the day after the hearing for a job that\nis located in the Middle East. He is confident he will not have the same financial\nproblems while working overseas that he had with his former wife because the debt firm\npayments come directly out of his checking account, and his current wife has no access\nto the checking account (Id.). In addition, the periods of employment rotations are only\n\n5\n60 to 90 days (AE D), so he can periodically return to the United States, an option that\nhe claimed was not available to him in his previous overseas job (Tr. 56-57).\nHaving carefully observed Applicant as he testified about his financial problems,\nand his claim his wife was supposed to pay the bills while he was working overseas, his\ncredibility is undermined by the amount of debt he knew he had before he departed on\nthe overseas job in January 2004, the overall lack of independent evidence to support\nhis testimony concerning his former wife\u2019s financial responsibilities while he was working\noverseas, and the sketchy evidence describing his financial practices.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s first witness (A) has become good friends with him over the last three\nyears because of common interests, and both serving in the military. Witness A is aware\nof Applicant\u2019s debt problems and his participation in a debt consolidation agency.\nWitness A\u2019s belief Applicant\u2019s former wife was a drug user is based on the information\nApplicant provided him, and on Witness A\u2019s visit to Applicant\u2019s house where he saw\ndrug needles on the floor (Tr. 20). He also believes Applicant\u2019s former wife is the reason\nfor Applicant\u2019s financial problems (Id.). \nWitness B has known Applicant for 10 to 12 years. They met at a horseshoe\ntournament. Applicant told Witness B he was sending money home from his overseas\njob, but his wife was not paying the bills. (Tr. 27). According to Witness B, Applicant\nalso explained he had contacted a debt consolidation agency. \nWitness C, retired from the military after serving 27 years, sees Applicant socially\nabout 15 to 20 times a month. Applicant told Witness C he has a plan and is paying off\nhis creditors (Tr. 32). Witness C believes Applicant is trustworthy (Tr. 33).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n6\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nFC disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts),\nand FC DC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) are applicable to the\ncircumstances of this case. When the SOR was published in January 2009, Applicant\nowed more than $50,000. After tabulating the delinquent accounts in SOR 1.a., 1.b.\n1.e., 1.i., and 1k., more than $47,000, or more than 90% of the larger amount was\ndelinquent in January 2004 when he left for his overseas job. \n\n7\nEvidence of financial problems may be mitigated by FC mitigating condition (MC)\n\u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment), however this condition does not apply.\nSeveral of the debts are six years old, and one became delinquent as recently as 2008.\nThe lack of documented evidence showing payments of the overdue accounts until four\nor five days after the hearing continues to project an adverse impact on Applicant\u2019s\njudgment and reliability.  \nFC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances) generally applies when loss of employment or other unexpected event\nhinders or prevents an individual from handling his financial responsibilities. The\nmitigating condition also requires the individual to act responsibly under the\ncircumstances. The unexpected event in Applicant\u2019s view is his wife\u2019s failure to pay the\nbills as agreed. Applicant\u2019s second claim is he had no way of knowing the bills were not\nbeing paid between January 2004 and June 2007, when he returned on business, and\ninspected his house. Though I do not challenge Applicant\u2019s probable agreement with his\nwife to pay the bills while he was away, the sizable amount of the past due debt should\nhave persuaded Applicant to exert more management over the debts himself. I do not\nfind Applicant\u2019s lack-of-notice claim believable. In sum, FC MC \u00b6 20.b. is inapplicable for\nmitigation as Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances to address the\noverdue debts. \nFC MC \u00b6 20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol) does not apply. Though Applicant testified he received counseling in 1987,\nthere is no evidence that reveals whether he has ever incorporated the counseling in\nthe management of his finances and/or the handling of his delinquent debt. Moreover,\nthere are no clear indications his financial problems are under control. Notwithstanding\nhis claims of negotiating with the debt firm during the Christmas holidays in 2008, his\ndocumentation shows he joined the debt plan in March 2009. Terms of the plan and the\n$1,000 payment Applicant purportedly made are not substantiated. The absence of\nevidence to support Applicant\u2019s testimony about the debt plan, as well as the brief\nperiod of time Applicant has been enrolled in the plan, remove FC MC \u00b6 20.c. from\nconsideration. \nApplicant receives no consideration under FC MC \u00b6 20.d. (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) because he\nwaited more than two months after he received the SOR to take any action on the listed,\ndelinquent debts. Considering the size of his overall debt, the length of time some of the\ndebt was delinquent, and the lack of attention he devoted toward his debt since January\n2004, it is too early for me to conclude that his financial indebtedness is no longer a\nsecurity concern. \n\n8\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the FC guideline. I have also weighed the\ncircumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept.\nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors:\n\u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nIn January 2004, Applicant was about 40 years old. The credit reports show he\nowed more than $32,415 on four past due accounts. With the addition of SOR 1.i., that\nalso became past due before January 2004, the total of past due debt was more that\n$47,000. The existence of an agreement with his wife to pay the debt is not contested.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt situation in January 2004 was different from the\nordinary individual working overseas with delinquent debt. Applicant knew he had the\ndelinquent debt before he went to work overseas. The credit reports indicate the debt\nwas generated before he married his former wife in January 2004. \nThere was much testimony from Applicant\u2019s three friends about his former wife\nbeing a drug user in June 2007 (when Applicant claims he initially discovered the debt\nproblems), and leaving Applicant\u2019s home in disorder with drug needles on the floor. His\nformer wife may have had a drug problem which exacerbated the payment of debts.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s significant past due debt predated their marriage, and the\ntestimony supporting her drug problem has little probative value. On balance, the former\nwife\u2019s drug abuse and financial irresponsibility do not extinguish Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness which he knew about in January 2004. \nApplicant also claimed that as a result of legal advice, he did not act on the\ndelinquent debt sooner. In addition to lacking documentation to support the claim,\nApplicant\u2019s claim is not credible due to his knowledge of at least four (and probably five)\ndelinquent debts when he left for overseas employment in January 2004. \nI have carefully weighed all the evidence. In January 2004, Applicant knew he\nwas carrying a significant amount of past due debt, yet he let his former wife pay the\nbills. He should have monitored the bill paying so that he could intervene to ensure the\nbills were being paid. Instead, he acted irresponsibly under the circumstances in not\nhandling the past due debts in a prudent manner. His enrollment in the debt plan in\nearly March 2009, and his payment of four small debts (10% of the total debt) four days\n\n9\nafter the hearing do not provide me with sufficient confidence to believe he is truly\ncommitted to paying the remaining debt. Though he has provided encouraging\nstatements about how he plans to manage his future financial decisions, his record of\nfinancial irresponsibility makes it probable his current financial problems will persist.\nJudging by the totality of the circumstances, I conclude the FC guideline against\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n\n10\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since 1982, and has held a security clearance throughout his employment. He is also a technical sergeant in the Air National Guard. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1976 to 1980. He served in the National Guard from 1982 to 1988, and again from 1990 to 1999. He joined the Air National Guard in 2000. He received a certificate upon completion of a technical school. He was married from 1978 until his divorce in 2002. He married again in 2002. He has two adult children and three adult stepchildren.1 The SOR alleges five delinquent debts, totaling $18,602. The debts are all credit card or revolving accounts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing all the debts. Since he responded to the SOR, Applicant withdrew funds from his 401(k) and paid or settled in full all the debts. The $4,226 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was settled in full for $2,200 on February 27, 2009. He paid in full the $3,914 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b on or before March 13, 2009.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn December 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 23, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 4, 2009, and reassigned to me on March 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 17, 2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on April 7, \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received without \nobjection. The Government also offered a demonstrative exhibit which was marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through E, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on April 28, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 1982, and has held a security clearance throughout his \nemployment. He is also a technical sergeant in the Air National Guard. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Army from 1976 to 1980. He served in the National Guard from \n1982 to 1988, and again from 1990 to 1999. He joined the Air National Guard in 2000. \nHe received a certificate upon completion of a technical school. He was married from \n1978 until his divorce in 2002. He married again in 2002. He has two adult children and \nthree adult stepchildren.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts, totaling $18,602. The debts are all credit \ncard or revolving accounts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted owing all the \ndebts. Since he responded to the SOR, Applicant withdrew funds from his 401(k) and \npaid or settled in full all the debts. The $4,226 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was settled in \nfull for $2,200 on February 27, 2009. He paid in full the $3,914 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b on or before March 13, 2009. He paid in full the $1,203 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c on \nFebruary 26, 2009. The $4,143 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d had grown to $4,714 by \nFebruary 2009. Applicant paid the full $4,714 on February 26, 2009. The $5,116 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was settled in full for $4,773 on March 5, 2009.2     \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) \ncertified as true on February 7, 2008. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 28a and 28b, \nwhich asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nwife handled their finances. He knew he had debts and his accounts had balances, but \nhe was unaware that she had not been making the payments and permitted the \naccounts to become delinquent. Because his wife kept his financial situation from him, \nApplicant thought he was answering the questions truthfully. He did not find out that he \nhad delinquent debts until the background investigator brought them to his attention \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 20-27; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 27-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A-E.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nafter the SF86 had been submitted.3 After considering all the evidence, I find that \nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his SF86.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 35-37; GE 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns. \nApplicant had a number of delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 \n19(c) as a disqualifying condition.  \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was handling their finances. Without his knowledge she let bills \ngo unpaid, resulting in five delinquent debts. He acted responsibly and paid or settled in \nfull all the delinquent debts. I find that situation is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His financial \nproblems are resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are \nall applicable. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating condition is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant omitted some financial information from his Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions; however, as discussed above, he was unaware that his debts were \ndelinquent. He believed he was answering the questions truthfully. It was not a \ndeliberate omission. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has worked for a defense contractor and held a security clearance for more \nthan 26 years. He has extensive military service in the Army, the National Guard, and \nthe Air National Guard. His wife handled their finances and let bills go unpaid without his \nknowledge. He paid or settled in full all his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s finances do not \nconstitute a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Finding no\nerror, we affirm.  \nThe Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, for such matters as a state\ntax lien, medical bills, credit card bills, and an automobile loan.  Her debts were affected by her\nhusband\u2019s loss of employment as well as her own and by the fact that, at the time he managed the\nhousehold finances, her husband did not keep her apprised of their financial situation.  For example,\nhe did not pay their state income taxes for 2003, 2004, and 2005.  In deciding the case adversely to\nApplicant, the Judge took into account the extent to which Applicant\u2019s financial problems were\naffected by circumstances beyond her control (including job loss and underemployment).  However,\nthe Judge also noted that Applicant\u2019s debts arose, in part, due to poor financial management, and that\nshe has not sought financial counseling.  The Judge further noted that Applicant continues to struggle\nwith her bills and that she lacks a \u201cdefinitive plan of action\u201d to address her financial problems.\nDecision at 8.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider evidence which she believes mitigates the\nsecurity concerns in her case.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in\nthe record, and Applicant\u2019s brief is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).  Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12,\n2007). \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 26, 2009. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on March 3, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 20, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 15, 2009 and I received the case assignment\nJuly 17, 2009\n\nGE 1 (e-QIP) at 6, 14-15; Tr. 25-26, 69-70.\n1\nTr. 23-26.\n2\nId. 24-31, 38; GE 2.\n3\n2\non April 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 20, 2009, and I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on June 4, 2009. The government offered three exhibits (GE)\n1 through 3, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection.\nApplicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted three exhibits (AE) A through C,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 11, 2009. I held the record open until June 29,\n2009, for Applicant to submit additional matters. On June 16, 2009, she submitted 14\nexhibits, AE D through AE Q, without objection. The record closed on June 26, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated she received the notice of hearing more than\n15 days before the hearing date. (Tr. at 12.) Thus, Applicant received the notice of\nhearing date within the requirements of \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive. \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.i,\n1.j, 1.p, and 1.q of the SOR. She denied the remaining factual allegations of the SOR. \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na claims analyst. She began her current employment in November 2007 in a temporary\nposition and became a permanent employee in June 2008.  \n1\nApplicant graduated from college in 2003 with a degree in general studies. She\nenrolled in a Master\u2019s degree program in 2003, but has not completed the program.\nApplicant married in 2002. She and her husband have two children, a son, age 4 and a\ndaughter, age 2. Her husband is a civil engineer.2\nIn 2003, after her son was born, Applicant lost her full-time job. She dropped out\nof her master\u2019s degree program as she could not afford to pay her tuition. She worked a\nvariety of part-time jobs for the next four years while taking care of her children. In 2007,\nshe ran a licensed day care center for seven months. She also worked as a part-time\nfashion designer, work she still performs occasionally. Her husband lost his job in early\n2008 and remained unemployed until October 2008. He did receive unemployment\nbenefits between $1,200 and $1,400 a month.3\n\nTr. 29-30, 67.\n4\nAE F (Applicant\u2019s earnings statement); AE J (Budget); AE N (Husband\u2019s earnings statement); Tr. 85-95.\n5\nGE 2 (Credit report, dated September 10, 2008); GE 3 (Credit report, dated December 5, 2008); GE 4 (Credit\n6\nreport, dated March 27, 2008).\nApplicant provided an itemized list of medical bills being held by a collection service. Except for one $266 bill,\n7\nall the medical bills are for the same hospital. Applicant acknowledges owing money to this hospital. Several\nof the debts listed in the bill are not listed in the SOR. See AE I.\n3\nFrom 2003 until she returned to work in late 2007, Applicant\u2019s husband provided\nthe primary household income. He managed the household finances, which he did not\ndiscuss with Applicant. She is now involved in the household finances.4\nApplicant currently earns $2,620 a month in gross income and $2,097 a month in\nnet income. Her husband earns $3,350 a month in gross income and $2,484 a month in\nnet income. Household net income each month totals $4,581. Household expenses\ninclude $1,375 for rent, $900 for child car, $250 for groceries, $130 for telephone, cable\nand internet, $225 for electric, $50 for water, $40 for church, $125 for education loans,\n$75 for car insurance, $100 for gasoline, $75 for miscellaneous expenses, $200 for\nentertainment, $260 for small bills, $550 for miscellaneous bills, and $135 for another\nbill, for total monthly expenses of $4,490. Applicant\u2019s budget provides some money\neach month towards debt payment in the small bill and miscellaneous bill categories.5\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated March 27, 2008, September 10, 2008,\nDecember 5, 2008, and the SOR, I have compiled a list of the total debts owed,\nexcluding any duplicate entries. I find that Appellant\u2019s actual debts are as follows:6\nSOR \u00b6\nTYPE OF DEBT\nAMOUNT\nSTATUS\nEVIDENCE\n1.a\nState tax lien\n$  5,515.00\n$1,678 actual\ndebt; $1,190 paid. \nGE 2; AE M\n1.b\nCell phone\n$     560.00\nUnpaid; Cannot\nlocated holder of\ndebt\nGE 2; Tr. 40\n1.c\nMedical bill\n$     330.00\nPaid\nAE B; AE I7\n1.d\nMedical bill\n$       75.00\nUnpaid\nAE I\n1.e\nMedical bill\n$       50.00\nPaid\nGE 2, p. 38\n1.f\nMedical bill\n$     250.00\nUnpaid\nAE I\n1.g\nMedical bill\n$       50.00\nPaid\nGE 2, p. 38\n1.h\nMedical bill\n$       50.00\nUnpaid\nAE I\n\nGE 2; AE M.

When she learned about the tax lien, Applicant contacted the\nstate tax office which recommended that they itemize their deductions. She hired a tax\naccounting firm to work with her on this issue. With this firm\u2019s assistance, she reduced\nher tax liability from $5,515 to $1,465 plus $213 in interest. She paid $300 and the state\ngarnished her husband\u2019s bank account. As a result of its garnishment, the state\nreceived $890 towards the tax lien debt, leaving a balance of $498, including interest.\nHer state tax lien remains as she owes taxes for 2008. Her total current tax liability is\n$1,185. She plans to develop a repayment plan, but has not provided evidence of a plan\nor payments.8\nApplicant purchased a car in 2004. She paid the monthly payments for a period\nof time, but fell behind in her payments. Her car was repossessed in 2007. Two\ncreditors notified Applicant that they held the debt on her car. One creditor is a\ncollection agency and the other creditor is an out-of-state law firm. Applicant negotiated\na $7,500 settlement of her car loan with the law firm in early 2008. She obtained funds\nfrom a relative to pay the settlement. She paid $1,000 in January 2008 to the law firm\nand asked for an invoice. The law firm refused to provide an invoice to her. In\nSeptember 2008, Applicant received notice that the debt had been transferred to the\ncollection agency. The $1,000 payment is not referenced in the documents received\nfrom the collection agency. Applicant again negotiated a monthly payment plan, but has\nnot complied with the plan. She has requested an invoice from this company, which has\nnot been provided. Another law firm may now be involved in the collection of this debt.\n\nGE 2, p. 30-31, 53-61.\n9\nAE E; Tr. 61-63.\n10\nGE 2; AE K.\n11\nAE G; AE H.\n12\n5\nApplicant does not know who owns the debt at the present time and is not making\npayments until she can determine who holds the debt and what is actually owed.9\nApplicant verified that education loans with the federal government are\nconsolidated and currently in forbearance. She has another education loan with the\nstate. Although she believes this loan is consolidated with her other education loans,\nshe has not provided evidence that supports her belief.10\nThe government forwarded interrogatories to Applicant in August 2008, seeking\ninformation about 16 debts. Applicant responded, providing proof that she had paid four\ndebts and made payments on three other debts. She also indicated she contacted her\ncreditors, but had not fully resolved the debts. She also showed she obtained a small\nloan from her credit union which she has paid.  \n11\nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluation shows an overall rating of\nsatisfactory. She received a mix of excellent and satisfactory ratings on the individual\nelements. Her customers praise her manner and skills in working with them.  \n12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n6\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts over a period of time. She\nhas been unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n\n7\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries began in 2003 and continue. The potentially mitigating\ncondition is not applicable.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems began when she worked part-time. Her problems increased when her\nhusband lost his job just as she returned to work full-time. His job loss decreased the\namount of household income available to repay debts. Despite the loss of his income,\nshe has paid her usual living expenses and some of her smaller debts since he did\nreceive unemployment benefits. She acted reasonably under the circumstances. I find\nthis potentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial\ncounseling. Although some debts are paid, she has not demonstrated that her finances\nare under control. This mitigating condition is not applicable.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant resolved\nseveral of her delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. She has not resolved\nall of her debts, particularly her larger debts. I conclude this  mitigating condition\npartially applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n8\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began\nwhen she lost her full-time employment. She continued to work, but generally on a part-\ntime basis while she cared for her young children. Just after she returned to full-time\nemployment, her husband lost his job and did not find another job for over nine months.\nShe accumulated debt, due in part, to circumstances largely beyond her control,\nincluding job loss and underemployment. Her debts also arose, in part, because of poor\nfinancial management. She has taken steps to resolve some of her debts even before\nshe received the interrogatories or SOR. She developed payment plans, but did not\ncomply with the terms of her agreements. She continues to struggle with her bills, in\npart because she does not have a definitive plan of action. Her efforts at resolution of\nher debts are commendable, but she needs to do more before she is granted a security\nclearance. She needs to establish a consistent track record of managing her finances,\npayment of debt and compliance with debt repayment plans.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Finding no\nerror, we affirm.  \nThe Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, for such matters as a state\ntax lien, medical bills, credit card bills, and an automobile loan.  Her debts were affected by her\nhusband\u2019s loss of employment as well as her own and by the fact that, at the time he managed the\nhousehold finances, her husband did not keep her apprised of their financial situation.  For example,\nhe did not pay their state income taxes for 2003, 2004, and 2005.  In deciding the case adversely to\nApplicant, the Judge took into account the extent to which Applicant\u2019s financial problems were\naffected by circumstances beyond her control (including job loss and underemployment).  However,\nthe Judge also noted that Applicant\u2019s debts arose, in part, due to poor financial management, and that\nshe has not sought financial counseling.  The Judge further noted that Applicant continues to struggle\nwith her bills and that she lacks a \u201cdefinitive plan of action\u201d to address her financial problems.\nDecision at 8.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider evidence which she believes mitigates the\nsecurity concerns in her case.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in\nthe record, and Applicant\u2019s brief is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n2008).  Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12,\n2007). \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Around 1998, Applicant\u2019s second marriage was falling apart, and he began to satisfy his personal needs by viewing erotic materials in the Internet.

Roberts, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of child pornography from 1998 to February 2005 is not mitigated \nby the passage of time. His favorable evidence hardly outweighs the seriousness of his \noffenses. He minimized his questionable behavior during his hearing, showing that he \nlacks reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 18, 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). \nOn February 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as modified \nOctober 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nand revised.1 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and it recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn March 16, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on April 30, 2009. Because of case scheduling concerns, it was \nreassigned to me on May 27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 28, 2009. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 22, 2009. The government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified on his own behalf, presented one expert witness, and submitted \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 8, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 6, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He denied \nall the remaining SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old senior security business consultant working as director \nof security for a defense contractor. He graduated from college in 1977, and received a \nBachelor of Science degree in physics. He completed his Master of Science degree \n(computer science in information security) in 2006. He has been married three times \nand divorced twice. He married his first wife in 1973, and was divorced in 1982. He \nmarried his second wife in 1985, and they were divorced in 2003. Applicant has a 23-\nyear-old son (adopted) from this marriage. In 2006, he married his current wife, and \nthey live happily together. He has two stepchildren ages 18 and 15. \n \nAround 1998, Applicant\u2019s second marriage was falling apart, and he began to \nsatisfy his personal needs by viewing erotic materials in the Internet. Between 1998 and \n2005, he sought out whatever pornographic material was available to masturbate and \ncope with his personal situation. Most of the pornographic material he found and saw \nwas legal and did not involve minors or child pornography. Applicant estimated that \nbetween 1998 and 2003, he saw approximately 10 images that were illegal (involved \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines in all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nunderage girls) and that he masturbated while viewing them four or five times (GE 2, I-\n5). \n \nAs his insecurity and loneliness increased, he began to selectively find images of \nyoung women and to view them preferentially. These included images of girls who could \nhave been 14 to 15 years old, either naked or engaged in some form of sexual activity. \nIn 2004, Applicant was using what he believed was probably illegal material once a \nmonth and occasionally as much as twice a week. To be able to see the images, \nApplicant had to download the files onto his computer. He had three files in his \ncomputer that he believed were illegal. He deleted these files in the fall of 2004. He \nnever shared, copied, distributed, or sent illegal images to anyone (GE 2, I-5). \n \nApplicant stated that in the fall of 2004, he met his present wife and by February \n2005, he had stopped his behavior. He married his wife in 2006. He expressed remorse \nfor his behavior numerous times. He claimed he was no longer in denial about the \nseriousness of his offense. He admitted that his judgment was poor, and that he had \nviolated the law and was very ashamed of that fact. Applicant promised that his \nquestionable behavior will not happen again. He has learned to control his impulses. He \naverred that other than this failure, he has always abided by the law.  \n \nApplicant loves America and he is very good at what he does. He believes he \nhas something to offer and would like to continue working for the government and \nserving his country. He has been successfully working for several government \ncontractors. He affirmed that he can be trusted to serve with honor and integrity (GE 2). \nApplicant takes the security clearance process seriously. He averred he has been \ntruthful, honest, and forthcoming throughout the whole process. Applicant believes he \nhas learned his lesson and is rehabilitated.  \n \nBetween 1978 and 2003, Applicant worked in several small businesses \nperforming computer repairs, and worked as an adjunct professor at a state university.2 \nHe was involved in community projects fostering good will and community relations. He \nalso was involved in leadership roles teaching young people to use computers. \nAdditionally, he was involved in community environmental and conservation groups. \nBased on the government background interviews, Applicant was considered to be an \nupstanding member of the community, respected and well-regarded by his neighbors, \nfriends, and co-workers. Outside of the pending allegations, there is no evidence that he \nwas involved in any additional questionable behavior. \n \nApplicant moved to another state in 2003, and started working for government \ncontractors. He received access to classified information at the secret level in July 2003. \nHis access was upgraded to a top secret clearance in September 2004. In 2007, his \nemployer recognized him as the company\u2019s most valuable player (AE 6, Tr. 123-4). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever failed to follow security procedures or that \nhe has compromised classified information. \n \n2  In 2003, he received an outstanding faculty award from the university (AE 6). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nBetween June 2004 and April 2005, Applicant was considered for access to \nclassified information by another government agency. In August 2004, Applicant \nunderwent a security clearance interview in which he denied ever being involved in any \ndetected or undetected illegal activities (GE 2, at I-13). After further interviews, in April \n2005, Applicant admitted seeking pornography depicting underage girls via the Internet \nfrom 1998 to February 2005. He admitted downloading this type of pornography at least \nthree times. During the interview, Applicant stated that the youngest individual depicted \nin this type of pornography that he viewed was around five years old and the oldest was \naround 16 years old. The other agency denied Applicant\u2019s request for access to \nclassified information because of criminal conduct and personal conduct security \nconcerns, specifically, for his lack of candor throughout his security process (GE 2, at I-\n13). \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant submitted the pending security clearance application. In \nAugust 2007, he was interview by a DoD investigator concerning his prior security \nclearance denial. He explained that, during a 2004-2005 interview with another \ngovernment agency, he was asked whether he had ever seen prohibited material in the \nInternet and he said \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant claimed that during a second interview two weeks \nlater he volunteered that he had looked at prohibited material (Internet pictures of nude \nfemales, approximately 14 years old, involved in sexual acts). He stated that the \npornographic material would have been legal except for the age of the females. \nApplicant further stated that since February 2005, he had not been involved with any \ntype of pornography, that he had not received any counseling and had dealt with the \nsituation on his own, and that the only person who knew about his past questionable \nbehavior was his wife (GE 2, at I-8). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied many of the prior statements he made to \ngovernment investigators in 2004-2005, 2007, and in his 2008 answers to DOHA \ninterrogatories. He testified that: he did not believe he was looking at child pornography \n(Tr. 127); he did not seek out the images of underage girls (Tr. 127, 133); he deleted \nwhat he believed were illegal images of children immediately (Tr. 127); he maybe saw \nillegal pictures, but he does not know for a fact that he did (Tr. 130); if there was any \nindication that the picture included underage children he would not open it (Tr. 148); and \nhe denied seeing illegal images of a five-year-old child. Considering the record evidence \nas a whole, Applicant\u2019s denials are not credible. \n \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant admitted that on four or five occasions he \nopened images that were clearly illegal. He claimed that he immediately closed the \nimages and discarded the files. He strongly denied ever seeking pictures of young \nchildren. However, he admitted seeking pictures of young women that appeared to be \nunderage. When confronted about the factual differences between his testimony and \nthe June 20, 2005, security clearance denial letter, Applicant averred that the other \nagency was confused about what he saw and deleted and what he downloaded and \nkept. Applicant never appealed or attempted to correct the allegations on the June 2005 \ndenial letter. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant testified he is horrendously embarrassed and humiliated by his actions. \nHe claimed he has learned from his \u201chuge mistake\u201d and promised never to repeat his \nbehavior again. He averred that looking at pornography is no longer part of his life, and \nthat he feels guilty about his past behavior. He is now happily married and in a stable \nrelationship. Applicant has disclosed his questionable behavior only to his wife and one \nfriend. Nobody else in his family, group of friends, and co-workers knows about his \nquestionable behavior. \n \nApplicant presented six character letters from longtime friends and co-workers \n(AE 8). All of his references consider Applicant to be honest, trustworthy, and of high \nmoral character. He was commended for his judgment, maturity, work ethic, and overall \nperformance. All of his references recommended that he receive access to classified \ninformation without reservations. Only one of his references is aware of the SOR \nallegations (Tr. 141). \n \nAdditionally, Applicant presented the testimony of a psychiatrist (with a \nsubspecialty in addiction medicine) as an expert witness (AE 2, Tr. 22-89). The doctor \nprepared two written assessments of Applicant, the first on June 10, 2009 (GE 5). This \nassessment was prepared without considering the SOR, Applicant\u2019s answers to it, and \nhis prior statements to investigators. The second assessment was prepared on June 20, \n2009 (AE 2), after considering the above mentioned documents, but not the June 2005 \ndenial letter. Applicant\u2019s final assessment was also based on two sessions totaling four \nhours. \n \nIn the doctor\u2019s opinion, Applicant tends to be somewhat obsessive. He considers \nApplicant to be a truthful person. He believes Applicant did not seek child pornography \nintentionally, and that Applicant\u2019s viewings of such materials were incidental. In his \nassessment, the doctor concluded that Applicant\u2019s attraction to young women is not \npathological; that his seeking pornography from 1998 to 2005, does not show \ncompulsive behavior; and that his behavior is not likely to recur and is clearly under \ncontrol. In the doctor\u2019s view, it is not clear to Applicant or to the doctor whether \nApplicant actually viewed images of underage subjects engaged in sexual acts. \n \nIn conclusion, the doctor found no evidence of mental illness, personality \ndisorders, or any other problem requiring treatment. He did not see anything that would \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \n\n \n6 \n \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nFrom about 1998 to February 2005, Applicant knowingly accessed, viewed, and \ndownloaded from the Internet images of underage girls who were engaged in sexual \nactivity. He used the images for his own sexual gratification and masturbated while \nviewing the images. Applicant\u2019s behavior violated Section 2252A of Title 18 of the U.S. \nCode (USC), and constitutes a felony offense.3 His behavior triggers the applicability of \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information \nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, \nsuch as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.\u201d \n \nApplicant denied that he was denied access to classified information by another \ngovernment agency in June 2005, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. I find that he was denied \naccess because of the information that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and because of his lack \nof candor during that other agency\u2019s security processing. SOR \u00b6 1.c does not allege \ndistinct personal conduct by Applicant. It alleges the agency\u2019s response to his conduct. \nThat conduct was adequately addressed by the other agency that had all the underlying \nfacts for its decision. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. His denial of access by \nanother government agency will be considered under the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \n \n3  The statute defines \u201cminor\u201d as any person under the age of 18 years. \u201cChild pornography\u201d is \ndefined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct where a minor is involved. 18 USC 2256.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), \n17(f), and 17(g) do not apply to the facts of this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 \n17(c), and determined it does not apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior constitutes very serious \nfelony offenses that continue to cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply because, at his hearing, Applicant recanted \nhis prior admissions to government agents and minimized his illegal behavior, \nnotwithstanding his previous admissions. AG \u00b6 17(e) partially applies because Applicant \npresented some evidence to show he has taken positive steps to reduce his \nvulnerability to exploitation or manipulation, e.g., he no longer uses pornographic \nmaterials, he is happily married in a stable relationship, he disclosed to his spouse his \npast illegal behavior, and he disclosed to one friend the SOR allegations. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant is still vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nbecause of his work, and most of his friends, family members, and co-workers are not \naware of his past questionable behavior. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nFrom about 1998 to February 2005, Applicant knowingly accessed, viewed, \ndownloaded from the Internet, and stored in his computer images of underage girls who \nwere engaged in sexual activity. He used the images for his own sexual gratification and \nmasturbated while viewing the images. Applicant\u2019s behavior violated Section 2252A of \nTitle 18 of the U.S. Code (USC), and constitutes a felony offense.4 His behavior raises \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nAfter considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and (d) \npartially apply. Applicant\u2019s last use of child pornography was in February 2005, and as \nsuch, it may be considered somewhat remote.  \n \n \nApplicant averred his criminal behavior was caused by unusual circumstances \nand that it is unlikely to recur. He used pornography to cope with the loneliness created \nby his failing marriage. He argued that he has changed his lifestyle and circumstances. \nHe has moved, has new friends, a successful job, and is now happily married. Applicant \nexpressed remorse numerous times, and he has been successful working for several \ngovernment contractors. He has not accessed any type of pornography since February \n2005, because of the embarrassment and humiliation he has endured. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has been involved in any other misconduct after February 2005.  \n \n \nNotwithstanding, I find Applicant was not candid during his testimony. His \ntestimony conflicted in several areas with the file evidence, including his prior \nstatements to security clearance investigators, his answers to DOHA interrogatories, \nand his admissions to the SOR. I find Applicant\u2019s attempt to minimize his past illegal \n                                            \n4  See footnote 3, supra.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nbehavior weighs against a finding of successful rehabilitation. The Guideline J security \nconcern is not mitigated. \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior,  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 describes the concern about sexual behavior: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 13 provides four conditions relating to sexual behavior that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nFrom about 1998 to February 2005, Applicant knowingly accessed, viewed, \ndownloaded from the Internet, and stored in his computer images of underage girls who \nwere engaged in sexual activity. He used the images for his own sexual gratification and \nmasturbated while viewing the images. His conduct constitutes a felony.  \n \nHis behavior still makes him vulnerable to coercion because of the nature of his \nwork, the statute of limitations has not lapsed, and his family, friends, and co-workers \nare not aware of his past behavior. Applicant receives credit for disclosing the \ninformation to his wife and one friend; however, that does not fully eliminate his \nvulnerability concerns.  \n \nI conclude Applicant was involved in a pattern of high risk sexual behavior \nbecause he sought child pornography during a period of approximately seven years. He \nknew that viewing child pornography was illegal and he continued to visit the sites that \ndepicted such material in an increasingly frequent basis. At his hearing, Applicant \n\n \n11 \n \n \nclaimed that his viewing of child pornography was incidental to his search for legal \npornographic material. I find his claim not credible in light of his past statements to \nsecurity personnel, his answers to DOHA interrogatories, and his admissions to the \nSOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(b), and 13(c) apply and create a concern. AG \u00b6 13(d) partially \napplies because his behavior shows a lack of judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply to this case. Concerning AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c), the \ngovernment cross-alleged the conduct involved in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a. The \nanalysis and comments contained in the Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct \ndiscussions, supra, are incorporated under this subheading.  \n \n \nApplicant sought child pornography during a period of approximately seven \nyears. His last use of child pornography was around February 2005, and as such, it may \nbe considered somewhat remote. I disagree with Applicant\u2019s assertion that his \nquestionable behavior was caused by unusual circumstances. Marital separation and \ndivorce, although emotionally painful to many, are not necessarily unusual \ncircumstances in our society. Applicant\u2019s evidence shows that during his separation \nperiod, he was able to continue a normal life, was successful at work, and significantly \ncontributed to his community as an educator, leader, and advocate.  \n \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his past behavior. He has been successful \nworking for several government contractors since 2003. He is now happily married, and \nhe has not accessed any type of pornography since February 2005. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has been involved in any other misconduct after February 2005. \nThese factors indicate that his prior questionable behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, I find Applicant was not candid during his testimony. His \ntestimony conflicted with the file evidence, including his prior statements to security \nclearance investigators, his answers to DOHA interrogatories, and his admissions to the \nSOR. I find Applicant\u2019s attempt to minimize his past illegal behavior casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior was \n\n \n12 \n \n \nprivate and discrete. AG \u00b6 14(d) fully applies; however, it does not mitigate the sexual \nbehavior security concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. He was successful as a college professor and was well-regarded in his \ncommunity for his leadership and involvement in community activities. Since 2003, he \nhas been successful working for several defense contractors. He has established a \nreputation as a valuable, dedicated and reliable employee. There is no evidence he has \never compromised classified information or committed any security violations. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for his questionable behavior and seems resolute in avoiding similar \nbehavior. There is no evidence of any mental illness or personality disorder, and \ncounseling was not required. Additionally, Applicant is married and in a stable \nrelationship. His wife knows about his questionable behavior. He promised never to \naccess any type of pornography again. These factors show responsibility, good \njudgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant deliberately sought child pornography for \napproximately seven years notwithstanding his knowledge of the illegality of his actions \nand the risks associated with it. He continued to seek child pornography after he moved, \nchanged jobs, and met his current wife. It is questionable whether Applicant would have \ndiscontinued his child pornography use but for the security clearance process.  \n \nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his personal conduct, criminal conduct, and \nsexual behavior. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence hardly outweighs the seriousness of his \n\n \n13 \n \n \noffense. Overall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJune 8, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) dated August 11, 2005.  On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 2, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on April 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 8, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for May 6, 2009.  The Government offered nine exhibits, referred\nto as Government Exhibits 1 through 9, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered ten exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through J, that were\nadmitted into evidence.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open\nuntil close of business on June 6, 2009 to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit\nadditional documentation.  The Applicant submitted no additional documentation.  The\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on May 19, 2009.  Based upon a review of\n\n2\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nhis testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 58 years old and has a high school\ndiploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Aircraft Mechanic and is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR, except 1(p),\nunder this guideline.  He has at least twenty-five separate delinquent accounts totaling\napproximately $ 43,000.00.  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated January 25, 2007 and\nSeptember 29, 2007, collectively reflect each of the outstanding debts listed in the SOR.\n(See Government Exhibits 2 and 3).     \nPrior to 2001,  the Applicant was employed with the same defense contractor for\nsixteen years.  (See Government Exhibit 1). At some point, he was laid off for lack of\nwork.  In May 2005, he received a letter from his previous employer with an offer to\nreturn to work, but he needed a security clearance to do so.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  In\nAugust 2005, the Applicant completed the requisite security clearance application and\nhis background investigation began. \nApplicant explained that before his finances became an issue, a number of other\nquestions arose during the investigation that did not actually concern him, but were\nfound to be people with his same name.  These matters were resolved favorably for the\nApplicant.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that before November 2007, his bills were\npaid on time.  In November 2007, he was diagnosed with lung cancer.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit F).  He then went out on disability and underwent surgery.  Following his\nsurgery, he was laid off from work.  He had no medical insurance at the time and the\nbills started falling behind.  He was not employed again until August 2008, when he\nworked for six weeks before being laid off again.  None of the Applicant\u2019s job lay-offs\nwere his fault, but were due to industry downsizing.  \nIn April or May 2008, he was diagnosed with a growth on his tongue and in his\nthroat that was initially thought to be cancer.  The Applicant still had no medical\n\n3\ninsurance.  This caused more financial difficulties.  The Applicant used his\nunemployment check to pay for the basic necessities, such as food and rent.  He\nincurred medical bills, credit card debt and federal income tax debt that he simply could\nnot afford to pay.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F, H, I and J).    \nIn 2007, he hired a law firm to assist him with his indebtedness, but they did\nnothing to help him.  He fired them, and in 2008, hired another lawyer who recently filed\na petition for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on behalf of the Applicant.  It took some time for the\nApplicant to complete the fee arrangement that he was paying on a monthly basis that\nwould get the Bankruptcy started.  That is the reason why the bankruptcy petition was\nnot filed on an earlier date.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  Each of the debts listed in the SOR\nhave been included in Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition, except the two federal tax debts\nin the amounts of $650.78 and $58.00 respectively.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  In February\n2009, Applicant was diagnosed with COPD and was hospitalized for four days.\n                            \nPresently, the Applicant\u2019s brother and son are living with the Applicant and\nassisting him financially with paying for food and rent, providing an additional $500.00\nper month.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). He remains on unemployment but is still eligible for\nre-hire by his previous employer if he obtains a security clearance.  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s coworkers, friends and landlord\nattest to his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  He is described as honest,\nconscientious, detail oriented and punctual.  He is highly trusted, and a person who\ngives an honest days work for an honest days pay.  He is an individual who carries out\nhis duties and responsibilities with vigor and resolve and who is an asset to any\norganization.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n\n4\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances:\n20(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\n\n5\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that the Applicant\u2019s\nexcessive indebtedness and financial hardship was caused by his recent illnesses and\nlong periods of unemployment.  Even though he currently remains on unemployment,\nhe sought out financial counseling and hired an attorney who filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\nto discharge the debt.  Most of the debt is for medical bills and other expenses that he\ncould not afford to pay during this time.  Given his excessive indebtedness and his\ncurrent situation, he has done his best and has made a good faith effort to resolve them.\nOnce his debts are discharged, he will have a fresh start.  Once his employment begins,\nhe should no longer have any problems paying his bills on time, as he fully understands\nthe importance of living within ones means.  In the event that he has any future financial\nproblems, his security clearance would immediately be in jeopardy.  Considering all of\nthe evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nUnder Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts and, 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However,\n\n6\nMitigating Conditions 20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control and, 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\nThere is evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  The Applicant has\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.p.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.u.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n    Subpara.  1.w.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nFor the Applicant.\n                                    Subpara.  1.y.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.z.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted four allegations and denied five. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old, a high school graduate, and employed by a government contractor. In March 2005, Applicant retired and received an honorable discharge after serving for 25 years in the U.S. military. He was first awarded a security clearance in 1988 during his military service. He now seeks a security clearance as a government contractor. (Ex. 1; Tr. 57-61.) Applicant was married for the first time in 1971. Two children were born to the marriage. He and his first wife divorced in 1979. Applicant married for the second time in 1982. He and his second wife have three children, one of whom is deceased. Applicant and his second wife have been separated, but not divorced, since May 1989. His wife does not participate in Applicant\u2019s health insurance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 64-65, 105-106.) Applicant currently lives in a spouse-like relationship with a woman who has two young children from a previous relationship. Applicant contributes to the support of the woman\u2019s children. He also has a four-year-old child from another relationship, who lives elsewhere with his mother. Monthly child support payments of $809 are deducted from his military retirement pay for the support of the four-year-old. (Ex. L; Tr. 10",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on September 26, 2005. He was interviewed about his financial \nissues by authorized investigators from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) on January 4, 2007 and June 27, 2007. On October 21, 2008, Applicant \nprovided a notarized response to interrogatories posed by the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On January 30, 2009, DOHA issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nJune 26, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 27, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 2, \n2009. I convened a hearing on May 13, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which were marked Ex. 1 \nthrough 6 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and called no witnesses. He introduced thirteen exhibits, which were marked as \nEx. A through M and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on May 21, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains nine allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted four allegations and denied five. Applicant\u2019s admissions are included herein as \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old, a high school graduate, and employed by a \ngovernment contractor. In March 2005, Applicant retired and received an honorable \ndischarge after serving for 25 years in the U.S. military. He was first awarded a security \nclearance in 1988 during his military service. He now seeks a security clearance as a \ngovernment contractor.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 57-61.) \n \n \nApplicant was married for the first time in 1971. Two children were born to the \nmarriage. He and his first wife divorced in 1979. Applicant married for the second time \nin 1982. He and his second wife have three children, one of whom is deceased. \nApplicant and his second wife have been separated, but not divorced, since May 1989. \nHis wife does not participate in Applicant\u2019s health insurance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 64-65, 105-106.)  \n \n \nApplicant currently lives in a spouse-like relationship with a woman who has two \nyoung children from a previous relationship. Applicant contributes to the support of the \nwoman\u2019s children. He also has a four-year-old child from another relationship, who lives \nelsewhere with his mother. Monthly child support payments of $809 are deducted from \nhis military retirement pay for the support of the four-year-old. (Ex. L; Tr. 107-109, 114-\n115.) \n \n \nApplicant owes a tax lien of $18,0561 to the Internal Revenue Service. The lien, \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a., was filed in May 1996. Applicant\u2019s wife filed taxes in the late \n1980s and early 1990s that claimed their three children as dependents. Applicant also \n \n1 This figure includes interest and penalties. (Ex. 2 at 7-8.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nclaimed the children as dependents, and he did not change his tax status to reflect that \nthe children were not his dependents. Applicant made $500 monthly payments on the \ntax debt from 1994 to about the beginning of 1997. When he changed his job and status \nfrom active reserve to active duty, money to pay the federal tax lien was not deducted \nfrom his pay, although he was aware that the federal government was intercepting his \nannual federal tax refunds for several years to pay the delinquent tax lien. (Ex. 2 at 7-8; \nEx. 3 at 2; Tr. 62-63.) \n \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant hired a tax representation firm to assist him in \nresolving his federal tax delinquency. He has not filed required documents with the firm, \nand until it receives the documents from Applicant, it cannot prepare his amended tax \nreturns and move forward in representing him. Applicant has made two payments of \napproximately $1100 to the tax representation firm. One of the two payments was \ndelinquent, and it was not clear whether it had been received and credited to Applicant\u2019s \naccount. Applicant\u2019s checking account of November 2008 showed a payment of $430 to \nthe tax representation firm on November 7, 2008. At the time of his hearing, the matter \nof Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal tax lien remained unresolved. (Ex. A; Ex. J; Tr.65-69.)  \n \n \n Applicant opened an account with a creditor for a debit card. He overspent the \namount on the card and did not replace the overspent amount, which totaled $2,373. \nApplicant thought he opened the account in June 2004; however, his credit reports \nindicated he opened the account in 2000, and the account was charged off in \nSeptember 2003.  Applicant denied the debt, which was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b.  (Ex. 2 at \n19; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Tr. 69-71.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant admitted owing the creditor the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. In response to DOHA interrogatories, he provided a letter to the creditor, dated \nOctober 21, 2008, requesting resolution of the debt.  Applicant had not received a reply \nfrom the creditor, and the debt remained unresolved. (Ex. 2 at 19; Tr. 70-71.) \n \n \nApplicant acquired a loan from a creditor in 2004.  He fell behind in his payments, \nand the account was charged off in April 2005. Applicant owed the creditor $5,137. This \ndelinquency was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant arranged for monthly deductions of \n$250 to be made from his checking account to the creditor. Then, his bank went out of \nbusiness and was taken over by another bank. The second bank failed to make the \nauthorized deductions, and the account became delinquent again.  Applicant provided \ndocuments to corroborate his statement that he had contacted the second bank and \nauthorized the deductions to begin again. He provided documents showing that the \nauthorized deductions had been made in August, October, and November 2008. (Ex. 4; \nEx. E; Ex. F; Ex. G; Tr. 71-74.) \n \n \nApplicant purchased an automobile, and because of his bad credit, was required \na pay a high interest rate. He fell behind in his payments, and the automobile was \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nrepossessed. He owes the creditor approximately $6,5932 on the automobile debt. This \ndebt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 74.) \n \n \nThe creditor wrote to Applicant on March 9, 2009 and offered to settle the debt \nfor $1,844.81, provided Applicant remitted the full amount on or before March 25, 2009.  \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated he had not responded to the creditor\u2019s offer and planned \nto pay the debt at some unspecified future date. (Ex. D; Tr. 74-76.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.e. that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $432 to a \ncredit card company.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt. However, at \nhis hearing, he provided letters, dated November 3, 2008, from the creditor stating that \nthe debt had been transferred to successor creditor. The original creditor provided \ninformation for contacting the successor creditor. Applicant acknowledged the debt and \nstated he had made no arrangements to contact the creditor to satisfy the debt. (Ex. B; \nEx. C; Tr. 76-77.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g. that Applicant was responsible for two \njudgments levied by unidentified medical providers and the judgments had not been \nsatisfied. The judgment alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. was for $1,294. The judgment alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.g was for $1,488. Both judgments were shown on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreport of November 17, 2008. Applicant denied both debts. He denied knowledge of any \ncourt actions filed against him for unpaid medical debts. He stated that as a former \nservice member, his medical services were provided by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and he had no need to seek medical services from the private sector. The \ngovernment acknowledged that the credit report was the only evidence it had showing \nthe judgments against Applicant. Applicant provided a credit report, dated May 7, 2009, \nwhich did not list any judgments against Applicant for unpaid medical debts. I found that \nthe evidence not sufficient to conclude that Applicant was responsible for the judgments \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g.  (Ex. 6; Ex. M; Tr. 79-83.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.h. that Applicant owed a delinquent debt of $6,575.  \nApplicant provided documentation to corroborate his statement that he had in place a \npayment plan authorizing a monthly allotment of $228 from his military retirement pay to \nsatisfy the debt.  (Ex. L; Tr. 77-78.) \n \n \nApplicant denied he owed debt of $1,005 to a bank creditor, although he \nacknowledged he may have owed a credit card with the same name as the bank.  This \ndebt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.i. The debt was identified on Applicant\u2019s credit report of \nNovember 2005. The government acknowledged that it had no other evidence of the \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s credit report of May 7, 2009 did not list the debt. I found the evidence \nnot sufficient to conclude that Applicant was responsible for the debt. (Ex. 3; Ex. M; Tr. \n83-84.)  \n \n \n2 A letter from the creditor, dated March 9, 2009, identified the amount of the debt as $5,951.02. (Ex. D.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant does not have a 401 K plan, and he does not have a savings account.  \nHe does not own a vehicle.  He has two checking accounts.  He has not received formal \nfinancial credit counseling.  (Tr. 83-86, 90-92.) \n \n \nApplicant reports a monthly net income of approximately $4,000 from his job as a \nfederal contractor. In addition, he nets $1,042 each month in military retirement pay, \nafter deductions for allocations to pay down the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h. and $809 in \nchild support.  (Ex. K; Ex. L; Tr. 110-111.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly fixed expenses are as follows: rent: $1,465; utilities: $400; \nfood: $300; clothing: $100; and day care: $250. He reports a net monthly remainder of \napproximately $2,500.  (Tr. 111-114.)   \n \n  \n                                                  Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n6 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might \n\n \n7 \n \n \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual initiated a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d)).  Finally, security concerns \nrelated to financial delinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(e)).   \n \nApplicant=s federal tax lien arose in the 1990s and remained unresolved even \nthough he had reliable and stable employment. While he employed a tax resolution firm \nto assist him in resolving the matter with the Internal Revenue Service, he failed to \nprovide the firm with the necessary documents to begin the resolution process. \nApplicant\u2019s large unresolved tax lien of over $18,000 raises security concerns which \ncontinue to the present day, a situation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment.   \n \nTo his credit, Applicant has made efforts to resolve the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c. and 1.h. He provided documentation and testimony to dispute the legitimacy of the \ndebts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i. However, he had not yet made a \ncommitment to begin regular and consistent payment of the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b., 1.d., and 1.e. Despite some good faith efforts to pay some of his debts, Applicant \nhas not demonstrated a track record of timely payments. It is not clear that he will be \nable to manage his finances and avoid financial delinquency in the future. Curiously, he \nhas not arranged payment plans and set aside money to meet several of   his financial \ndelinquencies, despite his substantial monthly net remainder. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(d) and 20(e) apply partially in mitigation, but that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) do \nnot apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nmore than ten years ago, when he was a mature adult. He has known he owed a \nfederal tax lien since the mid-1990s.  While he engaged a tax resolution firm to assist \nhim in resolving the lien, he failed to timely provide the firm with the documents \nnecessary to initiate the resolution process. His failure to address this and three other \nfinancial delinquencies over a significant period of time raises concerns about his \njudgment and reliability. \n \nTo his credit, Applicant has taken action to address and successfully dispute \nsome of his delinquencies. However, these actions are recent and do not demonstrate a \ntrack record of satisfaction of debt consistently over time. He does not have a plan to \nresolve his remaining debts and to avoid financial problems in the future.  \n \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date this \ndecision becomes final.  If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the \nGovernment\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f. through 1.i.: For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nAugust 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines E, M, and D. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nFebruary 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 9, 2008; answered it on September \n24, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on September 29, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 26, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on December 4, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on December 29, 2008, scheduling the hearing for January \n12, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The \nrecord closed upon adjournment of the hearing on January 12, 2009. DOHA received \nthe transcript (Tr.) on January 26, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR and \noffered explanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old systems engineer for a federal contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since August 2004 (Tr. 32). He has worked for federal \ncontractors since July 2002. He served in the submarine service of the U.S. Navy for \nabout 15 years and retired as a chief petty officer (Tr. 29, 31).  \n \n \nApplicant was married in November 1984. He is a high school graduate with two \nyears of college but no degree (Tr. 10). He and his wife have two sons, ages 19 and 17 \n(Tr. 30).  \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since July 1989. He received a Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) clearance in February 2005, but it was revoked in \nDecember 2005 because of security concerns under Guidelines M and E. \n \nBetween the fall of 2003 and August 2004, while working for a federal contractor, \nApplicant engaged in sexually graphic conversations on a government computer during \nduty hours, two to four hours a week, for up to an hour on each occasion. The \nconversations involved descriptions of sexual acts and physical descriptions of \nparticipants. He stored nude photographs of himself on his home computer, loaded \nthem on a disk, transferred them to his government computer, and shared them with \nothers by instant messaging while at work. He estimated he sent nude photographs of \nhimself 10 to 15 times, and he received nude photographs from others about the same \nnumber of times (Tr. 42). Applicant\u2019s photographs did not show his face but depicted his \ngenitalia (Tr. 45). His sexual activities involved only adult females (Tr. 57).  \n \nApplicant told a security investigator and he testified at the hearing that he \nparticipated in the sexually-oriented activities because he was bored and frustrated. He \nworked as a consultant for a manager who regarded him as a hindrance, he was not \ninvolved in the day-to-day activities of the office, and his work station was in an isolated \nlocation (Tr. 45). He could not explain why he resorted to sexual activity to alleviate his \nboredom and frustration instead of other activities such as playing games or watching \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmovies (Tr. 55). His sexual activity ended when he was transferred to another job site \non a different contract (GX 2 at 3; GX 3). He destroyed the nude photographs of himself \nand the disks on which they were stored (Tr. 44). \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator on March 1, 2007, Applicant \nadmitted that he consorted with prostitutes about once a month from 1985 to 1989. At \nthe time, he was married and on active duty as a petty officer first class in the Navy (GX \n2 at 4). At the hearing he admitted he also visited massage parlors that offered sexual \ngratification about once every other month from 1998 to 2001 (Tr. 48-49). He attributed \nhis behavior to youthful rebelliousness (Tr. 56). \n \nApplicant testified he has not visited a prostitute for 19 years, but he recanted \nthis statement when confronted with evidence that he visited massage parlors for sexual \ngratification until 2001. He testified he stopped his sexual activities on the internet in \n2004. He removed the instant messaging software from his personal and work \ncomputers (Tr. 28). He admitted he knew his participation in the sexually-oriented \nactivity on his government computer was prohibited (Tr. 41).  \n \n \nApplicant testified his wife and sons are unaware of his involvement with \nprostitutes and his sexual activities on the internet (Tr. 54, 58). He did not disclose his \nactivities to his wife because he did not want to hurt her (Tr. 54). He believes disclosure \nof his activities to his wife could cost him his marriage (Tr. 57).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant engaged in graphic, sexually inappropriate instant \nmessaging on a government computer during work hours from 2003 to August 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); stored nude photographs of himself on his home computer, transferred \nthem onto a disk, loaded the disk onto his work computer, and sent them to others \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b); received nude photographs on his government computer (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and \nvisited prostitutes from about 1985 to 1989 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). It also alleges his spouse has \nno knowledge of his computer sexual activities or his involvement with prostitutes (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e). Finally, it alleges his SCI access was revoked in December 2005 for misuse of \ninformation technology systems and personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n \nDepartment Counsel introduced evidence that Applicant frequented massage \nparlors offering sexual activity from 1998 to 2001. This conduct was not alleged in the \nSOR. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered: A(a) to assess an applicant=s \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncredibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis.\u201d ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have limited my consideration \nof the conduct not alleged in the SOR to assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, determining \nwhether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation, and in my whole person \nanalysis.  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is, \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information.\u201d AG \u00b6 15. Three potentially disqualifying conditions are relevant. \nFirst, the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(c) applies to: \n[C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information.  \nSecond, the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(d) applies to:  \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations [and] . . . evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nFinally, the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(e) applies to: \n[P]ersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s use of his government computer during duty hours to engage in \nsexually explicit activity raises all three disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to \nhim to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 \n\n \n6 \n \n \nE3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense \nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). The \nfirst prong is arguably met. Applicant\u2019s individual acts were either civil misdemeanors or \ninfractions of rules imposed by the government or his employer.  \n \n \nThe second prong of this mitigating condition focuses on the recentness of the \nconduct. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. See \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \nApplicant\u2019s last misconduct was in August 2004, more than four years ago. In \nitself, this four-year period is \u201ca significant period of time.\u201d It stopped when Applicant\u2019s \njob location changed. Applicant\u2019s conduct spanned a 19-year period ending in 2004, \nduring which he was married to his current wife. His justification for consorting with \nprostitutes was his youthful rebelliousness. His justification for misuse of his \ngovernment computer while he was in his mid-40s was boredom and frustration. His \nchoice of activities to relieve his boredom and frustration reflects poorly on his \njudgment. His misuse of his government computer went far beyond passive \nparticipation. He photographed himself at home, copies the photos onto a disk, took the \ndisk to work, loaded the photographs of his genitalia on his government computer, and \nsent them to others. Notwithstanding his declared intention to avoid similar misconduct \nin the future, I am not convinced that his inappropriate conduct will not recur if he finds \nhimself in another boring, frustrating, and physically isolated duty assignment. \nApplicant was not completely candid at the hearing. At the hearing, he asserted \nthat his involvements with prostitutes ended in 1989, but he recanted this statement \nwhen confronted with evidence that he frequented massage parlors offering sexual \ngratification as late as 2001. In light of his long history of flouting the rules and \nconcealing his behavior, I am not persuaded that he is rehabilitated.  \nThe remaining prongs of AG 17(c) are not established. His behavior was \nfrequent, did not occur under unusual circumstances, and it casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if an applicant \n\u201chas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant acknowledged his behavior at the hearing. He \nhas not received any counseling or treatment (Tr. 52). He testified he realizes he should \nhave asked his supervisors to transfer him when his job became boring and frustrating, \nbut there is little evidence that he has taken any positive steps to protect himself from \nfuture inappropriate reactions to boring or frustrating work. Applicant has not carried his \nburden of establishing this mitigating condition. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant\u2019s employer is aware of his conduct, and \nit cost him his SCI clearance. Applicant remains vulnerable, however, because his wife \nand teenaged sons are unaware of his conduct. He admitted at the hearing that \ndisclosure to his family could cost him his marriage. This mitigating condition is not \nestablished. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c under this \nguideline. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39 as follows:  \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other \ninformation technology system.\u201d AG \u00b6 40(e). \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 41(a). For the reasons set out above \nin the discussion of AG \u00b6 17(c) under Guideline E, I conclude this mitigating condition is \nnot established. No other enumerated mitigating conditions are applicable.  \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n The SOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.d under this \nguideline. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12 as follows: \n\u201cSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional \ndisorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may subject the individual to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nundue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201csexual behavior \nof a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d AG \u00b6 13(a). \nDepartment Counsel produced no evidence that the conduct alleged in the SOR was a \ncrime. Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 13(a) is not raised.  \nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201csexual behavior that causes an \nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress\u201d or \u201csexual behavior of a \npublic nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and (d). \nThese two disqualifying conditions are raised. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe sexual behavior \nhappened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(b). For the reasons set out above in the \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 17(c) under Guideline E, this mitigating condition is not established. \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201c(c) the behavior no longer serves as \na basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(c). Applicant has not disclosed his \nconduct to his family, and he is concerned that it could destroy his marriage if it is \ndisclosed to his wife. This mitigating condition is not established. No other enumerated \nmitigating conditions are applicable.   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, M, and D in my whole person analysis. Some of the \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under these guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, obviously intelligent man. He engaged in repeated \ninappropriate sexual behavior from shortly after his marriage until his mid-40s. He has a \nhistory of poor judgment and concealment of his behavior. He was remorseful and \nembarrassed at the hearing, but not fully candid about the extent of his sexual activity. \nHe is deeply concerned about the impact of disclosure on his marriage and his family, \nmaking him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. The likelihood of \nrecurrence is difficult to assess, because he has not sought counseling or treatment, \ncould not explain why he sought sexual gratification as a remedy for boredom and \nfrustration, and has not been placed in a work situation similar to his situation in 2003 \nand 2004.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, M, \nand D, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on his personal conduct, \nmisuse of information technology systems, and sexual behavior. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M (Use of Information  \nTechnology Systems): \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on March 11, 2008.  On December 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns for financial considerations under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nJanuary 6, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 3, 3009.  He admitted seven \nand denied ten of 17 allegations.  He provided detailed information concerning his \nfinancial situation and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 17, 2009.  The case was assigned to me \non February 23, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 24, 2009, for a \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing on March 20, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government \noffered nine exhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 9.  Applicant \nobjected to five of the exhibits.  All exhibits were admitted as noted below.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf.  Applicant submitted 15 exhibits marked Applicant Exhibits \n(App. Ex.) A through O, which were admitted without objection.  The record was kept \nopen for Applicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted 12 \nadditional documents marked App. Ex. P though AA.  Government Counsel did not \nhave any objections to the documents (Gov. Ex. 10), and they were admitted into the \nrecord.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 30, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nApplicant objected to Gov. Ex. 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 as not relevant since they were \nold documents and there are current documents.  Gov. Ex. 1 is a security clearance \napplication, dated October 14, 2004; Gov. Ex. 2 is Applicant's statement dated February \n6, 2002; Gov. Ex. 3 is bankruptcy proceedings documents from May through December \n1997; Gov. Ex. 6 is a credit report dated March 18, 2005; and Gov. Ex. 7 is a credit \nreport dated December 1, 2006.  The Government also introduced Applicant's recent \nanswers to Interrogatories (Gov. Ex. 4 and 5), and credit reports of July 10, 2008 (Gov. \nEx. 8), and October 28, 2008 (Gov. Ex. 9).  Applicant introduced his most recent \nsecurity clearance application, dated March 11, 2008 (App. Ex. M).  Applicant's \nobjections were overruled and the government exhibits were admitted as being \nauthentic and relevant and material to a determination of Applicant's security worthiness \n(Tr. 14-22).   \n \nThe Government's motion to withdraw SOR allegation 1.g to conform to the \nevidence was granted (Tr. 80).  There was also a typographical error on SOR allegation \n1.g which was corrected to read $1,155 (Tr. 12-13). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old college graduate who has worked for about a year as a \nsystems engineer with his present defense contractor employer.  He has been working \nfor various defense contractors for about five years.  He was married in 1981 but he and \nhis wife separated in 1997.  Their divorce was final in 2004.  He has two grown children.  \nApplicant has prior service on active duty in the Air Force (App. Ex. N, DD 214, dated \nOctober 15, 1992), and service in the Air National Guard (Tr. 10-11, App. Ex. O, e-QIP, \ndated March 11, 2008).  Applicant completed a personal financial statement in \nSeptember 2008 listing net monthly income of $5,195 with monthly recurring expenses \nof $2,783 leaving a monthly discretionary remainder of $2,412.  He also listed savings \nof $1,500 and a $500 retirement account (Gov. Ex. 4, Answer to Interrogatories, dated \nSeptember 4, 2008).  Applicant updated the information at the hearing and provided a \nnew Personal Financial Statement.  He lists savings of $3,500, and a retirement \naccount of $1,100 (App. Ex. C, Bank Statement, dated March 20, 2009; App. Ex. D, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAccount Statement, dated March 9, 2009; App. Ex. E, Retirement Account statement, \ndated March 31, 2009).  His monthly updated net salary is now $6,643 with $3,103 in \nmonthly expenses leaving his disposable income at about $3,000 monthly (Tr. 74-76, \nApp. Ex. A, Personal Financial Statement, dated March 20, 2009; App. Ex. B, Earnings \nstatement, dated March 5, 2009).   \n \nThe SOR lists 17 allegations of financial considerations security concern.  These \ninclude a medical debt in collection for $148 (SOR 1.a); a charged off credit card debt to \na bank for $617 (SOR 1.b); a clothing store account past due more than 90 days for \n$1,520 (SOR 1.c); a department store account charged off for $2,567 (SOR 1.d); a \njewelry store account charged off of $973 (SOR 1.e); student loans charged off for \n$18,834 (SOR 1.f); a medical debt in collection for $1,155 (SOR 1.g); a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy filed on May 20, 1997 with debts discharged on September 10, 1997 (SOR \n1.h); a medical debt in collection for $66 (SOR 1.i); a delinquent phone debt in collection \nfor $1,139 (SOR 1.j); two delinquent debts for the same creditor in collection for $847 \nand $1,859 (SOR 1.k, and 1.l); a cable debt in collection for $119 (SOR 1.m); a credit \ncard debt charged off for $1,780 (SOR 1.n); child support payments in collection for \n$61,000 (SOR 1.o); a credit card debt charged off for $1,972 (SOR 1.p); and a \ntelephone debt charged off for $1,394 (SOR 1.q).  The total amount of the debt is about \n$96,000, the majority which is student loans of $18,834, and child support of $61,000 \n(Tr. 10-12; See, Gov. Ex. 3, Bankruptcy documents, dated May 19, 1997; Gov. Ex. 4 \nand 5, Answers to Interrogatories, dated September 4, 2008, and October 25, 3008, \nand Gov. Ex. 6, 7, 8, and 9, Credit Reports, dated March 2005, December 2006, July \n2008, and October 2008).   \n \nApplicant and his wife had significant debt and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nApril 1997.  Their debts were discharged in December 1997.  Shortly after filing the \nbankruptcy petition, Applicant's wife left him.  Applicant worked for the local school \ndistrict as a teacher and software evaluator from August 1997 until February 2001.  He \nleft that position because of complaints by his wife to his employer.  He was briefly \nemployed by a local university from April 2001 until November 2001.  He served in the \nAir National Guard as a drilling reservist from November 1999 until June 2002.  He was \non full time duty with the Air National Guard from November 2001 until July 2002.  He \nwas unemployed from July 2002 until he worked at a Wal-Mart store from June to \nAugust 2003 for $8 an hour.  He then worked for an attorney friend at the same rate of \npay from August 2003 until January 2004.  Since then he has been employed by \nvarious defense contractors (Tr. 35-39; App. Ex. M, e-QIP, dated March 11, 2008). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR allegation 1.a is a medical debt.  Applicant does not know \nwhat the debt is for.  He has not made any inquires about the debt because of the lack \nof information on the debt in the credit reports (Tr. 33-34, 61).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR allegation 1.b is a credit card debt of $617.  Applicant \nacknowledges the amount of the debt as $358.63 when he made his last payment in \nJune 2002.  Applicant has not made further payments on the debt and states it will soon \nbe removed from his credit report as barred by the statute of limitations.  He does not \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbelieve it is still a valid debt because legally the creditor cannot seek restitution (Tr. 34-\n35, 61-63; App. Ex. Q, Bank Statements, dated July 3, 2002, and August 3, 2002). \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.c and 1.d are credit card debts.  The debts were \nincurred by Applicant's girlfriend who shared living arrangements and expenses.  The \ncards and the bills are in the name of his girlfriend.  Applicant may also have used the \ncards since he is an authorized user and had these cards in his possession.  He made \npayments on the cards until he and the girlfriend separated.  Applicant states these are \nthe girlfriend's debts and not his debts and he has \"no obligation to repay, absolutely \nnot\" (Tr. 40-41, 63-66; App. Ex. R, Statement, dated September 5, 2007; App. Ex. S, \nStatement, dated September 3, 2007).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.e is an account charged off in 2002 by a jewelry store.  \nApplicant acknowledged he was the user of the card.  He has not made any payments \non the card since 2002.  This account has not been paid (Tr. 41-42, 66; App. Ex. T, \nStatement, dated July 28, 2002) \n \nDelinquent debt 1.f is for student loans incurred by Applicant when he was \nfurthering his education.  Applicant had the student loans incorporated into one federal \nloan of approximately $32,969.  He has a payment plan for the loans and is current with \nhis monthly payment of $194 (Tr. 32-43, 66-67; App. Ex. F, Account Statement, dated \nApril 19, 2007; Federal Student Aid Account, dated March 20, 2009).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.g was withdrawn by the government.  SOR 1.h is the \nbankruptcy action initiated by Applicant and his former wife in May 1997 with debts \ndischarged in December 1997.  The amount of debt discharged was approximately \n$40,000.  The debts accumulated because of only part-time work and full-time college, \nas well as excess spending.  Applicant claims the majority of the debts were incurred by \nhis former wife's excess spending using about seven credit cards (Tr. 44-47). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.i is a medical account in collection for $66.  Applicant \nbelieves the medical treatment was for him in 2006.  The entire bill was for $150.60 and \nwas paid in three installments by check.  He does not have copies of his checks, but the \ncreditor acknowledged payment in full (Tr. 47-48, 67; App. Ex. U, Paid in full letter, \ndated April 9, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.j was a bill of $1,139 for a house phone.  Delinquent \ndebt 1.q was a cell phone from another provider for $1,394 on a different phone.  The \nphones were used by Applicant, his former wife, and other family members.  Applicant \ndisputed the debts on-line with the credit reporting agencies as not his debts.  However, \nthe bills are in his name.  He has not heard from them about the dispute (Tr. 49-50, 67-\n70; App. Ex. V, Bill, dated August 16, 2000; App. Ex. Z, Statement, dated February 14, \n2001; App. Ex. AA, Statement, dated March 23, 2001). \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.k for $847, and 1.l for $1,859 were for two credit cards \nused by Applicant after he and his wife separated.  SOR 1.p is the same debt as SOR \n\n \n5 \n \n \n1.l.  The credit cards were used in mid 2001 when Applicant was employed by a \nuniversity driving three hours round trip to work.  He was earning about $35,000 per \nyear and had monthly child support payments of approximately $1447.  He did not have \nsufficient funds to pay the debts owed.  He has not made any payments on these cards \nsince 2002 (Tr. 50-51, 70-71; App. Ex. W, Statement, dated June 18, 2001; App. Ex. Y, \nStatement, dated June 11, 2001).  \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.m for $119 is for cable service.  Applicant disputed this \naccount but never heard from the creditor or the collection agency.  He does not have a \ncopy of the letter sent concerning the dispute.  He has not made any payments on the \naccount (Tr. 51, 71).  \n \n Delinquent debt SOR 1.n is another credit card of $1,780 incurred by Applicant \nafter separating from his former wife.  He was unable to pay the debt and still has not \nmade any payments on the debt (Tr. 51-52, 71-72; App. Ex. X, Statement, dated May \n15, 2001).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.o is for child and spousal support payment arrearages of \napproximately $61,000.  In 2002, Applicant was ordered to pay approximately $1,400 \nmonthly in spousal and child support.  He was unable to make payments so he \naccumulated support arrears.  When he went to work for defense contractors in 2004, \nhis pay was initially garnished to pay the support due but not arrears.  After changing \nemployers, the garnishment stopped.  Applicant made some payments towards the \narrears using income tax refunds.  He intends to apply this year's tax refund to the \nsupport arrears.  Applicant claims over the last few years he paid between $15,000 and \n$20,000 in support.  He pays the current child support but still has significant arrearage \n(Tr.  52-60, 72-73). \n \nApplicant has three credit cards that are current.  Two are active cards (App. Ex. \nH, Statement, dated March 4, 2009; App. Ex. I, Statement, dated March 13, 2009).  One \ncard has been closed but still has a balance of $321 that is being paid (Tr. 26-29; App. \nEx. J. Statement, dated February 20, 2009).  Applicant also has a credit union loan that \nhe is current on payments (Tr. 29-30; App. Ex. K, Statement, dated April 20, 2009).  His \ncredit union account also shows a positive balance and positive cash flow (Tr. 30; App. \nEx. L, Statement, dated March 8, 2009).  He has a contract to purchase the house he is \nnow renting (Tr. 30; App. Ex. M, Contract, undated). \n   \nApplicant states that not counting his child support arrears, he owes about \n$7,000.  He has not made any payments towards these debts.  Most of the creditors for \nthese debts will be prevented by the statute of limitations from collection on the debts.  \nHe has debt issues because of the period of his life from 1997 to 2004 when he and his \nformer wife were divorcing.  He moved so he could start his life over and leave the past \nbehind him.  He made a conscious decision not to pay the debts based on advice of an \nattorney and a friend who is also an attorney.  They advised him to not pay the debts \nbecause the creditors would soon be barred by the statute of limitations from collecting \nthe debts.  If he made payments, the time for debt payment would start running again.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nHe has focused his effort on maintaining a good credit score.  He was able to purchase \na house but it took a long time from May 2007 until December 2008 (Tr. 76-79; See, \nApp. Ex. P, Applicant's post hearing statement, dated April 9, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The credit reports and Applicant's admissions show that Applicant has \ndelinquent debts that have not been resolved, addressed, paid, or otherwise settled.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are a security concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations.)  Applicant and his former \nwife had their debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1997.  While the bankruptcy action was \nproceeding, his wife left him.  Applicant accumulated delinquent debts from about 2000 \nto 2003 when he incurred credit card, medical, student loan, and child and spousal \nsupport debt. \n \n \nThe bankruptcy discharge itself is not a security concern since bankruptcy is a \nlegal and permissible means of resolving debts.  The bankruptcy discharge released \nhim of the burden of paying the debts that arose during his marriage.  However, the \ndebts that arose after the bankruptcy discharge should be examined to determine \nfinancial responsibility and the impact on security worthiness.  After the bankruptcy \ndischarge, Applicant continued to accumulate significant delinquent debts.  The debts \nhe accumulated after the bankruptcy do create a financial consideration security \nconcern and raise the disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  Applicant is paying or has paid \nsome of his debts so these debts are not current delinquent debts (SOR 1.f, 1.i)  He is \nmaking his current child support payments and has made some periodic payments on \nthe arrears for support (SOR 1.o).  Applicant presented no information to establish that \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhe is now or has made any payments on ten of the delinquent debts (SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, \n1.e, 1.j, `1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.q).  Applicant does claim that some of these debts are not \nhis but his girlfriend's.  Since he admits to having used the credit cards leading to the \ndebts at some time, they are considered his debts also (SOR 1.c, 1.d).  He also claims \nhe disputes some of the debts but he has not followed up with creditors about the debts \n(SOR 1.j, 1. m).  Since these debts have not been paid, they are current debts.  There \nare a number of delinquent debts from various sources such as credit cards, telephone \nbills, and medical bills indicating that Applicant accumulates delinquent debts frequently.  \nApplicant claims he was unable to pay the debts because of his divorce and periods of \nunemployment or under employment.  He admits that the debts he is not paying amount \nto about $7,000.  Applicant has been gainfully employed for almost five years and has \nnot established that he cannot repay these debts.  He did establish that he decided not \nto pay the debts since the creditors will be barred by the statute of limitations from \nenforcing the debts.  These unpaid debts cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  This mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) has some application to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation.  Applicant's divorce and periods of underemployment and unemployment had \nan impact on his finances so that he accumulated delinquent debts.  However, he has \nbeen gainfully employed for over five years.  His current debts are being paid as agreed \nand he has a positive cash flow, but he has not made any payments on his delinquent \ndebts.  While Applicant's divorce and employment situation in the early 2001 era may \nhave caused some debt, he has not been prevented from paying something on his \ndelinquent debts since 2004.  He did not act responsibly under the circumstances so the \nmitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there is clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  There is no evidence Applicant sought or received counseling \nfor his financial issues.  He may have had some counseling when he filed bankruptcy \nbut that was early in the process.  He indicated he spoke with an attorney who advised \nto wait for the statute of limitations to run.  Other than this advice, there is no indication \nthat he received any financial counseling.  This mitigating condition does not apply. \n  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.  Applicant had the means and ability to make some payments on his delinquent \ndebts, but he has not paid any of the debts or made any plans to pay the debts.  He \nstated his intentions not to pay the debts but wait for the statute of limitations on the \ndebts to run.  He does not have a systematic concrete plan of debt payment or \nreduction.  An applicant is not required to be debt free, but he is required to act \n\n \n9 \n \n \nresponsibly in regard to his debts.   Applicant's payment of current financial obligations \nbut refusal to pay past delinquent debts and wait for the running of the statute of \nlimitations is not a good-faith effort to pay debts or an indication of acting responsibly \ntowards the debts.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate \nsecurity concerns for financial considerations. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant underwent a \nbitter and protracted divorce proceeding and then had periods of underemployment or \nunemployment.  I considered his service in the Air Force and Air National Guard.  I \nconsidered that his current debts are paid as agreed and that he has a positive cash \nflow and savings accounts.  I considered he is current with his student loan payments \nand is making his current support payments.  However, Applicant accumulated \ndelinquent debts in the past that he now refuses to pay.  It is not unusual that he \naccumulated delinquent debt from a divorce and periods of underemployment and \nunemployment.  But after three years of accumulating debt, he started steady and \nlucrative employment in the defense industry.  He has refused to pay about $7,000 in \ndelinquent debts accumulated before becoming gainfully employed.  He now has the \nability to repay his debts but refuses to do so letting the statute of limitations run so the \ncreditors are unable to enforce their debts.  Applicant has the financial means to make \npayments but has not done so.  He has been irresponsible toward his finances by \nrefusing to pay delinquent debt when capable of doing so.  This irresponsible financial \nconduct indicates Applicant may be irresponsible in managing classified information.  \nOn balance, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from financial considerations.   \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate of 1.l) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Position (SF 86) on April 1, \n2008 (Item 5).  On January 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns \nfor financial considerations under Guideline F and personal conduct under Guideline E \n(Item 1).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 19, 2009, admitting all of the \nallegations in the SOR with some explanation (Item 4).  He elected to have the matter \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on March 17, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of \nrelevant material (FORM) on March 25, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file \nobjections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM or provide \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadditional material.  The case was assigned to me on June 16, 2009.  Based on a \nreview of the case file and pleadings, eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI thoroughly reviewed the case file, and the pleadings.  I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and an analyst for a defense contractor.  He is divorced \nwith one child for whom he pays child support.  He attended college for approximately \nthree years but did not earn a degree.  He served seven years on active duty in the \nArmy (Item 5).   He lists his current monthly net income as $2,843.08 with monthly \nexpenses of $2,705.  His monthly net remainder is $138 (Item 6 at 16).  Applicant to the \nbest of his knowledge has not incurred delinquent debt in seven years.  He feels he is \nbarely living within his means at this time (Item 6 at 7). \n \nCredit reports, Applicant's admissions, and the SOR list the following delinquent \ndebts: a credit card account debt of $1,263 past due since August 2001 (SOR 1.a); a \ndebt in collection to a property management company of $1,100 (SOR 1.b); a student \nloan debt in collection with the Department of Education for $8,472 (SOR 1.c); a \ncollection account for another  property management company for $10,134 (SOR 1.d); \nand a collection account for a cell phone for $1,072 (SOR 1.e; See Item 6, Answer to \nInterrogatories, dated September 23, 2008, Item 6, Credit Report, dated April 1, 2008; \nand Item 8, Credit Report, dated November 19, 2008).  The delinquent debts total \n$22,040. \n \nApplicant's financial problems started when he attended college from 1994 to \n1997.  He obtained credit cards and opened student loans.  He did not understand how \ncredit worked and he was financially irresponsible.  He got behind on his payments.  He \ndid not receive financial guidance or assistance from his family.  He joined the Army in \nAugust 1997.  He purchased a truck and again got behind on payments.  He did not \nunderstand finances and he and his wife incurred expenses they could not meet.  They \npaid what bills they could when they could.  His wife did not work steadily particularly \nafter their child was born (Item 6 at 5-6).   \n \nApplicant admitted the debts listed in the SOR.  Applicant admits the debt at \nSOR 1.a for a credit card he opened while in college.  He has not made payments on \nthis account for a number of years and does not plan to make payments since he does \nnot have the means to make payments (Item 6 at 4). \n \nApplicant admits the debt to a property management company at SOR 1.b.  He \nleft an apartment he rented from the company damaged and dirty.  He tried to settle \nwith the company but was not successful.  He has not contacted the company in a few \nyears to settle the account (Item 6 at 4). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admits he owes the Department of Education for student loans as listed \nat SOR 1.c.  The initial debt was for $10,869.  His tax return was used to pay $1,800.  \nHe would like to get it settled and paid in five years, but he did not provide specific plans \nfor payment (Item 6 at 4).  \n \nApplicant admitted that he left another apartment he rented damaged and dirty \nbut disputed the amount owed the property management company (SOR 1.d).  He \nbelieves the damage was minor and should have been taken from his $600 security \ndeposit.  He tried to negotiate the amount of damage with the property management \ncompany but they insisted the damage was significant.  He would like to settle the \naccount for approximately $2,000.  He has not followed up with the property \nmanagement company nor had contact with them in a number of years (Item 6 at 3). \n \nApplicant admits the cell phone debt in collection for $1,072 at SOR 1.e.  He \nstopped making payments on the account when he left the Army and moved.  This \naccount was not one of his priorities when he moved.  Applicant plans to contact the \ncreditor and settle the account and pay the creditor $100 monthly (Item 6 at 4-5). \n \nApplicant admits that the omission of delinquent debts on his security clearance \napplication was intentional.  He generally knew of his debt listed in the credit bureau \nreports at the time he completed his security clearance application but did not know the \nspecific details.  He did not believe it was important to list his debts.  He had adequate \ntime to research the information and complete the form.  He did not ask his security \nmanager or supervisor for guidance in completing the forms (Item 6 at 7).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts as established by credit reports and his \nadmissions raise Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations).  The record from credit reports and responses to \ninterrogatories shows his inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and shows a history \nof not meeting financial obligations. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  Applicant has taken no action to \npay the delinquent debts, so the debts are current.  The debts are from various sources, \ncredit cards, delinquent debts to two property management companies, student loans, \nand a phone bill, so the debts are not infrequent.  Since the debts are current and not \npaid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  The mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant admits to financial \nproblems in college and his wife's inability to find steady employment as reasons for his \nfinancial problems.  However, Applicant was on active duty in the Army for over seven \nyears.  Since then the only period of unemployment seems to be shortly after he left \nactive duty.  He presented no information concerning any attempt to pay past due \nobligations since he has been employed.  He has not established he acted responsibly \nin managing his finances and making payments on his obligations. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\".  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant presented no information to show he has a plan to pay the debts or any action \nthat he has taken to pay his debts.  Applicant appears to have sufficient income to make \nsome payments on his delinquent debts since he has been steadily employed for almost \ntwelve years.  He has not presented a concrete plan to pay his delinquent debts or \nestablished any attempt to pay them.  He has not presented sufficient information to \nindicate a good-faith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts.  Even though he states he \nhas not incurred delinquent debt in seven years, he has not established that his \nfinances are under control and he acted responsibly towards his delinquent debts.  He \nhas not presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for financial \nconsiderations. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning debts past due more than 180 days or 90 \ndays raise a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \nAG \u00b6 16(a) \"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness.\" \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately failed to answer financial questions \ncorrectly and accurately on his April 1, 2008 security clearance application.  While there \nis a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in \nany written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security \nclearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  \nA falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and \nwillfully.  Applicant admits that he knowingly and willfully provided false financial \ninformation on his security clearance application.  I find none of the Personal Conduct \nMitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 17 apply.  I find against Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken sufficient action to resolve his past due debts.  His \nindifferent attitude and lack of action show he does not exercise good judgment, and is \nnot trustworthy or responsible.  Applicant has been irresponsible towards his delinquent \ndebts and financial obligations.  This is an indication that he might be irresponsible \ntowards the protection and handling of classified information.  He also deliberately \nprovided incomplete and false information on a security clearance application.  This \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncourse of conduct indicates he may not be truthful and careful in protecting classified \ninformation.  Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances \nand personal conduct.

Mills, Esquire\nAugust 30, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), on\nApril 11, 2006. (Government Exhibit 1.) On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior), E (Personal Conduct), J\n(Criminal Conduct), and F (Financial Considerations) concerning Applicant. The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR in writing on April 4, 2009, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to\n\n2\nproceed on April 21, 2009. This case was assigned to me on May 12, 2009.  DOHA\nissued the first notice of hearing on May 27, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on August 5, 2009, and November 23, 2009. The Government offered\nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through W, which were\nalso received without objection. DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing, and\nthe record closed, on December 3, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 48 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Applicant\nadmitted subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 4.a., 4.b., and 4.c. of the Statement of Reasons.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. He denied subparagraphs 2.a.\nand 3.a. He also submitted additional information in support of his request for a security\nclearance.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct, which is related to his sexual\nbehavior.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because his criminal conduct, and related sexual behavior, shows poor\njudgment, irresponsibility or untrustworthiness.\nIn addition to his job in the defense industry, Applicant also is a professional\nphotographer. In August 2003 Applicant was involved in an incident where he took\nsemi-nude pictures of a 14 year old girl. Applicant has consistently stated that the\nincident was accidental. (Answer; Government Exhibit 2; Transcript at 45-49.)\nPolice were eventually informed of the event and, in May 2004, Applicant was\narrested. He was eventually charged with, and plead guilty to, the misdemeanor\noffense, Annoying or Molesting Children, in September 2004. He was sentenced to\nserve 30 days in jail, three years probation, fined $800 and required to register as a sex\n\n3\noffender. This guilty plea was at the recommendation of the Applicant\u2019s then-attorney.\n(Government Exhibits 2, 3 and 4; Transcript at 46-47, 55-57.)\nSoon after his conviction, Applicant fired his first attorney and began fighting to\nhave his conviction overturned. His second attorney was also replaced and Applicant\nhas been represented by his current counsel for the duration of the case before DOHA.\nAfter many court hearings, the Applicant served 21 days in jail in 2008. (Applicant\nExhibits B, C and D.) He successfully served his probation. Pursuant to motion,\nApplicant\u2019s guilty plea was expunged on November 13, 2009. (Applicant Exhibit A.) The\nstate court hearing to remove the Applicant\u2019s name from the sexual offender database\noccurred after the hearing was held in this case. (Transcript at 58-60.)\nParagraph 4 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAs stated above, Applicant has been involved in a long and costly legal fight\nsince 2003. In addition, from 2003 to 2006. Applicant and his wife were co-owners of a\nsmall business. Due to a business downturn, the business failed. Applicant and his wife\nbecame personally liable for the business debts, which are the basis for the three\nallegations in this paragraph. Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable, and he is\nable to pay his current indebtedness, resolve his delinquent debts, and maintain savings\nfor the future. (Applicant Exhibit Q.)\n4.a.\nApplicant admits that he was indebted to a loan company in the amount of\n$10,133. Applicant made an agreement with the successor creditor to pay $375 per\nmonth starting in February 2009. The payments have been made in a consistent fashion\nand, as of November 23, 2010, the debt had been reduced to $5,454. (Government\nExhibit 8; Applicant Exhibits S and W; Transcript at 49-51.)\n4.b.\nApplicant admits that he was indebted to a bank in the amount of $3,455\nfor a delinquent credit card. Applicant made arrangements to pay this debt off at the rate\nof $150 a month commencing in August 2008. This debt was paid in full as of October\n2009. (Government Exhibit 8; Applicant Exhibit R; Transcript at 51-52.)\n4.c.\nApplicant admits being indebted to a department store in the amount of\n$2,204 for a delinquent account. Applicant made arrangements to pay this debt off at\nthe rate of $105.66 a month commencing in April 2009. These payments have been\nmade in a consistent fashion and, as of November 23, 2010, the debt had been reduced\nto $796. (Government Exhibit 8; Applicant Exhibit T; Transcript at 52.)\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a letter of support from his wife. (Applicant Exhibit F.) In that\nletter, she discusses her understanding of the Applicant\u2019s criminal case, as well as how\n\n4\nshe was involved in the business which, after it went under, left them with several debts.\nApplicant\u2019s step-daughter and her boyfriend also submitted letters of support. (Applicant\nExhibits G and H.) They say that he is a trustworthy and respectable man.\nSeveral co-workers and friends also submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.\n(Applicant Exhibits I, J, K, L, M and N.) He is described as professional, enthusiastic\nand dedicated. All indicate that they have knowledge of the criminal allegations against\nthe Applicant, believe in him, and recommend him for a position of trust. \nApplicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly respected\nemployee.  (Applicant Exhibits O and P.) Evidence was also submitted showing that the\nApplicant kept his employer fully and promptly informed of the proceedings in this case.\n(Applicant Exhibit E.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision. In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG\n\u00b6 12:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse\ninference concerning the standards of this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n6\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe Applicant was involved in a single act of taking a photograph of a 14 year old\ngirl partially disrobed, which resulted in the Applicant being arrested, and convicted of a\nmisdemeanor. AG \u00b6 31(a) under Guideline J applies to this case, stating that a\ndisqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nTwo of the mitigating conditions also apply and have been considered.  They are\nAG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG \u00b6\n32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d \nThe Applicant\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct occurred over four years before the\nrecord closed. His probation has been terminated and the conviction expunged. Without\nminimizing the Applicant\u2019s culpability, the conduct is mitigated by the passage of time\nand the favorable recommendations of his family, friends and co-workers, which\nindicate he is rehabilitated and the concerns raised are no longer an issue.\nTurning to Guideline D, I find that one of the disqualifying conditions applies to\nthis case. Specifically, AG \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not\nthe individual has been prosecuted.\u201d\nI have examined the mitigating conditions and find that several apply. AG \u00b6 14(b)\nstates it may be mitigating when \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so\ninfrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nIn addition, AG \u00b6 14(c) applies, \u201cthe behavior no long serves as a basis for coercion,\nexploitation or duress.\u201d My Guideline J analysis applies to this Guideline as well. The\nApplicant has kept his employer, and through them the Government, fully informed of\nthe progress in his case. In addition, family, friends and the community at large know\nabout his criminal conviction and the reason behind it.\nFinally, concerning the Personal Conduct allegation, Paragraph 3. AG \u00b6 16 sets\nforth potentially disqualifying conditions, none of which are independently supported by\nthis record. However, to the extent that Appellant\u2019s sexual misconduct and criminal\noffense involved questionable judgment, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, they can also be considered to support security concerns under AG \u00b6 15.\nAs discussed above, Applicant\u2019s sexual and criminal conduct arguably involves\nquestionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with criminal laws.\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns. For the same reasons that the equivalent mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines J and D were established, as discussed above, Applicant demonstrated\nmitigation under one Guideline E mitigating condition, \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress.\u201d\nBased on all of the evidence presented, Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns of his single misdemeanor conviction of Annoy/Molest Child, and the factual\ncircumstances behind it. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 are found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 4 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, had approximately $15,000 in past-due debts, which have been due and\nowing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(b)\nstates that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Finally,\nAG \u00b6 20(d) states it is mitigating where \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant=s financial difficulties\narose in about 2006, in relation to his criminal case, and the failure of a family owned\nsmall business. Both of those situations have been resolved. He has paid, or is paying,\nall of the three past due debts and his current financial situation is stable. These\nmitigating conditions apply to this case. Paragraph 4 is found for the Applicant.\n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct,\ninvolving an underage girl, occurred over four years ago. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3),\nApplicant\u2019s conduct is not recent. Based on the state of the record, and as discussed in\ndepth above, I find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6). This is in regards to the allegation of criminal conduct, with the related\nallegations of sexual behavior and personal conduct; and his ability to handle his\nfinancial affairs. Accordingly, at the present time, I find that there is no potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is no likelihood\nof recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nconduct, sexual behavior, personal conduct, and financial considerations. The evidence\nsupports his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, Paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 are\nfound for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 4.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 4.c:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations, Personal Conduct, and \nCriminal Conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nOn March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations; Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline J, Criminal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2009, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 8, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 10, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 7, 2009. The \nAugust 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n12. GE 1 through 11 were admitted without objection. GE 12 was admitted over \nApplicant\u2019s objection. The Government originally requested administrative notice of GE \n13, but withdrew its request. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A and B, which were received without objection. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted five pages of documents, \nwhich were marked AE C through F, and admitted without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s memorandum is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2001. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 to 2001, and \nwas honorably discharged as a sergeant (E-5). He attended college for a period but did \nnot obtain a degree. He was married from 1985 until his divorce in 1992 or 1993. He \nmarried again in 1994 and divorced in January 2009. He has two children, ages 22 and \n13.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in about December 1985, when he was 20 years old, and \ncharged with credit card abuse. The charge was dismissed. He was arrested in March \n1987, and charged with five counts of issuing bad checks. The charges were \ndismissed.2 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a National Agency Questionnaire in April 1991, prior to \nenlisting in the Army. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 18 of the questionnaire which \nasked, \u201cHave you ever been arrested, charged, cited, held, or detained by Federal, \nState, or other law enforcement or juvenile authorities regardless of whether the charge \nwas dropped or dismissed or you were found not guilty.\u201d3  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in March 2000, and charged with assault in the third \ndegree, harassment, and domestic violence. The charges were dismissed.4 \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana in July 2001, while he was in the Army. He was \ndirected to participate in a unit urinalysis shortly thereafter. His urine tested positive for \nthe metabolites of tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. In \nSeptember 2001, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for his marijuana use. He was reduced from \npay grade E-6 to pay grade E-5; and forfeited $1,049 in pay per month for two months.5  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 84-86; GE 1, 4. \n \n2 Tr. at 33-36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 12. \n \n3 GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 10. \n \n5 Tr. at 36-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 9. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe financial security concerns were based on credit reports obtained on June \n27, 2006 and July 25, 2008, and Applicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories which \nincluded a credit report obtained by him on September 15, 2008. The SOR alleges 26 \ndelinquent debts. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.j, 1.p, 1.r, and 1.z. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Specific debts are addressed \nbelow. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c allege three delinquent debts of $40, $52 and $53 owed \nto two pizza restaurants. Applicant admitted to owing the three debts and that the debts \nresulted from when he wrote checks to the restaurants which were returned for \nnonsufficient funds. The debts include fees for the returned checks. Applicant stated \nthat the checks were written right before he transferred duty stations and he was \nunaware that they were returned. He stated that he was willing to pay the debts but he \ncalled the collection company about three years ago and the collection company wanted \n$1,000 per check and would not accept a smaller amount. He stated he was willing to \npay the amount of the checks and reasonable fees but not $3,000 for three checks that \noriginally totaled less than $50. Applicant told an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in November 2006, that one of the restaurants wanted \n$200 for one of the returned checks. He told the investigator that he was unwilling to \npay $200, but he would contact the restaurant and attempt to work out a settlement. He \nstated he would also contact the other restaurant and pay the debts.6  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a delinquent debt of $3,267 owed to a collection company, on \nbehalf of a financial institution. The debt was the amount owed on a car loan after the \ncar was destroyed in a car crash. Applicant submitted documentation that the balance \non the loan was paid by the insurance company in February 2000. The debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h appears to be a duplicate of this debt.7  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a delinquent debt of $106 owed to a collection company, on \nbehalf of a utility company. Applicant disputed owing this debt. He has not lived in the \nstate where this utility provided service in more than 10 years.8  \n \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he owed the delinquent debt \nof $499 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. He stated in his response to interrogatories in September \n2008, that \u201c[t]his item is being paid on and will be fully paid before December 2008.\u201d He \ntestified at the hearing that this was a medical debt that should have been covered by \nhis insurance. He stated that he was in contact with his old insurance company and the \nclaim is being resubmitted. He also stated that the debt was no longer on his credit \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 49-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n7 Tr. at 57-60; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B. \n \n8 Tr. at 60-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nreport. Contrary to Applicant\u2019s statement, this debt is listed on the credit reports of \nSeptember 15, 2008 and July 6, 2009. Both credit reports were submitted by Applicant.9   \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the delinquent debt of $1,656 to a jewelry store, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. He testified that he never had an account with the jewelry store, \nbut his brother who has a similar social security number, had an account with the \njewelry store. He stated that the jewelry store corrected the mistake and removed the \ndebt from his credit report. This debt is listed on the credit report of June 27, 2006, but \nnot the three most recent credit reports in evidence. Applicant provided contradictory \ninformation to the OPM investigator in November 2006. He told the investigator that he \nhad the account with the jewelry store and purchased jewelry for his wife. He stated the \naccount was mistakenly switched to his brother\u2019s name, but he contacted the company \nand had the account switched back to his name. He stated that he would begin repaying \nthe loan immediately.10 I did not find Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony about this debt to be \ncredible. \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the delinquent debt of $116 to a collection company, on \nbehalf of a payday loan company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p. He stated that he attempted \nto contact the company but it is no longer in business. The debt is listed on the \nSeptember 15, 2008 credit report, but it is not listed on the July 6, 2009 credit report.11   \n \n \nApplicant settled the delinquent debt of $721 owed to a financial institution, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r, with a payment of $505 on July 8, 2009.12   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.s alleges a delinquent debt of $496 to a collection company, on behalf \nof what appears to be an internet company. Applicant has consistently denied owing \nthis debt. He testified that his credit repair company wrote a letter disputing the debt. He \ndid not provide a copy of any dispute letters sent by his credit repair company. This debt \nis listed on all the credit reports in evidence.13   \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the delinquent debt of $665 to a collection company, on \nbehalf of a satellite television company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.z. He stated that the debt \nwas for equipment that was not returned when he moved at the end of 2006. He stated \nthat the company told him to take the equipment with him when he moved and it would \nbe installed at his new location. He decided that he did not want the service at his new \nlocation. He stated the company told him that they did not want the equipment. He \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 61-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, AE A. \n \n10 Tr. at 64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6, AE A. \n \n11 Tr. at 65-66; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4, AE A. \n \n12 Tr. at 66-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F. \n \n13 Tr. at 70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-6, AE A. \n \n\n \n5 \n \ntestified that he returned the equipment several months ago and that he left his receipt \nin the car. He did not provide a receipt in his post-hearing submission.14   \n \n \nApplicant retained the services of a credit repair company to assist him in \nimproving his credit rating and deleting adverse entries on his credit report. His contract \nwith the credit repair company does not include financial counseling. Applicant disputed \nowing the remaining debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, and 1.t \nthrough 1.y. None of those debts are listed on the most recent credit report.15 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nApril 27, 2006. The introduction to Section 23 stated: \n \nFor this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your \ncase has been \u201csealed\u201d or otherwise stricken from the court record. The \nsingle exception to this requirement is for certain convictions under the \nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. \n3607. \n \nQuestion 23a of the SF 86 asked, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of \nany felony offense (include those under Uniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d Question \n23e asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been subject to court martial or other \ndisciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice? (Include non-\njudicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.)\u201d Question 23f asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, \nc, d, or e above (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was \nalcohol or drug related.)\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to all the questions. \n \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 24b, which asked: \n \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.) \namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, \netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n \nHe answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 28a and 28b, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have \nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \u201cAre you currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \n \n \nApplicant stated that he did not list his marijuana use and his Article 15 \npunishment because he thought that his Army record was \u201csealed.\u201d He stated in his \nresponse to the SOR: \n                                                          \n14 Tr. at 73-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5. \n \n15 Tr. at 76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4; AE A. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe EPSQ (questionnaire) did not ask me to reveal a matter that is sealed \nin my military record. This matter was understood to me that being sealed, \nI be spared any revelation of my past indiscretion. That indiscretion was \u201cI \nsmoke a Joint\u201d that\u2019s it. So I could continue in my service to country \nwithout having to make knowledge of a past mistake made. Or having to \nwear that incident like a badge of shame for the rest of my life for one \nmistake. I have served my country displaying the finest attributes of a \nUnited States soldier; this is why the matter was put in a restricted fiche. \nThe EPSQ never asked or stated that information that was restricted from \nthe start was material that needed to be provided. \n \nApplicant provided similar testimony at his hearing. He also admitted that he felt that he \nshould have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question and he \u201cwas embarrassed by the situation \nand [he] was pleased that it was sealed.16 Applicant was interviewed for his background \ninvestigation in November 2006. A signed statement was not provided but the interview \nwas memorialized in a report of investigation (ROI). DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the \nROI in an interrogatory and asked him if the ROI accurately reflected the information he \nprovided to the investigator on the day he was interviewed. He was provided the \nopportunity to explain why the ROI was inaccurate and to add additional information \nregarding the matters discussed during the interview. He answered that the ROI was \naccurate and submitted additional information. The ROI indicates that he did not list the \ndrug use and Article 15 punishment because he was embarrassed and wanted to wait \nuntil his security interview.17 After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant \nbelieved that his record was sealed and that the information would not be discovered. I \nfurther find that he knew he should have listed the Article 15 punishment and his drug \nuse, but hoped that the information would not be discovered because it was sealed. I \nfind that Applicant intentionally provided false answers on his SF 86 when he did not list \nhis marijuana use and his Article 15 punishment.  \n \n \nApplicant stated that he did not list his March 2000 arrest and charges of assault, \nharassment, and domestic violence because he did not commit the offenses; the \ncharges were dismissed; he thought the arrest was outside the seven-year window of \nthe question; and he misunderstood the question.18 I did not find his explanations \ncredible. I find that he intentionally omitted information from his SF 86 when he did not \nlist his arrest in 2000. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he answered the financial questions in the negative \nbecause he was unaware he had delinquent debts. He purchased a house with no \ncredit problems and he had not checked a credit report in some time.19  \n \n                                                          \n16 Tr. at 36-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n17 GE 3. \n \n18 Tr. at 44-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3. \n \n19 Tr. at 47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from a supervisor and a letter from a master sergeant \nwho works with Applicant in training soldiers on the contractor\u2019s equipment. Applicant is \ndescribed as an outstanding instructor, and they praise his competence, dedication, \nreliability, integrity, honesty, professionalism, expertise, maturity, and trustworthiness. \nHe is recommended for a security clearance.20  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n                                                          \n20 AE D, E. \n\n \n8 \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has not resolved a number of the debts alleged in the SOR. His \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. Applicant \nessentially denied having any financial problems. He has been steadily employed since \n2001. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant settled the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r. I find that he has \nmade a good-faith effort to pay that delinquent debt, but not the remainder of his \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable only to SOR \u00b6 1.r. He has not received \nfinancial counseling, and there are not clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved and is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed most of the debts alleged in SOR. Many of the debts are no \nlonger listed on his credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to those debts that \nApplicant has admitted are his responsibility or are otherwise established by the \nevidence, even if they have been deleted from his credit report. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable \nto SOR \u00b6 1.i, and the remaining debts that have been deleted from his credit report, \nspecifically those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, and 1.t through \n1.y.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n \nApplicant did not list his criminal record when he submitted a National Agency \nQuestionnaire in April 1991, prior to enlisting in the Army. That questionnaire was \nsubmitted so long ago that Applicant\u2019s intent cannot be discerned at this time. He \nserved in the Army for ten years. If he intentionally falsified the questionnaire in 1991, it \nwas long ago mitigated by the passage of time and his Army service. SOR \u00b6 2.a is \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \n \nIt is unclear if the charge against Applicant in 1985 was a felony. The charge \nwas dismissed. Even if it was a felony, there are insufficient facts for a determination \nthat Applicant knew it was a felony and intentionally omitted it from his SF 86 in 2006. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nThere are insufficient facts for a determination that Applicant intentionally \nomitted financial information from his SF 86 in 2006. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g are concluded \nfor Applicant. \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in 2006, when he failed to divulge his \nmarijuana use, his Article 15 punishment, and his arrest in 2000. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable as a disqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant discussed his marijuana use, his Article 15 punishment, and his arrest \nin 2000, when he was interviewed by an OPM investigator in November 2006. That \ndoes not constitute a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts. While he receives credit for discussing the information with \nthe investigator, it is insufficient to establish a mitigating condition. I find that no \nmitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nIt is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, \nfictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive \nbranch of the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances \nare within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United \nStates.21 A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious offense as it may be punished by \nimprisonment for up to five years. Applicant knowingly and willfully made a materially \nfalse statement on his SF 86, as discussed above. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n                                                          \n21 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n \n\n \n12 \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information on his SF 86 in 2006, which \nconstituted a federal crime. He was not honest in his response to the SOR when he \nstated that he did not intentionally falsify the SF 86. He also was not truthful at his \nhearing when he further denied his actions. No mitigating conditions are applicable to \nhis violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F, E, and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n\n \n13 \n \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s ten years service in the Army. I also considered the very \nfavorable character evidence presented by his supervisor and a master sergeant. \nApplicant does not have a huge amount of delinquent debt. His failure to address his \nfinances speaks more toward a disregard of his obligations rather than an inability to \npay his debts. He intentionally provided false information on his SF 86, and was less \nthan truthful in his response to the SOR and at the hearing. Serious doubts remain \nabout Applicant\u2019s judgment, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations, Personal Conduct, and \nCriminal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.i: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.o: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.r: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.t-1.y: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.f-2.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under financial considerations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on September 25, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n  \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 20, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\n \nOn November 21, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn February 12, 2009, I was assigned the case. On February 19, 2009, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on March 17, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was held open one week to \nallow Applicant to submit documents. No documents were received. On March 31, \n2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.i, 1.j, and 1.o of the SOR. He admitted the remaining factual allegations. The \nadmissions are admitted into evidence.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old internet security and vulnerability analyst who has \nworked for a defense contractor since December 2006, and is seeking to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 18) The SOR alleges Applicant owes 17 debts totaling \napproximately $45,000. Applicant asserts four of the debts, which total approximately \n$3,300, are debts belonging to his ex-wife. Applicant asserts he returned some traction \nequipment (SOR \u00b6 1.o, $355) used in his physical therapy. The equipment was not \ncovered by his health insurance. In 2005, Applicant assets he retuned the item but was \nnever credited with the return. (Tr. 41)  \n \n \nIn September 2000, Applicant separated from the Navy as an E-5 having enlisted \nin January 1993. (Ex. 1) While in the Navy, Applicant held a clearance. (Tr. 23) From \nSeptember 2000 until July 2003, he had three different sales jobs at which he stated he \ndid not perform well. (Tr. 20-21) During those years there were also brief periods of \nunemployment. His wife worked as a self-employed court reporter. (Tr. 21) In July 2003, \nApplicant separated from his ex-wife and they divorced in March 2004. Prior to the \nmarriage, Applicant\u2019s now ex-wife had a son. Applicant and his wife married when the \nchild was one year old. Following the divorce, Applicant agreed to provide tuition for a \nprivate school for the child and his ex-wife agreed to allow visitation. (Tr. 22) \n \n \nFollowing the divorce, his ex-wife stayed in their home and assumed the \nmortgage. Applicant continued to make payments on real estate property located with \nthe home. His ex-wife denied visitation when payments were not made. In order to keep \nhis obligation to his ex-wife current so he could see the child, Applicant failed to make \ncredit card payments. (Tr. 22)  \n \n \nIn November 2008, in response to the SOR, Applicant stated he had put together \na personal plan to pay off many of his debts in the coming months. He planned to start \nwith the smaller and more recent debts and work backwards from there. The plan \nconsisted of him and his wife understanding their debts. (Tr. 55) No payments have \nbeen made as a result of any plan.  \n \n\n \n \n \n3\nApplicant has made no payment on the $16,237 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $2,103 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d), $1,478 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $283 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, the remaining balance on a computer \npurchased while married and used by his ex-wife in her work), $2,688 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), \n$1,014 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), $15,893 (SOR \u00b6 1.m), and $469 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) he owes on a credit \ncard debt. (Tr. 27) Applicant disputes the $15,893 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) credit card debt. In 1999 \nor 2000, he assets he made two payments in one month that were not properly credited \nto his account. (Tr. 39) He stopped making payments on the debt when he failed to \nreceive a return call from a supervisor at the credit card company.  \n \nApplicant asserts three of the debts (SOR \u00b6 1.b, $80, SOR \u00b6 1.c, $160, and SOR \n\u00b6 1.j, $411) were medical debts incurred by his ex-wife after they separated. (Tr. 29) \nWhile married, Applicant and his wife purchased a dining room set (SOR \u00b6 1.i, $2,716), \nwhich was awarded in the divorce to his wife. (Tr. 33) Applicant offered to submit a copy \nof the divorce decree, but no copy of the decree was received following the hearing.  \n \nApplicant asserted he thought he had paid the $243 telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.k), \nbut provided no documentation showing payment. Applicant owes a $184 electrical bill \n(SOR \u00b6 1.q). (Tr. 42)  \n \nIn July 2005, Applicant remarried. His wife is a case manager for a law firm. (Tr. \n44) Applicant and his wife do not have a budget. (Tr. 45) Applicant owns a 2007 pick up \ntruck and his wife owns a 2006 car on which their combined monthly car payments are \nmore than $1,000. Applicant also owes federal income tax for tax years 2003 through \nand including 2007. (Tr. 49) He owes more than $3,400 in tax on which he pays $200 \neach month. (Tr. 56) Applicant and his wife have approximately $47,000 in student \nloans that are deferred until May 2009. (Tr. 62, 63)  \n \nApplicant makes $58,000 a year. His wife makes $48,000. (Tr. 53-54) Applicant \nhas three or four current credit card accounts each less than $1,000. He no longer uses \nthe cards and is behind on payments for all the accounts. (Tr. 47) The credit card \ncompanies are calling him for payment. (Tr. 60)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n \n \n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant has 12 past due accounts placed for collection that total in excess \nof $42,000. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report, his \nSOR response, and his testimony at hearing. Throughout this process, he had admitted \nresponsibility for all but four delinquent debts. None of the debts have been paid. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n  \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has failed to document that four of the debts (SOR & 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, and \n1.j) are his ex-wife\u2019s obligations. These debts total approximately $3,300. He failed to \n\n \n \n \n6\ndocument the return of the $355 traction devise. (SOR & 1.o) Even accepting these five \ndebts, which total less than $4,000, are not his obligations, he still has past due \nobligations placed for collection that total approximately $42,000. None of the mitigating \nfactors apply to the remaining 12 past due obligations.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant\u2019s debts remain unpaid so they are considered a \ncurrent concern. There are numerous debts. The debts were incurred for credit card \nobligations, utility bills, and he owes past due federal tax. These debts are likely to \nrecur. In fact Applicant is past due on his three or four current credit card accounts. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along with \nthe financial burden associated with each. However, he failed to establish how his 2004 \ndivorce affects his current ability to pay his debts. Applicant and his current wife have a \ncombined income of more that $100,000 and the electric bill of less than $200 remains \nunpaid. AG & 20(b) has limited applicability.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), Applicant is paying the IRS $200 per month on \nhis past due tax obligation for tax years 2003 through 2007. This is a good faith effort to \nrepay his debt. However, his income tax obligation is not listed as a debt of concern in \nthe SOR. He has made no payment on any debt listed in the SOR. He is behind on his \ncurrent credit card accounts and receiving calls demanding he pay his bills. AG & 20(c) \nand & 20(d) do not apply. \n \nHis failure to pay his past due obligations raises concerns about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were mainly \ncredit card obligations. His inability to repay these debts indicates poor self-control, lack \nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. He and his wife make in \nexcess of $100,000. They pay more than $1,000 each month in car payments. They are \nunable to keep the three or four credit card accounts, each of less than $1,000, paid in a \ntimely manner. It is noted that three of Applicant\u2019s past due debts are for less than $300 \neach and another two are less than $500 each. He has been unable or unwilling to pay \neven these small debts.  \n \nApplicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations and is unable or \nunwilling to satisfy his debts. He accepts responsibility for the majority of his financial \ndelinquencies. He has done little to resolve or manage his delinquent debts since \nlearning of the government\u2019s concern. All of the debts listed in the SOR remain \nunresolved. He has not established a budget. He has no plan for proper management of \nhis finances and debts. There is no clear indication that his financial problems are being \nresolved or under control.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, financial considerations: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.o: For Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a, 1.d through 1.h,  \n1.k through 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge\n \n",
