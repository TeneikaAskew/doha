On\nDecember 13, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On June 30, 2020, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling about $24,600 and that\nhe deliberately falsified his security clearance application (SCA) by responding negatively to\ninquiries about his financial problems.  In responding to the SOR, he admitted all of the SOR\nallegations but indicated he had paid two of the alleged debts and described his responses to the SCA\ninquiries as \u201csimply a mistake on [his] part\u201d and he \u201cwas not trying to hide anything.\u201d  Decision at\n3, quoting from Government Exhibit (GE) 2.  The Judge found against Applicant on one alleged debt\nand on the sole falsification allegation.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred in finding he was 13 years old when\nhis oldest son was born and also notes this son was adopted.  Regarding this issue, the Judge found:\nIt is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s oldest son, who does not bear his surname, is his\nbiological son, adopted, a stepson, or a foster child.  If the birthdates listed on the\nSCA for Applicant and this son are correct, Applicant was only 13 years old at the\ntime of his son\u2019s birth. [Decision at 4.]\nThe birthdates listed in Applicant\u2019s SCA support the Judge\u2019s challenged finding.  GE 3 at 7 and 23. \nSince Applicant noted in his brief that his oldest son is eight years old, the birthdate listed for him\nin the SCA is apparently not accurate.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions from outside the record.  We cannot consider\nnew evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  For example, Applicant contends the debt to which \nthe Judge found against him no longer appears on any of his credit reports.

GE 5 and Applicant\u2019s Response\nto the File of Relevant Material (FORM) at p. 6 of a 30-page credit report prepared March 10, 2020. \nWe also note that Applicant has not challenged in his brief the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he falsified\nresponses in his SCA.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nNovember 29, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On September 22, 2020, after considering the record, Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process, whether\nthe Judge erred in her findings of fact, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant is college graduate in his late 20s and has worked for a defense contractor for about\nthe past five years.  In her analysis of the disqualifying conditions, the Judge stated:\nAs a youth, Applicant was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome (now\ndiagnosed as ASD [Autism Spectrum Disorder] under the DSM-5 [Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition]), a developmental disorder that\nis characterized by impaired social interaction, repetitive patterns of behavior,\nrestricted interests, atypical sensory responses, and some pragmatic deficits.  He\ndisputes the validity of college reports of his \u201codd behaviors\u201d and \u201cphysical outbursts\nin class,\u201d and the evidence of that behavior is largely hearsay.  However, Applicant\ndid admit to a licensed psychologist in January 2019 that he dominated classes in\ncollege by asking questions excessively and that he lacked some control over that\nbehavior, and that he had counseling in college for social anxiety and disinterest in\nsocializing with others.  In his present job, his ASD has reportedly manifested itself\nin head banging, angry outbursts, running throughout the workplace, and emotional\ndyregulation in front of customers.  During his PSI [personal subject interview], he\ndisclosed that he had been reprimanded at work for chronic tardiness, that he\nintentionally banged his head on a dumpster when he was angry, and that he was\nsuspended from work after he became upset, ran around, and cried about retrieving\na [piece of equipment] near his shift\u2019s end.  During his January 2019 psychological\nevaluation, he admitted that he has attempted to injure himself with a sharp object in\nthe past.  Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 28(a) under Guideline I has some\napplicability.  It provides:\n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability,\nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline\nand that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition,\nincluding, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm,\n2\n\nsuicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful,\nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors.\nIn January 2019, a licensed psychologist diagnosed Applicant with highly-\nfunctioning ASD without accompanying intellectual impairment with generalized\nanxiety.  In her opinion, his ASD is a permanent condition that affects his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness with respect to his psychosocial functioning,\nperceptions, and decision making.  AG \u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified\nmental health professional that the individual has a condition that may impair\njudgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d is also established.  While\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the psychologist\u2019s assessment, her clinical opinion\nis entitled to weight in light of her qualifications and the absence of a contrary\nassessment by a duly-qualified medical or mental-health professional.  [Decision at\n8-9]\nIn her analysis of the mitigating conditions, the Judge noted factors that weighed in favor of\nApplicant, including that the psychologist found him to be relatively stable at the time of his\nevaluation and opined he is capable of following directions, but she also opined he is likely to\ncontinue having problems with decision-making.  The psychologist gave him only a fair prognosis. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant failed to rebut sufficiently the opinion of the psychologist that\nhis condition affects his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  In her whole-person analysis, the\nJudge also noted that, because Applicant chose to have his security clearance eligibility evaluated\nwithout a hearing, she was unable to assess his sincerity or demeanor and cited ISCR Case No. 19-\n02544 (App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2020) for the proposition that credibility determinations without the\nbenefit of in-person demeanor observations are indistinguishable from a judge\u2019s fact-finding based\non purely documentary evidence.  Applicant also failed to present any employment or character\nreferences attesting to his current judgment or reliability.    \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant highlights the Judge\u2019s findings that noted he failed to present\ncertain evidence, such as failing to provide corroboration of some of his assertions and failing to\nsubmit character reference statements.  He notes that he had an understanding that he should keep\nhis employment relationship with a particular Government agency strictly confidential.  He states,\n\u201c. . . I must confess that there was a terribly strong, unspoken assumption on options were strictly\nlimited when it came to the question of whom I could communicate my clearance predicament to.\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 2.  He further argues there was little opportunity to reach out to his management\n\u201ceven if [he] seriously considered to\u201d due to Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) workplace restrictions\nas well as personnel turnovers at work.  Id. at 2-3.  Furthermore, he asserts that he thought DOHA\nwould contact his company\u2019s human resource specialist to obtain corroborating evidence or\ntestimony.  We interpret these assertions as raising the issue of whether Applicant was denied due\nprocess.  \nApplicant was provided a copy of the Directive when he received the SOR.  Directive \u00b6\n3\n\nE3.1.15 provides \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  In Department\nCounsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) and its forwarding letter, Applicant was informed that,\nunless he presented additional information, the Judge would base her decision solely upon the\ninformation contained in the FORM.  Applicant was given 20 days from receipt of the SOR and 30\ndays from receipt of the FORM to respond to those documents.  There is no indication in the record\nthat Applicant requested an extension of time to respond to either document.  Neither Department\nCounsel nor the Judge had a duty to obtain or present mitigating evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n12-10335 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017).  If Applicant wanted the Judge to consider a statement from\nhis human resource specialist or any other evidence, it was his responsibility to provide it to her. \nApplicant has not alleged that he was misled by any Government official about his rights or\nresponsibilities under the Directive, but rather attributed the evidentiary omissions to his lack of\nunderstanding of the adjudicative process.  Any incorrect assumptions Applicant may have made or\nmisunderstandings he may have had regarding his rights and responsibilities under the Directive\ncannot fairly be placed on DOHA or other DoD officials.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03168 at 3\n(App. Bd. Jul. 21, 2017).  Having decided to represent himself during the proceedings below,\nApplicant is not entitled to be relieved of the consequences of his decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n03-04779 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005). Applicant has failed to establish that he was denied the due\nprocess afforded him under the Directive.\nAs a related matter, Applicant highlights the Judge\u2019s citation to ISCR Case No. 19-02544\n(App. Bd. Aug. 31, 2020) and her comment that she was unable to assess his sincerity and demeanor\nbecause he chose to have his security eligibility evaluated without a hearing.  He contends that he\nwas unaware of \u201ca government preference for one way of decision-making over another\u201d (Appeal\nBrief at 4) and further states:\nThe Appeal Board may have recently stressed the effective benefit of in-person\ndemeanor observations for credibility determinations, but I never had this\nunderstanding, much less the foresight to anticipate such a standard in an August 31,\n2020 decision regarding a separate case\u2014over a month after I wrote my July letter\n[FORM Response] to contribute to the written record.  Naturally ignorant of such \ncredibility determinations, I felt no obligation to defend my method of\ncommunication or stress a sincerity that I assumed to be self-evident. [Id.]\nFirst, there is no Government preference as to whether an applicant requests a hearing or a decision\non the written record.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.4 and E3.1.7 (Department Counsel may, however, request\na hearing if applicant does not elect one).  Second, the Appeal Board decision cited above did not\nestablish a new precedent.  In fact, the language in question in that decision is a direct quote from\nISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003).  The Board has long held that when an\napplicant waives a hearing and chooses to have his or her case decided by a Judge based on a written\nrecord, the Judge has no ability to make a credibility determination based on observation of the\napplicant\u2019s demeanor.  Accordingly, a credibility determination based solely on a written record is\nnot entitled to the same deference on appeal as a credibility determination based on observation of\n4\n\na witness\u2019s demeanor.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case No. 97-0625 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 1998).  As noted\nabove, an applicant, even if pro se, is generally responsible for the consequences of his or her\ndecisions.  Applicant has not established any error in the way in which the Judge analyzed the\nevidence.  \nApplicant challenges that Judge\u2019s finding that he was \u201cnot specific as to the source or nature\nof the counseling\u201d he planned to seek after the COVID-19 pandemic was resolved.  Appeal Brief at\n3, quoting from Decision at 6-7.  He notes that he provided information reflecting he and his family\nobtained family counseling from a specific organization for an intrafamily conflict and essentially\nargues the source and nature of the counseling he planned to seek was adequately identified.  His\nargument has merit.  The Judge cites to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A as the evidence supporting the\nchallenged finding.  A review of AE A reveals the counseling Applicant indicated he intended to\nseek after resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic was the family counseling for the intrafamily\nconflict as opposed to counseling for his mental health condition.  Although the Judge erred in this\nchallenged findings, it was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nApplicant further challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusions that he has a permanent development\ndisorder that affects his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  He also contends that he has\nmitigated the Guideline I security concerns.  His arguments amount to a disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that the Judge reached conclusions\nthat are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 20, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph D. Jordan, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nFebruary 3, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 16, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in his late 20s, has never been married and has no children.  He has earned\na bachelor\u2019s degree.  He was granted a security clearance in 2014.  He was unemployed from\nSeptember 2017 to September 2018 when his former employer lost a contract.  In his analysis, the\nJudge summarized the case as follows:\nApplicant had three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $29,454,\nclaiming that because of a period of unemployment, he did not have sufficient funds \nto maintain them in a current status.  When the SOR was issued in February 2020,\nall three accounts were still delinquent, and Applicant had only made one voluntary\npayment to one creditor in October 2018, and a number of involuntary garnishment\npayments to another.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) [inability to satisfy debts] and 19(c) [a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations] have been established, but there is no evidence that\nApplicant has been unwilling to satisfy debt regardless of an ability to do so, and AG\n\u00b6 19(b)  has not been established.  [Decision at 6.]\n* * *     \nOne of the accounts, for $21,944, was charged off in June 2018, and he made\nonly one $3,240 payment to the creditor in October 2018.  Following the charge-off,\nand since that time, he has made no other payments, despite promising to do so,\nwhile continuing to use the vehicle for which the loan was opened.  Another account\nfor approximately $10,393 was also charged off, but despite securing employment\nin September 2018, he offered no evidence of any voluntary payments to the creditor. \nInstead, in May 2019, a Garnishment Summons was issued in the amount of $10,524,\nand another such summons was issued in January 2020 in the amount of $5,567. \nInvoluntary (garnishment) payments were made, but the documentary evidence of the\ndates and amounts of those payments were disputed by Applicant.  He finally\naddressed the third delinquent account, the one for $358, but only did so after the\nNotice of Hearing had been issued.  [Decision at 6-7.]\n2\n\nThe Judge concluded that AG 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending\npractices, or identity thief), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d partially\napplied due to Applicant\u2019s unemployment, but none of the other mitigating conditions applied.  The\nJudge noted that Applicant\u2019s repeated promises to make payments were not timely fulfilled.  \nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant\u2019s Counsel does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific\nfindings of fact.  Rather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the\nDirective.  He first argues the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, but he fails to identify any\nspecific piece of evidence that the Judge supposedly did not consider.  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states\notherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001), citing Western Pacific\nFisheries, Inc. v. SS President Grant, 730 F.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1984) for that proposition.  A\nparty\u2019s bare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut that\npresumption. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also argues the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s debts were not\ninfrequent.  In support of his argument, he points out that Applicant did not encounter any financial\ndifficulties before his period of unemployment and has not incurred any new delinquent debts since\nhis re-employment.  In his analysis, the Judge noted that Applicant failed to resolve one debt in a\nvoluntary and timely manner before his wages were garnished, failed to resolve another debt until\nthe SOR was issued, and has taken little action to resolve the third debt.  Based on the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis of the facts regarding the three alleged debts, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s key\nconclusion at issue here, i.e., that AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment;\u201d did not apply in this\ncase.  As stated, for AG \u00b6 20(a) to apply fully to an infrequent financial problem, it must also be\nestablished that the financial problem does \u201cnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment[.]\u201d\n \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel further contends that the Judge did not properly apply the mitigating\nconditions and whole-person concept.  In making those arguments, he assets that the Judge did not\ngive proper weight to certain evidence, such as his year of unemployment and his efforts to reduce\nor resolve his debts.  However, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence,\nor an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02463 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018).  \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel relies on decisions of Hearing Office Judges to argue the Judge erred\nin this case.  He cites those decisions to show that Judges decided in favor of applicants in particular\nfact scenarios.  His reliance on those Hearing Office decisions is misplaced.  Decisions by Hearing\n3\n\nOffice Judges are not legally binding precedent that the Appeal Board must follow.  The Board is\nneither required to justify why it chooses not to follow Hearing Office decisions nor required to\nreconcile its decisions with such lower decisions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-00327 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 20, 2020).  Nor are Hearing Office Judges required to follow\u2014or otherwise justify or reconcile\ntheir decisions with\u2014other Hearing Office decisions.  Id.  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits[.]\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  In this regard, it merits noting that the scope of our\nreview is narrow.  We examine a Judge\u2019s challenged conclusions to determine whether they are\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  See ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 2\n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) for the proposition that we may not substitute our judgment for that of the\nJudge, which is what Applicant\u2019s Counsel, in effect, is advocating by citing Hearing Office cases. \nSee, also, ISCR Case No. 11-13965 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2013)(\u201cWe do not have to agree with a\nJudge\u2019s decision to find it sustainable.\u201d).  Generally, how particular fact scenarios in other cases\nwere decided at the Hearing Office level is not a relevant consideration in our review of a case.  \n   \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel has failed to establish any harmful error below.  The Judge examined\nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nFebruary 28, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On July 16, 2020, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Shari\n Dam denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge\u2019s Finding of Fact\nApplicant, who is in his mid-50s, is married with five children.  He served in the U.S.\nmilitary for about four years and received an honorable discharge.  With the exception of a one-\nmonth period, he has been steadily employed since 2010.  He began his current job less than two\nyears ago. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $32,000.  These debts\narose about four to ten years ago.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant denied the alleged debts,\nclaiming he was no longer obligated to pay them because the statute of limitations for their collection\nhad expired. \nApplicant attributed the alleged debts to his child\u2019s serious medical problems.  Applicant\u2019s\nmedical insurance did not cover many of the bills.  This resulted in him being unable to pay family\nliving expenses and maintain debt payments.  Although he contemplated filing bankruptcy, he\ndetermined it would be to his benefit to allow the statute of limitation on the debts to expire.  He\nclaimed that he paid taxes on some of the cancelled debts but failed to provide documentation\ncorroborating those assertions.  Many of the alleged debts are not reflected in a recent credit report.\nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s debts arose from conditions largely beyond his control, but he did not produce\nevidence to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances.  The absence of a debt from\na credit report does not establish it was satisfactorily resolved.  Citing various Appeal Board\ndecisions, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s reliance on the statute of limitations did not  mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from the alleged debts.\nDiscussion\nIn his appeal brief, Applicant challenges some of the Judge\u2019s conclusions by arguing he\npresented evidence in mitigation.  Noting that only one debt continues to appear on his credit report,\n2\n\nApplicant asserts that Mitigating Condition 20(a) applied because his alleged debts happened a long\ntime ago, were so infrequent, happened under circumstances unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt\non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  He also asserts Mitigating Condition\n20(b) was established because his debts arose from conditions beyond his control, i.e., his child\u2019s\nserious medical problems for which he did not have insurance.   We find no error in the Judge\u2019s\nconclusions.  The fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any\nmeaningful evidence as to the disposition of the debt.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00683 at 2 (App.\nBd. Oct. 19, 2018).  Additionally, for Mitigating Condition 20(b) to apply, an applicant must not\nonly experience a circumstance largely beyond his or her control (such as unexpected medical issues)\nthat resulted in the financial problem, but also show he or she has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(b).  In general, Applicant\u2019s arguments amount\nto a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that the\nJudge\u2019s analysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020).     \nApplicant also cites the Judge\u2019s finding that he did not participate in financial counseling and\ncontends that financial counseling is required for those seeking bankruptcy and, since he did not file\nbankruptcy, he was being unfairly penalized for failing to seek financial counseling.  This contention\nis not accurate.  Mitigating Condition 20(c) is not limited to the credit counseling required to file\nbankruptcy.  See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 109(h) and 111.  Rather, it provides that Guideline F security concerns\nmay be mitigated by any financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source that is\naccompanied by clear indications the applicant\u2019s financial problem is being resolved or is resolved. \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(c).  Applicant\u2019s Notice of Appeal included a Certificate of\nCounseling that post-dated the Judge\u2019s decision.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.        \n \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only\nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Applicant requested a decision\non the written record.  On July 17, 2020, Administrative Judge Darlene D.

Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required,  his Federal and state income tax\nreturns for 2007-2017 and that he had a delinquent debt of about $114.  The Judge found against\nApplicant on the tax return filing deficiencies and in favor of him on the alleged debt.  In her\ndecision, the Judge found that, during a former marriage from 2006 to 2014, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\nfiled income tax returns each year in which she claimed only herself and their children.  For an\neleven-year period during and after his former marriage, Applicant did not file tax returns and\nallowed his ex-wife to continue to file the tax returns in that manner even though he knew such\naction would cause him future tax problems.  Applicant filed his Federal and state income tax returns\nfor 2014-2018 in November 2019.

Applicant also contends: \nThe Directive does not give an Administrative Judge [sic] to decide the outcome of \nany case, criminal or civil. \nDetermining criminal guilt on the \u201csubstantial \nevidence\u201d standard is a heinous offense of legal system. Criminal offenses are \ndecided by \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \nCivil offenses are decided by a \n\u201cpreponderance of the evidence,\u201d which is at least 50%. Substantial evidence on \nthe other hand, is described as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support conclusions in light of all contrary evidence in the \nsame record.\u201d  [Appeal Board citation omitted.] \nThere is no phrase or order in the Directive that permits an administrative judge to \nrule upon criminal (or civil) matters.  They are only allowed to rule upon evidence \nthat is in front of them. It would be a different matter if [Applicant] was criminally \ncharged or any of the similar circumstances, but this is not the case. [Applicant] \nwas not charged, convicted, or even expunged of the matter. The prosecutors \ndecided not to charge him. Any person can muse as to why this occurred, but in \nthe field of law, the answer is clear\u2014he is not presumed or convicted as a guilty \nperson. Guilt of a criminal allegation must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt\u2014 \nthe highest standard of proof in American law. Guilt of a civil litigation must be \nproven beyond a preponderance of the evidence\u2014which is essentially 51%. \nAdministrative judges are not presumed to prove a criminal (or civil) allegation. \nAs per the Directive, they are solely allowed to weigh evidence given to them\u2014not \ndecide upon said evidence. \u201cThe ultimate decision that determines innocence or \nguilt are either decided between the judge and/or the jury. This case demonstrates \nthat he tossed our judicial standards in exchange for his own.   \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cThe right to be heard by a fair and impartial adjudicator has long been considered \na fundamental right in American courts.\u201d 403 U.S. 212, 216 (1971). Without a \ndoubt, the administrative judge in this case is anything but impartial.  \nAdministrative judges are not given the power to make these decisions.  \n[Applicant\u2019s brief at 7.] \nApplicant\u2019s contention about the Judge overstepping his authority lacks merit. Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s argument, the Judge did not find him \u201cguilty of a crime\u201d or convict him of a criminal \noffense.  On the other hand, it is fair to say the decision by the law enforcement authorities in this \ncase not to pursue criminal charges against Applicant due to the mother\u2019s decision not to let her \ndaughter testify does not amount to a finding of \u201cnot guilty\u201d or a determination of innocence. \nAlthough there is no evidence that Applicant was arrested for, charged with, or convicted of a \nsexual assault, the Judge was not precluded from concluding Applicant engaged in such conduct.  \n\u201cIn DOHA proceedings, a Judge can make findings of criminal conduct even if the applicant has \nnot been formally charged with a criminal offense by the relevant criminal authorities.\u201d See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 03-04931 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2005). See also, ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018) (\u201cEven if criminal charges are reduced, dropped, or result in an acquittal, \nthe Judge may still consider the underlying conduct in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility.\u201d). A disqualifying condition at issue in this case highlights this point. Under \nDisqualifying Condition 13(a), a security concern could arise from \u201csexual behavior of a criminal \nnature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 13(a) \n(emphasis added). In this case, the Judge\u2019s determination that Applicant committed a sexual \nassault is merely an administrative conclusion that substantial evidence exists in the record to \nestablish Applicant engaged in security-significant conduct. Applicant failed to establish that the \nJudge acted beyond the authority provided him in the Directive when he concluded Applicant \ncommitted a sexual assault. \nAs to Applicant\u2019s contention that he did not commit the alleged offense, we do not find \nthis argument persuasive. From our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s material findings and \nconclusions that Applicant committed a sexual assault are based on substantial evidence or \nconstitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019).  \nWe also do not find persuasive Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge was not impartial. \nThis contention is apparently based on Applicant\u2019s incorrect belief that the Judge acted beyond his \nauthority in concluding he committed a sexual assault. Applicant has not directed our attention to \nanything in the record that would likely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking \nin the requisite impartiality. His argument fails to meet the heavy burden on him to rebut the \npresumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jan. 30, 2020).  \nApplicant also argues the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, mis-weighed the \nevidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. He \nargues, for example, the alleged behavior never occurred is, therefore, unlikely to recur. He also \ntakes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201chis denials only serve to indicate that he is not \nrehabilitated.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6, quoting from Decision at 6.

On \nDecember 14, 2018, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On July 23, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. \nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his fifties, has been working for a Federal contractor since 2017 and \npreviously worked for others. He has served honorably in the military. He provided character \nletters describing him as an outstanding individual who is reliable, follows procedures, and has the \nhighest integrity.   \nThe SOR initially contains seven allegations, but the Government withdrew six of them.  \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the remaining allegation, i.e., that he failed to file, as \nrequired, his Federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2010.  \nIn his 2017 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed that he failed to file \nand pay his Federal taxes for 2007 and failed to file his Federal taxes for 2010. He also stated he \nwould work with the IRS to correct this situation. In a subsequent background interview, he noted \nhis tax deficiencies were not for tax year 2007 but instead for 2006.  The IRS notified him that he \nowed $6,000 to $7,000 for 2006 and $1,000 for 2010. He also indicated that he thought he filed \nhis 2006 tax return while deployed to a combat zone. The majority of his files were in storage, \nand he would retrieve them to file the tax returns. At the hearing, he noted he was unsuccessful in \nobtaining his 2006 return from the IRS. He also testified that he had saved all returns but destroyed \nthem after seven years and the running of the statute of limitations.  In a post-hearing submission, \nApplicant presented an IRS tax transcript that shows he filed his 2006 Federal income tax return \nin August 2008 and owed about $7,800 in taxes. It also reflects that adjustments for interest, \npenalties, and tax refund withholdings were made over the years, and the IRS had written off a \nbalance of about $7,200 in September 2017. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay taxes was not alleged in \nthe SOR but may be considered in analyzing the whole-person concept, in making a credibility \ndetermination, and in assessing the mitigative evidence.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his SCA, Applicant indicated he failed to file his 2010 Federal income tax return because \nhe did not have money to pay the taxes due to unemployment. \u201cHe put this debt on the \u2018back \nburner[.]\u2019\u201d Decision at 4. He intended to resolve this issue by the end of 2017. At the hearing, \nhe claimed he had filed his 2010 tax return but could not prove it. He also noted that, before his \n2017 interview, the IRS informed him that he needed to file his 2010 tax return again because they \ndid not have it. He tried to file again but stated that, due to the statute of limitations, the IRS would \nnot accept it.  \nApplicant failed to provide his IRS tax transcript for 2010. He claimed he could not \nretrieve documents from the IRS that were older than 10 years and provided an IRS document \nshowing transcripts were available for 2011-2021. \u201cHe did not provide an explanation for why he \ncould request and receive in June 2021 the computer generated 2006 transcript and not the 2010 \ntranscript.\u201d Decision at 5. He testified that, to best of his knowledge, he had done everything to \ncomply with the tax requirements given his deployments and the other issues. He failed to explain \nwhy he did not resolve this issue in 2017, as he earlier said he would.  \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided his signed 2010 Federal income tax return with a \nreceipt showing it was mailed on June 18, 2021. He noted he found a folder with his 2010 W-2s \nand receipts but did not indicate whether he had a copy of his Federal tax return for that year. His \naccountant recommended he re-file that return.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s testimony contradicted his disclosures in his SCA, his statement to the \ngovernment investigator, and the 2006 tax transcript. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible.\u201d Decision at 6. \n[Applicant] told the government investigator he would resolve the issue by the end \nof 2017. He did not and now relies on his inability to obtain documents because \nthe ten years has passed and the statute of limitations has tolled. He also told the \ninvestigator that his documents were in storage, and he was going to retrieve them \nand resolve the issue. He did not. Instead, he testified that he does not keep \ndocuments past seven years. At the time the issue arose, it was within seven years. \nIt is disingenuous to destroy documents that may have pertained to 2010 when he \nput the government on notice that he had the issue in 2017. It is unknown why he \ncould provide computerized 2006 tax transcripts, but could not provide 2010 tax \ntranscripts. He did not provide any documents from the IRS corroborating any \naction he may have taken in the past resolving his 2010 tax return. [Decision at 8.] \nApplicant did not act responsibly in resolving his tax issues. He had years after submitting his \nSCA to resolve them, but failed to do so. His failure file his 2010 return in a timely manner \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.            \nDiscussion \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. Rather, \nhe contends the Judge\u2019s conclusions were arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law because she \nimproperly refused to apply Mitigating Condition 20(a) to conduct that occurred over 10 years ago \nwithout recurrence, she improperly articulated the security concern as a \u201cfailure to timely resolve \nhis tax issues,\u201d she failed to conduct properly the whole-person assessment, and she misapplied \nAppeal Board precedent. Appeal Brief at 1-2. In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions are \narbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does \nnot examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, \nincluding a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider \nrelevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the \ncase; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so \nimplausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n16-02322 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018). See also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. \nState Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\u201344 (1983) (discussing the scope of review under \nthe \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard). In deciding whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions are contrary \nto law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, \nthe Directive, or other applicable Federal law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-20115 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJul. 29, 2005). \nApplicant\u2019s argument that the Judge erred in failing to apply Mitigating Condition 20(a) is \nnot persuasive. Applicant correctly points out the evidence establishes that his failure to file his \nFederal tax returns as required occurred about 10 years ago and that no evidence was presented to \nshow any recurrence. However, the mere length of time that has elapsed since the occurrence of \nhis last tax filing delinquency is not determinative in deciding whether the alleged security \nconcerns were mitigated. To receive full credit under Mitigating Condition 20(a), a Judge must \nnot only conclude \u201cthe behavior happen so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d but also that the behavior \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\u201d See Directive, Encl. 2, App. \nA \u00b6 20(a). In other words, when the behavior at issue occurred is only part of the analysis under \nthis mitigating condition. The Judge should also consider all the circumstances surrounding that \nbehavior to determine whether it reflects negatively on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. This includes consideration of delays in resolving financial delinquencies. As \nthe Appeal Board has previously stated, \u201c[t]he timing of the resolution of financial problems is an \nimportant factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who begins \nto resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there \nis no immediate threat to his own interests.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 26, 2017). We find no basis for concluding the Judge misapplied Mitigating Condition 20(a). \nApplicant\u2019s contention that the Judge failed to conduct properly the whole-person \nassessment is not convincing. He points out, for example, that the Judge did not discuss that he \nhas held a security clearance for over 30 years without incident. Of note, the Judge made findings \nabout Applicant\u2019s background, including his military service, and his character letters and stated \nin her whole-person assessment that she \u201cconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions in light of the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\u201d \nDecision at 9.  \nApplicant\u2019s argument fails to meet the heavy burden on him to rebut the presumption that the \nJudge considered all of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMar. 31, 2020). In short, we find no basis to conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person assessment \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nWe find no merit in Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge misapplied Appeal Board and \nFederal court precedent.  This assignment of error involves the Judge quotes from ISCR Case No. \n12-10933 at 3 (App, Bd. Jun. 29, 2016): \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local \n473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d , 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n[Decision at 9.] \nApplicant argues that the facts in the cited Appeal Board decision (ISCR Case No. 14-01894) are \ndistinguishable from those in his case.  The Judge, however, did not cite that decision or McElroy \nto address the facts in those cases but instead she cited them for the legal principle stated in the \nquote. That legal principle applies equally to repeated failures to fulfill tax filing obligations. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017).  \nIn summary, Applicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.

The \nJudge found against Applicant on a single allegation that was cross-alleged under Guidelines M and \nE. Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in an evidentiary ruling, \nwhether the evidence was sufficient to establish that Applicant violated a former employer\u2019s policies, \nand whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nApplicant, who is in his 30s, has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been working in the \ninformation technology (IT) field for an number of years and has been working for a defense \ncontractor for the past two years. \nIn late 2014, Applicant\u2019s employer suspected him of suspicious computer activity. The Judge \nspecifically found: \n[A]n analysis of one of Applicant\u2019s computers indicated that he attempted to initiate \na peer-to-peer connection with a remote host outside his employer\u2019s network. This \ntype of activity was prohibited because of its potential to bypass the employer\u2019s \nsecurity measures.

(GE 2 at \n9) After an investigation, Applicant was terminated for violation of his employer\u2019s \nInternet use policy. (Answer at 1-2) \nApplicant admits that he demonstrated bad judgment accessing some of his \n\u201cpersonal stuff\u201d on his work computer. (Tr. 58) However, he contends that he \nvisited hacking-related websites for educational and professional development, and \nthat cyber-securityexperts need to understand how hackers operate in order to defend \nagainst them. (Answer at 2; Tr. 56) He characterized this concept as \u201cethical \nhacking,\u201d and testified that he was earning an online certification in this field while \nworking for his former employer. (Tr. 54) Applicant contends that his employer \nallowed him to use the office computer for studying and practical assignments related \nto his certification during down time. Also, Applicant testified that he made a mistake \nby not memorializing this permission in writing. (Tr. 57-58; 119) \nThere were occasions on Applicant\u2019s job when information technology \nspecialists might need to visit websites related to hacking for research, or download \npassword-cracking software to gain access to a system where a password was lost. \nThese situations were exceedingly rare. \n(GE 2 at 8) Applicant\u2019s employer \ncharacterized the volume ofhacking-related content combined withthe absence ofany \nspecific project that required that type of information \u201cdisconcerting,\u201d and \ncharacterized Applicant\u2019s behavior as a demonstration of\u201cincrediblypoor judgment.\u201d \n(GE 2 at 9) [Decision at 3-4.] \nThere is no evidence that Applicant misused information technology in the past five years. \nHe has informed subsequent employers of his employment termination, completed security training \ncourses, and is highly respected in his current job. The Judge, however, concluded: \nApplicant\u2019s violations ofhis ex-employer\u2019s Internet use policywere extremely \nserious, as they involved visiting websites containing network hacking and password-\ncracking tutorials. These violations were particularly egregious because Applicant \nwas responsible, in part, with developing malware defenses for his employer. Under \nthese circumstances, his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment, and AG \u00b6 41(a) is inapplicable. Given the \nunusually high volume of visits to inappropriate hacking websites, and in light of \n1 The quoted sentence from GE 2 at 7 does not contain the year \u201c2015.\" Since GE 2 is dated in January 2015, \nit is apparent that document was referring to September 2014, vice 2015. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nevidence that Applicant attempted to obscure some of his illicit Internet activity, AG \n\u00b6 41(d) also does not apply.

In sum, there \nis limited evidence of mitigating, but in light of the nature and seriousness of the \nviolations, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns. [Decision at 7.] \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant essentially contends that the Judge erred in admitting into \nevidence an investigative report from his previous employer laying out Applicant\u2019s network activity2 \nbecause it was not authenticated. The investigative report was a portion of GE 2. The Federal Rules \nof Evidence serve as a guide in industrial security cases. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19. Unless the Directive \nprovides otherwise, those rules of evidence may be relaxed to permit the development of a full and \ncomplete record. Id. The Appeal Board examines a Judge\u2019s challenged evidentiary rulings to \ndetermine if they are consistent with the Directive and to determine if they are arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017). \nThe authentication issue that Applicant is raising on appeal was addressed below. At the \nhearing, Applicant was represented by counsel who objected to the investigative report on the \ngrounds that it was not authenticated. Initially, the Judge ruled that portions of GE 2 were \nadmissible, but the investigative report in that exhibit (GE 2 at 7-10) was inadmissible. Tr. at 11-19. \nAfter Department Counsel later offered into evidence email communications (GE 4-6) regarding GE \n2, the Judge withdrew his initial ruling on the investigative report, decided to reserve making a ruling \nabout the admissibility of those pages at that time, and provided the parties the opportunity to \nsubmitted additional matters regarding this issue after the hearing. Tr. at 71-78, 88-91, 146-147, and \n160-161. In a post-hearing submission, Department Counsel offered another email, admitted into \nevidence as GE 7, that confirmed the investigative report was from the former employer\u2019s internal \npersonnel records. In the decision, the Judge noted that he had admitted pages 7-10 of GE 2 into the \nrecord. From our review of the record, we conclude the Judge did not err by admitting the \ninvestigative report into evidence. \nAs a related matter, Applicant contends that Department Counsel had a copy of the \ninvestigative report before the SOR was issued but did not make that document available to him until \nhe requested a hearing. The record reflects that Applicant was provided a copy of GE 2 in \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s discovery letter that was sent to him on January 22, 2020, more than six \nmonths before the hearing was held. The Directive does not contain any provision that required \nDepartment Counsel to provide Applicant a copy of the investigative report when the SOR was \nissued. Applicant has failed to establish that the due process rights afforded him under the Directive \nwere violated. \n2 The previous employer was part of another branch of the U.S. Government and not within DoD. The \nprevious employer\u2019s investigative report was not a DoD personnel background report of investigation (ROI) that, as \nset forth in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, would have required authentication. \n4 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant notes that he was never investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation or \ncharged with any criminal violation even though some information in the investigative report reflects \nhe engaged in such conduct. He is apparently relying on the lack of a criminal investigation or \ncharges as a basis to argue the former employer\u2019s investigative report lacks merit. Even though there \nis no evidence that an applicant was investigated by law enforcement authorities or that he was never \narrested, charged, or convicted of an offense, a Judge may still find the applicant engaged in \nmisconduct that raises security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04931 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2005). Applicant also contends the investigative report in GE 2 contains unfounded allegations. In \nthis regard, we have previously stated that an employer\u2019s decisions and characterizations of events \nare entitled to some deference. Such deference extends to an employer\u2019s internal investigation. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019). It is also noted that the investigation \nin question was conducted by a Federal court, and there is a rebuttable presumption that Federal \nofficials and employees carry out their duties in good faith. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02347 at \n4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). Applicant\u2019s challenges to the investigative report are not persuasive. \nApplicant argues that insufficient evidence was presented to show that he had knowledge of \nthe former employer\u2019s IT rules. This contention is not persuasive. Knowledge may be established \nby circumstantial evidence. In this case, GE 2 contains a copy of the former employer\u2019s Internet Use \nPolicy that Applicant signed in June 2014. That document lists the two specific policies that \nApplicant\u2019s termination letter states he violated.  GE 2 at 2. Applicant certified that he had read his \nemployer\u2019s internet policy and would comply with it. GE 2 at 6. Furthermore, Applicant worked in \nthe IT field for a number of years before his employment termination. From our review of the record, \nthe Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions of a security concern are based on substantial evidence \nor constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s \nweighing of the evidence.  He argues, for example, that his sole purpose in visiting the questionable \nwebsites was for professional development. The Judge noted this claim in his findings of fact. Based \non the Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant violated the former employer\u2019s IT policies and attempted \nto concealhis conduct, it is apparent that he dismissed Applicant\u2019s claimthat his visits to questionable \nwebsites were for authorized purposes. In this regard, it merits noting that we give deference to a \nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are \nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn July 10, 2019, Department Counsel amended the SOR by adding a Guideline E (Personal \nConduct ) allegation. On October 16, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn January 6, 2021, we remanded the case to the Judge to correct identified errors and to \nissue an new decision in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. On February 3, 2021, the Judge \nissued a Remand Decision in which he again found in favor of Applicant on the sole Guideline E \nallegation and on two of the five alleged debts. The Judge found against Applicant on three alleged \ndelinquent student loans.  Applicant appealed the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings in the Remand Decision were not raised as an issue in this \nappeal. Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings and \nconclusions were supported by record evidence and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact \nApplicant, who is in his 70s, has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, \nsince 2016. His is a widower.  In the 1960s, he served on active duty in the military and earned a \nBronze Star and Purple Heart.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had three delinquent student loans totaling about $117,000. \nApplicant denied these SOR allegations with explanations. He guaranteed the student loans for his \nchild\u2019s education. The student loans are reflected in credit reports that were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant experienced periods of unemployment between 2011 and 2016. After the student \nloans came due, his wife made payments on those loans for about two years until she passed away \nin late 2013. Following her passing, the student loans went into default because Applicant did not \nassume responsibility for making the payments. He could not confirm whether his child made any \npayments on those loans or whether the loans were ever placed in forbearance.  \nApplicant asserted that the three student loans were consolidated into one loan but provided \nno documentary evidence corroborating that assertion. From early 2016 to early 2020, the \nDepartment of the Treasury placed two of the student loans totaling about $78,100 into a collection \nstatus, began withholding about $300 to $340 of Applicant\u2019s monthly social security benefits, and \napplied those payments to the student loans. Over that period, the social security withholdings \ntotaled in excess of $9,000 and were applied only to fees and interest. The principle balance of those \n2 \n\nProof of the Student Loans \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nloansremain basicallyunchanged. In early2020, the withholdings stopped, likelyduetocoronavirus \npandemic, and likely may resume as the pandemic fades.     \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $40,000. He receives annual social security benefits of \nabout $25,000 and annual pension payments of about $9,500. He has a home mortgage. He \nmaintains an average monthly checking account balance of about $1,600 and an average monthly \nsavings account balance of about $600. Given these circumstances, he should have been able to \nmake some voluntary payments towards the student loans but did not do so. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and the passing of his wife in 2013 merit some credit \nunder Mitigating Condition 20(b), i.e., the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization bypredatorylending practices, \nor identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  However, he has \nfailed to satisfy the second prong of that mitigating condition. \u201c[H]e has failed to take any \ndocumented voluntary steps to address his accumulated delinquent student loan debts and provide \npersuasive proof of his voluntary addressing his delinquent debts in issue.\u201d Remand Decision at 10. \nDebt reduction though involuntary action, such as a garnishment or attachment, does not reflect an \nindividual is making a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s past and present failures to address and resolve his accumulated student debt \ndelinquencies reflect adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently stable manner \nto meet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance.  At this time it is too soon to \nmake safe predictions that Applicant will be able to voluntarily, or even involuntarily, resolve his \naccrued student debts within the foreseeable future.\u201d  Remand Decision at 11.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends the Government did not prove that he owed the alleged student loans. \nIn making this argument, he challenges the Judge\u2019s interpretation of his denials of those loans. This \nchallenge relates back to the reason why the Judge\u2019s initial decision was remanded. In his first \ndecision, the Judge concluded, \u201cApplicant\u2019s admitted debt delinquencies negate the need for any \nindependent proof.\u201d Judge\u2019s Initial Decision at 8. The Board ruled that conclusion was in error \nbecause Applicant\u2019s SOR response denied the student loan allegations with explanations and the \nGovernment remained obligated to prove those controverted debts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nIn the Remand Decision, the Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s denial of the student loans by \nconcluding: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nQualified denials (whether made under oath or not) to pleading allegations \nin an SOR can be considered as admitted facts that can be weighed along with other \nevidence developed during the hearing and in post-hearing proceedings.  Pleadings \nin ISCR proceedings and in federal and state courts in general serve a very important \npurpose of narrowing the issues open to evidentiary proof. Because Applicant\u2019s \ndenials of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b and 1.d in his SOR response incorporate his attached \nexplanations of the alleged delinquent student loans, his denials cannot be considered \nunqualified denials eligible for acceptance and consideration under the exculpatory \nno doctrine recognized in certain situations by DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board. See ISCR \nCase No. 94-1137, at 4 (March 27, 1996) and compare with DISCR Case No. 89\u00ad\n0589 at 4 (App. Bd. May 31, 1990)1 Applicant\u2019s debts in issue are fully documented \nand create some judgment issues. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. \n24, 2004).  [Remand Decision at 9.] \nIn his current brief, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion regarding \u201cqualified denials\u201d and \nnotes the Government offered no additional evidence on remand to prove the controverted student \nloans. He argues the Judge\u2019s reliance on the \u201cexplanations\u201d accompanying his denial of the student \nloans still did not prove those debts.  We do not find this argument persuasive.2 \nIn the paragraph quoted above, the Judge concluded the \u201cdebts in issue are fully \ndocumented[.]\u201d Applicant\u2019s argument fails to take into consideration other record evidence proving \nthe alleged student loans, particularly the four credit reports admitted into evidence (Government \nExhibits (GE) 3-5 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) M) as well as Applicant\u2019s disclosures in his security \nclearance application and background interview of having delinquent student loans (GE 1 and 2), \nhis testimony about signing a student loan application (Tr. at 66 and 69-70), and his testimony about \nthe Government\u2019s collection efforts for those loans (Tr. at 71-86, 89-90, 96, and 119-126 and \nApplicant\u2019sExhibits (AE)B-Land N-Q).3 Of note, credit reports aregenerallysufficient to establish \nthe Government\u2019s prima facie case of Guideline F security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18\u00ad\n00552 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2019). From our review of the record evidence, the Judge\u2019s material \nfindings regarding the student loans are based on substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence \nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \n1 In the past, some Federal circuit courts recognized the \u201cexculpatory no doctrine\u201d as a possible defense to a \ncharge of making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. In the cases cited by the Judge, the Appeal Board concluded \nthat doctrine was no defense to an applicant\u2019s falsification of a security clearance application. In Brogan v. United \nStates, 522 U.S. 398, 408 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the application of the \u201cexculpatory no doctrine\u201d in \nprosecutions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001. We do not see how that doctrine or the cited Appeal Board cases have any \napplication in interpreting Applicant\u2019s denial of the student loans.   \n2 We agree with Chief Department Counsel\u2019s reply brief argument that Applicant has apparently misinterpreted \nthe Appeal Board\u2019s reason for remanding the Judge\u2019s initial decision to mean the Government had failed to meet its \nburden of proof below.  Reply Brief at 8.   \n3 Applicant basically testified that he was responsible for one consolidated loan that combined the three alleged \nstudent loans (Tr. at 121-122) but he did not agree with amounts of the alleged loans. \n4 \n\nWeighing of the Evidence \nAmount of the Alleged Student Loans \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Once the student loans were proven, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns arising from them. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nWe recognize that an applicant\u2019s explanation accompanying a denial of an SOR allegation \nmay, depending on its nature and content, constitute an admission of facts at issue. In this case, the \nJudge stated that \u201cApplicant denied all of the Guideline F allegations covering his debts with \nexplanations.\u201d Decision at 3, emphasis added. That statement is incorrect. Applicant annotated the \nSOR by noting \u201cI deny with explanation\u201d for two of the alleged student loans and simply annotated \n\u201cI deny\u201d for the third. SOR Response. His denials are subject to various interpretations. Other than \nnoting that Applicant acknowledged the Government was withholding his Social Security benefits \nto repay the loans, the Judge did not identify specific facts that Applicant\u2019s SOR explanations may \nhave established. Even though the Judge may have erred in his interpretation of the \u201cqualified \ndenials,\u201d it was a harmless error because it likely had no impact on the outcome of the case given \nthe other evidence noted in the previous paragraph proving the three student loans. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-01181 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 30, 2018). \nApplicant argues the Judge did not explain why the student loans totaled about $117,000 \nwhen AE P listed two of the debts showing a balance of about $78,670. Based on the facts in this \ncase, there was no need for the Judge to explain the difference between those two amounts. The \nJudge found that two of the student loans totaling about $78,100 were consolidated and were subject \nto a Department of Treasury collection action that involved the withholding of Applicant\u2019s social \nsecurity benefits.  This collection action did not address the third established student loan that was \nalleged to be about $39,100. Furthermore, contrary to Applicant\u2019s contentions, neither Department \nCounsel nor the Judge were required to explain how the amounts owed on the student loans were \ncalculated or why the loans increased by a certain amount over a specific period. The amount of a \ndebt listed in a credit report may change over time due to voluntary or involuntary debtor payments, \nthe accumulation of interest, the imposition of fees or penalties, and similar actions. In DOHA \nproceedings, the Government is entitled to rely on information contained in credit reports and is \nunder no obligation to corroborate or verify the accuracy of that information before presenting it, \nalthough that information remains subject to an applicant\u2019s opportunity to present evidence in \nrebuttal, mitigation, or explanation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08925 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, \n2008).     \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. He first asserts that his failure to make payments on the student loans did not justify the \nJudge in finding \u201cbad faith\u201d in the following finding: \u201cStill unclear is why he could not help [. . . \nhis child] with payment on the loans that he was individually responsible for while he was gainfully \nemployed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from Remand Decision at 4. In challenging that finding, he \nargues there is no evidence of \u201cbad faith.\u201d This argument lacks merit. The Judge made no finding \nof bad-faith. Similarly, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s related conclusion that the Government\u2019s \n5 \n\nConclusion \nConditional Clearance Request \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \naction of withholding Applicant\u2019s social securitybenefits were not sufficient to establish a good-faith \neffort to repay the loans. This challenge establishes no error. As we have previously stated, the \nsatisfaction of a debt through involuntary collection efforts, such as a garnishment or attachment, is \nnot the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-03122 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018).  A conclusion that an applicant failed to prove \nthat he or she is adhering to a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay a debt does not equate to a conclusion that \nhe or she was acting in \u201cbad-faith,\u201d which implies some form of impropriety.  \nIn his arguments, Applicant also highlights that his deceased wife had managed the family\u2019s \nfinances and that he relied on her and his child to make the payments on the student loans.  When \nhis wife passed away, Applicant was overwhelmed and did not focus on making the payments. He \nargues that, given these circumstances, his failure to make the student loan payments was \nunderstandable. He also points out the Government pursued collection efforts for those loans for \nyears without him raising any objections or creating any problems, and he has expressed a \nwillingness to refinance his home to pay the loans. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to \ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nIn his brief, Applicant requests that, if the collection process is to continue, he be given an \nopportunity to make payments or that he be permitted to refinance his home or sell it to pay off the \ndebts.  He conditions this request on the Government determining the full amount of the debt and \nexplaining how it was calculated. DOHA is not a debt collection agency and has no authority or \nresponsibility to perform the debt verification action that Applicant is requesting. To the extent he \nis requesting the Appeal Board grant him a conditional security clearance under Directive, Encl. 2, \nApp. C, his request is denied.  He has failed to show that he has taken sufficient voluntary actions \nto resolve the student loans to warrant the granting of a conditional security clearance.  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline F were not \nraised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed below. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact \nApplicant, who was born in Sudan, works for a defense contractor. He came to the United \nStates in the early 2000s and became a U.S. citizen about five years later. All of his family members \nlive in Sudan. This includes his wife, siblings, half-siblings, and parents-in-law, all of whom are \ncitizens of Sudan. His father passed away several years ago and his mother passed away about two \nand half years ago. Prior to his mother\u2019s passing, Applicant spoke twice a month to a brother who \ncared for her.  Another brother served in a senior position in a Sudanese government ministry but \nretired several years ago. His sister is a former high-level official in the Sudanese government. \nBetween 2010 and early 2020, Applicant made four trips to Sudan that ranged in length from a \ncouple of months to four or five months. He has not spoken to his siblings since expressing \ncondolences following his mother\u2019s passing. One of his half-siblings is an official with a Sudanese \ngovernment ministry.  He has little or no contact with his half-siblings.  \nApplicant has been married for about seven years. They have no living children. He \nprovides his wife monthly financial support. \u201cHe retained the services of an immigration lawyer \nwho, as of October 2020, anticipated filing an immigration petition soon despite the current \nrestriction of immigration from Sudan.\u201d Decision at 3. Applicant has no business, financial, or \nproperty interests in Sudan. He does not own a home in the United States and uses a friend\u2019s address \nas his current residence.  He votes in the U.S. elections.  \nIn 2019, the Sudanese government was overthrown and the transition to a new government \nhas not been entirely peaceful. In 1993, Sudan was designed a State Sponsor of Terrorism, but it was \nremoved from that list in December 2020. This removal allows the United States to provide more \n\u201crobust support\u201d to Sudan.  Decision at 4.  Sudan has a poor human-rights record. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Analysis \nThe evidence presented establishes Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) and 7(b). Applicant \nappears to be responsible, cooperative, and truthful. After considering the geopolitical situation in \nSudan, the Judge concluded: \nThe entirety of [Applicant\u2019s] family ties are to Sudan while he has no family ties to \nthe United States.  At the same time there appear to be no circumstances regarding \nApplicant personally that give rise to doubt about his suitability for a security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance, but that by itself does not carry sufficient weight. \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude that it is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of the United States and the interests of the Sudanese government or his \nfamily members who are citizens and residents in Sudan. Likewise, I cannot \nconclude that there is no conflict of interest.  [Mitigating Conditions] 8(a) and 8(b) \nare not fully applicable.  [Decision at 7.]   \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. He argues, for example, that the Judge failed to consider that he has provided \nservices to the U.S. military oversees since 2017, that significant steps have been taken to further his \nwife\u2019s immigration to the United States, and that he has not had contact with his siblings since \nshortly after his mother\u2019s passing. The Judge, however, made findings about those matters. None \nof his arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence \nin the record or enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s brief also presents arguments based on Guideline B Hearing Office decisions \ninvolving another country. His reliance on those decisions is misplaced. Those decisions rest upon \nparticular factual circumstances that do not establish any precedent and are distinguishable from the \ncase under review. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-00327 at 2 (App. Bd. May 20, 2020)(decisions by \nHearing Office Judges are not legally binding precedent on the Appeal Board or other Judges). Each \ncase must be decided on its own merits. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). In general, each case \npresents unique facts and circumstances. As an example of this latter point, the nature of a \nparticular foreign government involved in a foreign influence case is a key consideration because \nit provides context for other record evidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate \nconclusions in the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, 2017).  In an \nappeal of a Guideline B case, how a Hearing Judge may have decided another case involving a \ndifferent applicant with a different background and contacts in a different foreign country is not a \nrelevant consideration. The Hearing Office decisions cited in this appeal brief do not establish any \nreason for concluding the Judge erred in this case. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.  The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Department Counsel requested a hearing. \nOn June 10, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant submitted documentary \nevidence that was not included in the record and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we remand the case to the Judge. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains matters from outside the record, which we are generally \nprecluded from considering. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. We will, however, consider new evidence insofar \nas it bears upon questions of due process or jurisdiction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01472 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). \nAt the hearing, the Judge left the record open until May 21, 2021, for Applicant to submit \nadditional matters. Tr. at 71-72 and 77-78. In the decision, the Judge noted Applicant did not \nsubmit any additional matters. In his appeal brief, Applicant contends that he submitted matters on \nMay 20, 2021.  \nIn resolving cases in which applicants claim to have submitted documents that were not \nreceived, we generally examine the record and the briefs to see whether there is any support for this \nclaim. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03712 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2018). At the hearing, the Judge \nasked Applicant if he had any character reference letters or pictures of awards that he could send to \nhim. Applicant said he would provide those matters. Tr. at 69-72. We note Applicant\u2019s brief \ncontains two character reference letters that were prepared shortlybefore the post-hearing submission \ndeadline. It also contains pictures of employment awards that he indicated he would provide to the \nJudge. These documents tend to support Applicant\u2019s claim that he submitted matters the Judge did \nnot receive. \nBased on the above, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge \nto reopen the record to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. As provided \nin Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge shall, upon remand, issue a new decision in the case. The Board \nretains no continuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a decision issued after \nremand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. to E3.1.35.

The Judge\u2019s favorable finding was not raised as an issue on \nappeal. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her analysis \nof the tax-related allegations and whether the Judge was biased against Applicant. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his sixties, is married, and has adult children.  He has worked for a Federal \ncontractor since 2005 and also works part-time in a self-employed status. His wife serves as an \nofficer for two companies. Between 2005 and 2011, they experienced family health issues that \nimpacted their finances. Due to those issues, they began having difficulties making mortgage \npayments in 2008. In 2013, they applied for mortgage relief to have their payments reduced, but \nit was not as helpful as they expected. Through an attorney, they unsuccessfully attempted to \nrenegotiate their mortgage loan.  \nApplicant and his wife hired another attorney who negotiated a \u201ccash for keys\u201d resolution \nin which they received $4,500 in cash, while the mortgage company received the property and \nagreed to waive the deficient mortgage balance of over $272,000. Applicant admitted to the best \nof his recollection that he lived in the house for approximately three years without paying the \nmortgage or homeowner\u2019s fees until the transaction was finalized in 2019. Applicant reported this \nissue to his facility security officer at that time.  He now rents a home. \nAs a successful businessperson with experience in financial matters, Applicant\u2019s wife was \nresponsible for filing their Federal income tax returns. In an affidavit, Applicant wife stated that \nshe filed their tax returns in paper form without issue from 2001 to 2012. In 2013, she began using \nan electronic program to prepare and file their returns. She claimed she prepared and filed their \ntax return for 2013-2018. She noted Applicant would inquire \u201chow it was going and if I needed \nanything.\u201d Decision at 3, quoting from Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. On the other hand, \u201c[h]e \ntestified that he never inquired about whether their tax returns were timely filed.\u201d Decision at 3.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAt some point the IRS informed them that information in its possession indicated they owed taxes \nfor 2013.  She also later found out the IRS had not received their 2015-2018 tax returns. \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in June 2017, he \ndisclosed that he failed to pay his income taxes for 2013, was disputing the amount the IRS claimed \nhe owed, and hired an accountant to determine the amount owed. According to his tax transcript \nfor 2013, the IRS received his tax return in December 2014. He originally received a tax refund \nfor 2013. In April 2016, the IRS issued him a notice for an additional assessment. In May 2016, \nhe was assessed an amount of about $29,900 for unreported income as well as interest and \npenalties, and he appointed the accountant as his representative.  The IRS sent him another notice \nin July 2017 and again in November 2018. \nIn March 2019, Applicant established an installment agreement to pay the past-due taxes.  \nHe failed to make payments under that agreement between March and June 2020. Applicant \ntestified he stopped making payment on the advice of his accountant because delinquent tax returns \nwere ready to be filed and they would automatically trigger a stoppage. Another plan would then \nhave to be negotiated with the IRS to address the newly calculated amount owed.   \nIn June 2020, the IRS received Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax returns for 2015-2018. He \nowes a tax liability, including interests and penalties, of approximately $55,000 for 2015, $22,900 \nfor 2016, $7,900 for 2017, and $8,300 for 2018. He also had a tax liability of $8,400 for 2019. \nHe has paid his 2018 and 2019 tax liability.  As of June 2021, he owed a total Federal tax liability \nof about $115,200.   \nIn January 2021, Applicant hired another accountant who is a tax expert. This accountant \ntestified that the IRS notices would have been sent to his last known address, which may have been \nthe \u201ccash for keys\u201d property. In May and June 2021, Applicant made payments, while his \naccountant began negotiating another payment plan. Shortly after the hearing, Applicant provided \nconfirmation of a new installment plan in which he would make monthly payments of about $1,750 \nfor 72 months. Due to the amount owed, a tax lien would be filed once the payment plan \ncommenced.  \nApplicant testified that his wife never told him they owed taxes for 2013 and 2015-2017. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit did not explain why, if she timely filed the federal tax returns as she \nstated, she and Applicant failed to pay the taxes when due as required.\u201d Decision at 6. \u201cBased on \nall of the evidence, I did not find Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s vague and incomplete explanations credible.  \nRegardless of whether Applicant was aware of the extent of their tax problems, he is equally \nresponsible for ensuring his tax returns are filed on time and the taxes paid.\u201d Id. at 9. He \nexperienced conditions beyond his control, but did not act responsibly. \u201cIt is not believable that \nhe never inquired whether they were to receive a refund or owe taxes each year considering they \nwere going through serious financial issues regarding their ability to pay their mortgage. The fact \nthat he says he was unaware of what was happening does not absolve him of this legal duties.\u201d Id. \nVarious mitigating conditions apply or partially apply but Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his alleged financial problems. \nDiscussion \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred by \u201cimputing [to him] per se \naccountability for [his wife\u2019s] shortcomings\u201d in failing to file and pay their taxes. Appeal Brief at \n2. He argues that \u2018he reasonably entrusted [her] for over a decade or more to prepare and timely \nfile the family\u2019s tax returns,\u201d but she failed to ensure their tax returns were filed as required for \n2013 and 2015 and 2018. Id. He asserts that he was unaware of the tax deficiencies until he hired \nthe first accountant who obtained his IRS tax transcripts and reported the problems. Id. at 6. He \ncharacterizes the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was \u201cequally responsible for ensuring his tax \nreturns are filed on time and taxes are paid\u201d as a \u201cbright line rule, which is not supported by the \nGuidelines, renders the Guideline F mitigating conditions and the Whole Person considerations \nthat, among other things, requires analysis of [Applicant\u2019s] personal culpability in his wife\u2019s \nfailures, meaningless.\u201d Id. at 9. We do not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive. \nIn responding to the SOR in November 2019, Applicant admitted in part and denied in part \nthe three tax-related allegations. For the tax-filing allegation, he stated he was \u201cnow aware\u201d that \nhis \u201ctaxes for some years were not filed.\u201d For the delinquent tax allegations, he admitted he owed \npast-due taxes for 2013 and 2016 but was uncertain of the actual amounts owed for those years. \nHis IRS tax transcripts for the years at issue establish he did not file his tax returns or pay his taxes \nas required. Government Exhibit (GE) 4 and Applicant Exhibit (AE) K. The record contains \nsufficient evidence, as the Judge concluded, to establish Disqualifying Conditions 19(a), inability \nto satisfy debts, 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations, and 19(f), failure to file . . . \nannual Federal . . . income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as \nrequired.\u201d  Decision at 8, quoting from Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).  \nOnce the facts in an SOR allegation are proved, an applicant is then responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those facts and has the \nultimate burden to persuasion in obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. In \nthis case, the Judge\u2019s conclusions do not establish, as Applicant contends, that he was \u201cper se \naccountability for [his wife\u2019s] shortcomings\u201d but instead are just a determination that he failed to \nmeet his burdens of production and persuasion to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nproven tax problems. \nIndividuals are required to file and pay their Federal taxes on time. Under the adjudicative \nguidelines, an applicant cannot abdicate that responsibility by merely claiming someone else was \nperforming those functions for him or her. Whether an applicant acted responsibly by having his \nor her spouse or a third-party perform those functions depends upon the circumstances of the case. \nAs a general proposition, an applicant\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable oversight of his or her tax \nobligations is a sufficient basis to prompt skepticism about his or her judgment or attentiveness in \nmatters of importance. In cases of this nature, the key issue is often when did Applicant know or \nreasonably should have known his or her spouse or the third-party was failing to perform the \nrequired functions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-00789 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2014) and ISCR \nCase No. 18-02914 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2020). \nIn this case, Applicant disclosed in his SCA of June 2017 that he owed approximately \n$25,000 in delinquent taxes for 2013, he had not filed or paid his taxes for 2016, and he hired an \naccountant to help him with his tax issues.

At that point, Applicant should have taken responsible steps \nnot only to resolve those problems but also to ensure he was in compliance with his future tax \nrequirements. He failed to do so. The evidence establishes that, after submission of his SCA, he \ndid not file his tax returns for 2015-2018 until June 20201 and he continued to incur tax \ndelinquencies for 2017 and 2018. Additionally, he did not establish the first IRS payment plan \nuntil March 2019, did not make consistent payments under that plan, did not make any payments \nunder a second IRS payment plan that was in existence from September to December 2020, and \ndid not establish the third IRS payment plan until after the hearing. AE K and T. These facts \nneither support his claim that he was not responsible for his recurring tax deficiencies nor support \nhis claim that he acted responsibly in addressing those deficiencies. \nApplicant argues that his most recent IRS payment plan merits the application of Mitigating \nCondition 20(g), the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file \nor pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. Directive, Encl. 2, App. \nA \u00b6 20(g).  The Judge concluded that, even though Mitigating Condition 20(g) applied, Applicant \nhad not mitigated the Guideline F security concerns, noting he still owes a substantial tax debt and \nhas not yet established a financial track record of compliance. Applicant has failed to establish \nthat conclusion was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nApplicant also argues the Judge demonstrated a \u201clack objectivity towards [him] and his \nwife\u201d and had an \u201cinflexible position\u201d about whether he or his wife were telling the truth. Appeal \nBrief at 11 and 12. He further contends the Judge concluded that either he or his wife was lying \nbefore hearing all the evidence. Id. at 13. The Appeal Board is required to give deference to a \nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. A party challenging a credibility \ndetermination has a heavy burden on appeal. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 8, 2005). Furthermore, it would be error for a Judge to accept uncritically a witness\u2019s \ntestimony or an individual\u2019s affidavit without considering whether that information is plausible \nand consistent with other evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, \n2015). Based on our review of the record, we find no basis for concluding the Judge prejudged \nthe evidence and no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. To the extend \nApplicant is claiming the Judge lacked impartiality, we do not find that argument convincing. \nApplicant has not directed our attention to anything in the record that would likely persuade a \nreasonable person that the Judge had an inflexible predisposition or lacked impartiality. In short, \nhe has failed to meet the heavy burden on him to rebut the presumption that a Judge is impartial \nand unbiased.  See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph D. Jordan, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nOctober 4, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn December 10, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant has an associate\u2019s, bachelor\u2019s, and master\u2019s degree.  Married, she has four children,\nthree of whom live with her.  She has served in the military, and during a deployment to the Middle\nEast was subjected to hostile fire.  She has held a security clearance for over 20 years.\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged that she had failed to file in a timely manner her Federal income\ntax returns for 2011 through 2017; State A returns for 2011 through 2016; and State B returns for\n2017.  In addition, the SOR alleged delinquent tax obligations and nine other delinquent debts.  The\nJudge found in Applicant\u2019s favor on all allegations except her failure to have filed Federal returns\nand the returns due to State A.  \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to several events that were beyond her control. \nFor example, two of her children were hospitalized for mental health problems; her husband\nexperienced unemployment and underemployment and also had mental health difficulties requiring\nboth inpatient and outpatient treatment; Applicant and her husband were separated for several years;\nApplicant had disruptions in income due to changes in employment; and another family, as well as\nher mother, moved in with her due to necessity.  Applicant attributed her tax filing delinquencies to\nher husband\u2019s mental health problems, insofar as tax return preparation was his responsibility and\nhe failed to follow through.  At the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant that her tax filing issues\nwere the key factor in her case.  He requested that she provide evidence concerning when she was\nnotified of her filing deficiencies and what she did about them.  Decision at 8.  She did not provide\nany evidence beyond a statement from her husband that did not admit responsibility for Applicant\u2019s\nproblems.\nApplicant did not file her delinquent returns until after she had completed her security\nclearance application and had undergone her clearance interview.  Her mitigation evidence failed to\nshow that she acted promptly in resolving her tax filing delinquencies.  These delinquencies suggest\nthat Applicant may be lacking in judgment, trustworthiness, or the ability to follow rules and\nregulations.  \n2\n\nDiscussion\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief argues that the Judge failed properly to weigh the evidence,\nincluding circumstances beyond her control that affected her financial condition and the steps she\nhas taken to resolve her problems.  She also notes that the last time she failed to file her tax\ndocuments on time was several years ago and that she has filed in a timely manner since then. \nHowever, we have noted that unresolved debts are ongoing  and therefore recent, for purposes of\nsecurity clearance determinations.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018). \nSimilar reasoning applies in cases of late tax filings.  Applicant knew of these problems for about\ntwo years before taking action to resolve them.  In a DOHA proceeding, the applicant is charged with\npresenting evidence in mitigation of the concerns raised in his or her SOR and bears the ultimate\nburden of persuasion.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that she did not provide evidence\nexplaining her dilatory filings is consistent with the record that was before him.  A disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence or an ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of\nthe record is not sufficient to show that a Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are not enough to show that the Judge erred in his analysis.\n  \nApplicant cites to several Hearing Office cases in support of her effort to obtain a favorable\nresult.  However, each case must be decided on its own merits.  Inevitable factual variances among\ndecisions involving different applicants substantially diminishes their relevance.  See, e.g,.

Duffy\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board  \nDISSENTING OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE JAMES F. DUFFY\nThe Judge\u2019s decision should be remanded due to analytical errors, such as his failure to\naddress key mitigating factors, i.e., the related concepts of recency  and reform & rehabilitation.  \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant raises these issues by highlighting that her last failure to file income\n2\n1\ntaxes properly was for tax year 2015, which was more than four years prior to the issuance of the\nSOR.  Appeal Brief at 7.   \nIn analyzing Applicant\u2019s tax filing deficiencies, the Judge focused on the amount of time she\ntook to file the delinquent returns.  While the timing of corrective action was an important factor for\nthe Judge to consider, it was not the only factor that warranted consideration in this case.  Directive\n\u00b6 6.3 provides that \u201c[e]ach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\n1 Directive \u00b6\u00b6 6.3.2 provides the \u201crecency of the conduct\u201d must be evaluated appropriately.  See also Directive,\nEncl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(d)(3).\n2  The concept of the \u201crecency\u201d is addressed in Mitigating Condition 20(a), i.e. \u201cthe behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d  Reform and rehabilitation are more general\nconcepts implicit in various mitigating conditions.  See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(g).  See also Directive\n\u00b6 6.3.5, which provides each clearance decision must be based on, as appropriate, the \u201c[a]bsence or presence of\nrehabilitation[;]\u201d Id. at Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(d), which lists the whole-person factors of \u201c(6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other behavior changes;\u201d and \u201c(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence [of the conduct at\nissue];\u201d and Id. at Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(f)(5), which sets forth the adjudication factor whether the applicant \u201chas\ndemonstrated positive changes in behavior[.]\u201d\n4\n\ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2[.]\u201d  See also ISCR Case No. 03-04172 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJun. 7, 2005)(\u201cA Judge must apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines.\u201d).  The\npertinent mitigating conditions or factors to be applied, of course, depend on the facts of the case. \n    \nThe Directive is silent on what constitutes a sufficient period of reform and rehabilitation. \nThis silence does not relieve a Judge of the obligation to construe and apply pertinent provisions of\nthe Directive in a reasonable, common sense way.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-11810 at 4 (App. Bd.\nJune 5, 2003).  The Board has consistently stated the length of time needed to demonstrate reform\nand rehabilitation must be based on a reasoned analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case. \nThe Board has also repeatedly held that if the record evidence shows that a significant period of time\nhas passed without evidence of recurrence of the alleged security-significant conduct, then the Judge\nmust articulate a rational basis for concluding why that significant period of time does not\ndemonstrate changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or\nrehabilitation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 7 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004); ISCR Case No.\n02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004); and ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nIn this decision, the Judge found against Applicant on two allegations.  These asserted she\nfailed, as required, to file her Federal income tax returns for 2011 through 2017 and her state income\ntax returns for 2011 through 2016.  The evidence shows the number of years that Applicant failed\nto file her tax returns properly was less than alleged.  The Judge found that Applicant filed her 2012\nFederal tax return about two months late and filed her Federal tax returns for 2014 and 2016 through\n2018 on time.   Decision at 4 and 7.  In admitting the state tax filing allegation, Applicant explained\nthat, when she contacted state tax authorities, they informed her all of her state tax returns had been\nfiled with the exception of tax years 2013 and 2015.  SOR Response at 3.  In the decision, the Judge\n3\nconcluded that \u201c[s]he [eventually] filed all required tax returns\u201d (Decision at 12), which given when\nthe record closed would have apparently included her 2019 Federal and state income tax returns.  \nIn this regard, the Judge made no adverse findings or conclusions concerning Applicant\u2019s filing of\nher Federal or state income tax returns for the last four completed tax years (2016-2019). \n4\n3 In responding to interrogatories, Applicant reported that she filed her Federal and state income tax returns for\n2014, 2016, and 2017 about a month or two late.  Government Exhibit (GE) 2 at 22 and 27.  Such minor tax filing delays\nare generally not a matter of security significance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd. Sep. 6,\n2019)(minor tax filing delays do not raise security concerns).  In her interrogatories, Applicant also provided IRS tax\ntranscripts that reflect she filed her 2014, 2016, and 2017 Federal income tax returns on time.  GE 2 at 39, 45, and 47. \nThe incongruity between Applicant\u2019s interrogatory responses and the IRS tax transcripts about the filing dates apparently\noccurred because she was confusing the \u201creceived date\u201d and the \u201cprocessing date\u201d on the tax transcripts.  Her\nmisreporting of those filing dates by about a month or so in responding to the interrogatories appears to be the only\nevidence in the record supporting that portion of the SOR allegations asserting she failed to file, as required, her Federal\nand state income tax returns for 2014, 2016, and 2017.  Consequently, portions of the SOR allegations were apparently\nbased upon Applicant\u2019s innocent mistakes in responding to the interrogatories.\n4  The hearing was held on October 30, 2020, and record closed on November 13, 2020.  Decision at 2.  At the\nhearing, Applicant testified that all of her Federal taxes were filed (Tr. at 29.  See also SOR Response at 9) and that she\nwas up-to-date on her Federal and state taxes (Tr. at 71).  No record evidence shows otherwise.    \n5\n\nIt also merits noting that Applicant\u2019s case is distinguishable from Appeal Board decisions\nthat the Judge cites regarding the issue of the timing of corrective action.  For example, the Judge\u2019s\ndecision contains the following quote from ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017):\nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating\nan applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who begins to resolve\nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in\njeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations\nover time or when there is no immediate threat to his own interests.  In this case,\nApplicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax returns for 2009-2014 after submitting\nhis SCA [security clearance application], undergoing his background interview, or\nreceiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action might otherwise merit.\n[Emphasis added.  Decision at 13-14.]  \nThe facts in Applicant\u2019s case, however, are different from that case.  Applicant\u2019s last established tax\nfiling deficiency occurred more than a full tax year before the initiation of the adjudicative process\nthat started when she submitted her latest security clearance application in August 2017.  In other\nwords, Applicant began correcting the alleged behavior by filing her 2016 tax returns on time before\nshe was placed on notice her security clearance was in jeopardy.  Contrary to the SOR allegations,\nshe also filed her 2017 tax returns in a timely manner.  No evidence reflects that Applicant initiated\ncorrective action due to external pressure or coercion.  Instead, such action appears to have been\ntaken in good-faith.  In analyzing Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge did not address this meaningful\ndistinction from the above quoted Appeal Board decision. \nThe Judge also cites ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016) and ISCR Case\nNo. 15-03481 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016) regarding the timing of corrective action.  For the\nreasons stated in the previous paragraph, those decisions are likewise distinguishable from\nApplicant\u2019s case.   In the decision, the Judge concluded \u201cthe primary problem here relates to the\ntiming of Applicant\u2019s filing of her federal and state income tax returns.\u201d  Decision at 16.   In short,\nthe Judge\u2019s primary reason for denying Applicant\u2019s security clearance appears to be based in large\npart on Appeal Board decisions that are distinguishable from Applicant\u2019s case without any\nexplanation for why those decisions should apply in her case.  By quoting and citing those decisions\nwithout distinguishing them from Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge\u2019s decision inaccurately creates the\nimpression that Applicant\u2019s corrective action was initiated after her security clearance was placed\nin jeopardy.\n5\nDelays in taking corrective action are not per se disqualifying but are merely a factor to\nconsider with other pertinent adjudicative factors.  Applicant\u2019s delays in taking corrective action\nshould have been considered together with the length of time that passed since her last tax filing\n5 Additionally, the Judge cites ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) and ISCR Case No. 12-\n05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014), but those cases are distinguishable from Applicant\u2019s because they involve the filing\nof tax returns after the IRS instituted tax liens and garnishment actions.  \n6\n\ndelinquency and all other relevant evidence to determine whether the alleged behavior was behind\nher.6\nGiven that four completed tax years elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last tax filing delinquency, the\nJudge erred in failing to address whether that significant period warranted a finding of reform and\nrehabilitation.  The Judge also erred in an apparent misapplication of Appeal Board precedent on a \nkey issue.  These errors leave sufficient doubt as to whether they had an impact on the outcome of\nthe case.  The decision should have been remanded for the Judge to correct these errors.  \nSigned: James F. Duffy             \nJames F. Duffy\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\n6  The Judge\u2019s other favorable findings\u2014such as Applicant\u2019s husband was the one who filed their taxes online\nwithout the need for her signature; that she and her husband were separated from 2010 to 2016; that she did not learn\nof the tax filing deficiencies until 2016 or 2017, possibly July or August 2017; that she filed her delinquent Federal tax\nreturns before she responded to the DOHA interrogatories and the SOR; and that she encountered difficulties obtaining\ndocumentation regarding her state taxes from a former employer because that company had been sold\u2014also should have\nbeen factored into the mitigation analysis. \n7\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph D. Jordan, Esq.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On\nNovember 15, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn October 7, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\ncontained errors and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns in a timely\nmanner for tax years 2010 and 2013 through 2018; that he failed to file his state income tax returns\nin a timely manner for tax years 2010 through 2018; and that he owed tax debts both to the IRS and\nto his state.  Applicant attributed his tax problems to marital difficulties.  His now ex-wife left him\nin 2010, securing a decree of divorce in 2016.  The divorce decree imposed child support obligations\nof over $2,000 on Applicant, which he was not successful in getting reduced.  He claimed that the\nstress of his marital problems resulted in him forgetting to file his tax returns.  He further stated that\nhis delay in filing was due in part to his having to obtain documentation that was in storage and to\nfailure by his tax preparers.  Applicant also advised that he provided financial support to his parents,\nwho had medical problems.  In his clearance interview, \u201cApplicant said he did not timely file his tax\nreturns because he did not want to pay the government.\u201d  In addition, when the interviewer drew his\nattention to his delinquent returns for 2015 and 2016, Applicant stated that he would file them \u201cthis\nmonth.\u201d  Decision at 3, 5.  He did not file the returns until a year later.  \nApplicant has entered into payment plans with the IRS and with his state.  Applicant has not\nbeen totally consistent in his payments.  For example, he did not have an IRS approved payment plan\nfrom June 2017 until 2019.  Nevertheless, the Judge stated that he \u201chas taken important steps toward\nshowing his financial responsibility . . . and [has] made substantial progress in addressing his tax\ndebt.\u201d  Decision at 10.  Applicant\u2019s professional colleagues describe him as honest, reliable,\ntrustworthy, and one who has contributed to his employers\u2019 success.\nIn his analysis, the Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s marital problems, his child support obligations,\nand to his  parents\u2019 medical problems.  He stated that these things are circumstances beyond\nApplicant\u2019s control.  He also cited to evidence that Applicant has filed his delinquent tax returns and\nhas made a meaningful effort to repay his tax obligations.  However, he also cited to evidence that\nApplicant made only three payments to the federal government in 2019.\nThe Judge noted Applicant\u2019s contention that he forgot about filing his federal and state tax\nreturns due to the stress of his personal circumstances, concluding that this explanation was not\npersuasive, in light of the extended period of time over which these delinquencies occurred.  He cited\n2\n\nto Appeal Board cases to the effect that even if an applicant has corrected his tax problems, a Judge\nmay still consider the security significance of longstanding behavior.  The Judge stated that the\nprimary problem in Applicant\u2019s case is the timing of his remedial efforts.  Applicant was on notice\nthat he should file his returns and resolve his tax debts at least as of the date of his clearance\ninterview.  However, Applicant did not file returns for 2015 and 2016 for an entire year following\nthe interview.  All in all, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to have begun addressing his\nproblems earlier on impugned his judgment and reliability.\nDiscussion\nApplicant denies that he told his clearance interviewer that he had not filed his returns\nbecause he did not want to pay the government.  He claims that he challenged the inclusion of this\nstatement in the interview summary, but it made its way into the record anyhow.  We find this\nargument persuasive.  In his response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant stated that the interview\nsummary, part of a DoD report of investigation (ROI), was not accurate in several respects.  He\nsupplied corrections to the summary, which included explicit denials of having made the challenged\nstatement about not wanting to pay the government.  He certified that the interview summary was\naccurate only as amended.  Government Exhibit (GE) 2, Answers to Interrogatories, at 5-6, 24-25. \nThe challenged statement was not independently authenticated.  Accordingly, the finding is not\nsustainable, insofar as it was based upon evidence that was inadmissible under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20,\nwhich requires authentication of a DoD ROI.1  However, it does not appear to have exerted an\ninfluence on the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision, which relied more on the timing of Applicant\u2019s remedial\nefforts than on any other factor.  Therefore, this error is harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-\n02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nApplicant cites to evidence of circumstances outside his control that affected his tax\nproblems as well as to evidence that he has filed his tax returns and made significant efforts at paying\ndown his debts.  This was evidence that the Judge was bound to consider, along with all the other\nevidence in the record.  However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion about the timing of Applicant\u2019s remedial\nefforts is sustainable.  The mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment\narrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to issue a favorable decision\nunder Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(g).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29,\n2018).  To the contrary, a Judge may consider the timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his\nsecurity concerns, on the view that someone who is dilatory in addressing those concerns may be\nlacking in the judgment and reliability expected of those who hold security clearances.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  Applicant\u2019s arguments are not enough to\nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence or to show that the Judge\nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020).  We have given due consideration to the Hearing\nOffice cases that Applicant cites in his appeal brief.  However, Hearing Office decisions are not\n1Applicant did not object to the admission of GE 3, which we interpret to mean that he did not object to the\ndocument as amended.  Tr. at 11.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019).  The cited cases do\nnot undermine the Judge\u2019s adverse decision. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the\ndecision, both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.

Applicant requested a decision on the written record. After \nApplicant submitted a response to Department Counsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), the \nGovernment withdrew the Guideline F allegations. On May 25, 2021, after considering the record, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is of Lebanese descent, entered the United States in the late 1990s and \nbecame a U.S. citizen about nine years later. Divorced, he has no children. He has worked with U.S. \nforces in Iraq. After leaving Iraq without authorization to visit his ill mother in Lebanon, he was \nfired from that position. While a U.S. citizen, he obtained a Lebanese passport to visit a sibling in \nanother Middle Eastern country. In his 2018 security clearance application, he reported that he was \nthen living in Lebanon and had been doing so for about a year and a half.  Since then, he received \na bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in Lebanon.  \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant that he was a dual citizen of Lebanon and \nthe United States, that he maintained a bank account in Lebanon with a balance of about $4,000, that \nhis sibling was a citizen of Lebanon and a resident of another Middle Eastern country, that he has \na cousin who is a citizen and resident of Lebanon and who works for a government ministry, and that \nhe has close contact with three aunts and a cousin who are citizens and residents of Lebanon. When \nhe returned to Lebanon about six years ago, he has maintained weekly in-person contact with an \naunt. Lebanon has been plagued by corruption and human rights abuses. The Department of State \nadvises U.S. citizen to avoid travel in certain areas of Lebanon due to terrorism or potential violence. \n\u201cApplicant admits his close contact with his familyin Lebanon with whom he is bound by affection.\u201d \nDecision at 6. His foreign ties create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nexploitation, inducement, etc.  His decision to leave Iraq without authorization to visit his then ill \nmother in Lebanon reinforces the Government\u2019s concerns. He presented no information about his \nassets in the United States.  He has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was dismissed from a university for \ncheating on two examinations in 2015. Although he first denied cheating to the university, he later \nadmitted it after consulting with an attorney. He engaged in a pattern of dishonesty. Such conduct \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas not minor.  He has not mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in finding he lied to the \ninvestigator. This argument has merit. The Judge concluded, \u201cIn his subject interview [Applicant] \nlied to the investigator and stated that nothing came of the situation.\u201d Decision at 9, emphasis added. \nApplicant\u2019s summary of his background interview does not support a finding that he lied to the \ninvestigator about the cheating incidents alleged in the SOR. During that interview, Applicant \ndiscussed both of the alleged cheating incidents with the investigator and indicated he initiallydenied \ncheating to school officials about the first incident but later admitted to the officials that he did cheat. \nApplicant told the investigator that he was dismissed from the university for cheating. From our \nreview of the summary of the background interview, it appears the Judge erred by mixing unrelated \nincidents addressed in that interview. The phrase \u201cnothing came of it\u201d in the summary (Item 4, \nEnhanced Subject Interview at 6) that the Judge paraphrased in her analysis involved a suspected \ncheating incident at a different university that was unrelated to the cheating incidents alleged in the \nSOR. There is no basis for concluding Applicant lied to the investigator when he stated nothing \ncame of that unalleged incident.  \nWhile we recognize that a Judge\u2019s conclusion that an applicant lied to an investigator\u2014even \nwhen not alleged in the SOR\u2014is likely to have an impact on his or her weighing of the mitigating \nevidence, such an error here was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013). In responding to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted he was dismissed from a U.S. university for cheating on two examinations in \n2015. In a written statement, a professor at that university noted that he met with Applicant \u201con \nseveral occasions throughout spring semester to discuss academic dishonesty in [that course.]\u201d Item \n2 at 10. During the first alleged incident, Applicant met with the Dean, Associate Dean, and \nprofessor to discuss his suspected cheating on a quiz.  In that meeting, Applicant denied any form \nof academic dishonesty. About four days later, Applicant met again with the Associate Dean and \nthe professor to review security footage that showed Applicant was not in exam room when he was \nstill logged into a computer system as taking the test. An examination of the system did not \ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s assertion that a computer glitch made it appear he was working on the quiz \nwhen he was not present in the room with a proctor. At this second meeting, Applicant continued \nto deny any cheating. The next day Applicant requested a meeting with the professor, admitted \ncheating on the quiz, and indicated that it would not happen again.  He was required to retake the \nquiz even though he knew he would be assigned the grade of zero for it. A little over a month later, \ntwo professors observed Applicant cheating on the final exam for that course. They later met with \nApplicant who admitted cheating and pleaded for another chance. The evidence supports the Judge\u2019s \nconclusions that these cheating incidents are not minor and reflect a pattern of dishonesty. These \nincidents continue to raise doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.        \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. He argues, for example, that he does not have immediate family members residing in \nLebanon, that he traveled there to complete a college degree, and that he has safeguarded information \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the U.S. military in the past. None of his arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or sufficient to show that the \nJudge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Applicant asks if the Appeal Board can reach \nout to military personnel and his friends to inquire about his true character. We do not have \nauthority to conduct an additional investigation of an applicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0140 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2000).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision.

On \nDecember 17, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2013securityconcerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On May 12, 2021, after the \nhearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guidelines E and F \nare not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his sixties, was born in Sudan, where he attended college. The SOR \nallegations at issue in this case stated that Applicant has four siblings and a son who are citizens and \nresidents of Sudan. The SOR also alleged that Applicant has provided $7,000 to $8,000 in financial \nsupport yearly since 2009 to one of his siblings and about $3,000 yearly since 2005 to his son.1 The \nJudge also made findings regarding matters not alleged in the SOR, that (1) Applicant\u2019s wife is a \ncitizen and resident of Sudan; (2) Applicant provided $15,000 in support to his wife; (3) Applicant \ntraveled to Sudan numerous times; (4) Applicant falsely stated on a food stamp application that he \ndid not own a car; and (5) Applicant did not disclose part-time employment on the same application. \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for his duty performance, \u201calways plac[ing] the \nmission before himself.\u201d Decision at 7. His character references support his effort to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant has received a unit coin and certificate of appreciation for his \ncontributions to mission accomplishment.    \nSudan has experienced political instability in the past few years due to the overthrow of its \nPresident and the establishment of a transitional military counsel. There has been violence in \nKhartoum and other cities across Sudan, resulting in limitations on travel by U.S. Government \npersonnel. Sudan has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism, supporting international terrorist \nplots. Terrorist groups are active in Sudan and have stated an intent to harm westerners and western \ninterests.  \nThe SOR alleged contacts with other siblings in addition to those described in the above \nsummary of the Judge\u2019s findings. The Judge found that Applicant\u2019s contacts with these other \nsiblings were not sufficient to raise concerns. However, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s connections \nwith the four siblings referenced above and with his son, along with his financial support for them, \nraised security concerns that he concluded were not mitigated by the evidence Applicant presented. \nEven though Applicant\u2019s contact with these family members may not be frequent, the evidence as \na whole does not rebut the presumption that he has ties of affection for them. The Judge stated that \nhe considered the non-alleged conduct for such things as evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, his case \nfor mitigation, and in performing a whole-person analysis. Overall, the Judge concluded that \nApplicant had not met his burden of persuasion regarding mitigation. \nDiscussion \n. \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider significant record evidence that supports \nhis effort to obtain a clearance. He also argues that the Judge weighed the evidence inconsistently \nregarding his various siblings. Applicant\u2019s argument is, essentially, a disagreement with the manner \n1In his 2017 security clearance application ( SCA), Applicant stated that his most recent contacts with these four \nsiblings had been in 2014 and 2015. In a counterintelligence screening conducted a month later, he stated that he \ncommunicated with two of these siblings about 12 times a year and provided no information about contact with the other \ntwo.  Decision at 5.  See Government Exhibit (GE) 1, SCA, at 25-29 and GE 3, Counterintelligence Screening, at 1-2. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin which the Judge weighed the evidence, which is not enough to undermine the Judge\u2019s analysis. \nWe conclude that Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record, nor has he demonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. \n27, 2019). Among other things, we note the non-alleged conduct, which supports the Judge\u2019s \nconclusions regarding mitigation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). \nApplicant cites to Hearing Office cases in support of his argument on appeal. However, each \ncase must be decided on its own merits. Hearing Office cases are not binding on other Hearing \nOffice Judges or on the Appeal Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 at 2. \nConclusion \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On \nJanuary 31, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On January 6, 2021, after the hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a securityclearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in the findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nGuideline K Allegation \nThe Judge found against Applicant on the sole Guideline K allegation. It asserted that \nApplicant took a classified document home without authorization in 2013. In the decision, the Judge \nfound, \u201cThe security violation report indicated the document was marked \u2018Secret/NOFORN.\u2019\u201d \nDecision at 2. In his appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred in finding that the document \nwas marked \u201cSecret/NOFORN.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. We examine a challenged finding of fact to \ndetermine if it is supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same \nrecord.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018)(quoting Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1). \nThis challenge is rather narrow in its scope.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthe Guideline K allegation with an explanation. He is not now contending that he did not commit a \nsecurity violation but instead only contesting the nature of the markings on the document in question. \nApplicant\u2019s statements regarding the document\u2019s classification markings have not been \nconsistent or always clear. For example, his appeal brief states the document in question \u201cwas only \nlabeled Unclassified\u201d but later notes a portion of the document \u201cwas labeled at the bottom of the \nlandscape page as Classified.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1, emphasis in brief. In responding to interrogatories, \nApplicant acknowledged the document had classification markings by stating, \u201cYes, only Secret[.]\u201d \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2 at 4. At the hearing, a lengthy, confusing exchange occurred between \nthe Judge and Applicant regarding the document\u2019s classification markings. As best we understand \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, he was asserting the electronic version of the document consisted of a \nPowerPoint presentation with an embedded PDF file. When he printed the PowerPoint presentation, \nthe PDF file also printed. The PowerPoint pages were labeled unclassified, but the bottom of the \nPDF pages were labeled \u201cclassified,\u201d not \u201cSecret/NOFORN.\u201d Tr. at 12-15, 23-33, and 77-79. In \ndescribing Applicant\u2019s testimony, the Judge stated, \u201c[Applicant] somewhat reluctantly admitted that \nhe knew the document was classified.\u201d Decision at 2. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn a nutshell, the Judge\u2019s challenged finding is based on substantial evidence\u2014that is, the \nformer employer\u2019s security violation report, which states: \nOn 17-Sept-2013 (approximate date) [Applicant] obtained a hard copy document \nthat was labeled Secret/NOFORN at [Site A]. Subjects account of 17-Sept-2013, \n\u201cSince I had no office space at [Site A] and was still getting settled in a new office at \n[Site B] with no [Government agency] computer assigned to me yet, I took the \ndocument in my locked briefcase home overnight. I knew this was not proper \nprotocol, but I felt the risk was mitigated since it was locked in my briefcase.\u201d [GE \n3 at 1, emphasis added.] \nThe Judge\u2019s challenged finding merely reported what the security violation report states. A Joint \nPersonnelAdjudicationSystementryalso indicated the document was\u201ca hardcopySecret/NOFORN \ndocument.\u201d GE 4. Regarding this challenge, it merits noting that we have previously stated the \nfindings and conclusions in a company\u2019s security investigation should be given deference. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)(\u201c[B]ecause of the unique position of \nemployers as actual administrators of classified programs and the degree of knowledge possessed by \nthem in any particular case, their determinations and characterizations regarding security violations \nare entitled to considerable deference, and should not be discounted or contradicted without a cogent \nexplanation.\u201d). As a related matter, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion that Applicant \ncommitted a security violation. \nIn his brief, Applicant notes this security violation occurred over seven years ago and argues \nthere should be a seven-year statute of limitation for considering such misconduct. This argument \nis not persuasive.  The Board has consistently declined to establish \"bright-line\" guidance regarding \nthe concept of recency. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0018 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 11, 2000). In \ndetermining whether or not conduct of security significance is recent, a Judge must carefully consider \nthe totality of the record evidence.  In this case, the Judge conducted such an analysis. Noting first \nthat a security violation is one of the strongest possible reasons for denying or revoking security \nclearance eligibility and that an applicant has a very heavy burden to mitigate the concerns arising \nfrom a proven security violation, the Judge concluded that Applicant failed to meet that burden \nbecause of his many incidents of poor judgment (discussed below), including an incident in which his \nemployment was terminated in 2018 for violating rules by walking around a Federal building without \nan escort, and for failing to accept full responsibility for his security violation. 1 Applicant has not \nestablished the Judge erred in his analysis. \nGuideline E Allegations \n1 The Judge cited ISCR Case No. 03-26888 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2006) for the propositions that security \nviolations strike at the heart of the industrial security program, that an applicant has very heavy burden to mitigate an \nestablished security violation, and that a Judge must apply strict scrutiny to an applicant\u2019s claims of reform and \nrehabilitation in security violation cases. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder this guideline, the SOR alleged that Applicant was terminated from nine jobs between \n2004 and 2018 for various reasons, including the mishandling of classified material incident in 2013; \nthat he received a Incident Warning Letter from an employer in 2015; that he had 12 motor vehicle \nviolations in a specific county between 2006 and 2019, during which his driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for about 90 days; and that he had two speeding violations in another state in 2009. The \nJudge found against Applicant on 10 of the 12 Guideline E allegations. The two favorable findings \ninvolved alleged employment terminations. Those favorable findings were not raised as an issue on \nappeal. \nIn his brief, Applicant provides explanations for each of his employment terminations and \nargues: \nAs far as the problematic employment history is concerned, each case needs \nto be looked at independent of the other situations. There is no pattern of behavior \nper se in this area. Every termination has to be examined on a case by case basis. I \nknow how to follow directions, especially in the area of security procedures. \nRemember I have taken and passed four polygraphs . . . from 2006 to 2018. [Appeal \nBrief at 2.] \nIn essence, Applicant is advocating for a \u201cpiecemeal analysis\u201d of the evidence, which the Appeal \nBoard has long discounted as an appropriate manner in which to analyze the evidence. When \nweighing the evidence, the Judge must consider the evidence as a whole and not view it in an isolated \nand piecemeal fashion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02069 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2018). See also, \nRaffone v. Adams, 468 F. 2d 860, 866 (2nd Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a \nsignificance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation). As noted above, the Judge in \nthis case properly considered the evidence in its entirety in analyzing the security significance of \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct. \nWeighing Evidence \nApplicant contends the Judge overemphasized the negative aspects of the case and gave little \nor no mention to the positive aspects. In doing so, he emphasizes that he has passed four security-\nrelated polygraphs in his career. The ability to pass a polygraph, however, is not a determinative \nfactor in assessing an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00751 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2019). Other factors such as judgment and reliability must also be taken into \nconsiderationinassessing anindividual\u2019s securityclearance worthiness. Applicant also highlights the \nactions that he has taken to reform and rehabilitate himself and argues the security incident will never \nhappen again. Applicant\u2019s assertions are not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, \n2020). Furthermore, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to \nmake a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence \nas a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice \nversa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Mar. 31, 2020). \nNew Evidence \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains matters from outside the record, including documentation \nshowing he completed driver and security training. We cannot consider new evidence on appeal. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed anyharmfulerror. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

On \nJanuary 16, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On June 2, 2021, after considering \nthe record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. \nLokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nApplicant, who is in his fifties, works for a defense contractor. He is married, has a child, \nand holds a Ph.D. The SOR alleges that he has 11 delinquent debts totaling about $27,700. \nApplicant admitted each of these allegations. His financial problems arose because he was living \nbeyond his means. About six years ago, he also lost a job and was unable to make consistent \npayments towards the delinquent debts. He attended financial planning classes and claims he has \nchanged his spending habits and is living within his means.  He has received settlement offers for \nsome of the accounts, but each of the alleged debts remain unresolved. He has not demonstrated his \nfinancial problems are under control or unlikely to recur.  \nAbout six years ago, Applicant was terminated from a Federal Government position due to \nmisconduct. He had held that position for over 25 years. During this employment, he was charged \nwith making false statements and failure to observe written procedures. He received a notice of \nproposed removal, but it was held in abeyance when he entered into a Last Chance Agreement \n(LCA), which placed him in a two year probationary status. In signing the LCA, he admitted the \ncharges in the removal notice were true. About three or four months after signing the LCA, his \nemployer determined he violated the agreement and removed him from the position. He appealed \nthat decision to the Merit System Protection Board, but that appeal was dismissed for lack of \njurisdiction because he waived his appeal rights in the LCA. He contends his removal from the \nposition was unjust and based on his supervisor\u2019s misunderstandings and incorrect assumptions \nregarding his conduct. He has not taken responsibility for his misconduct, which raises serious \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant has presented letters of recommendation that attest to his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. He recently received his Ph.D. in Philosophy with an overall \nGPA of 3.71.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in her findings about his Ph.D. and GPA, noting he \nhas not completed his Ph.D in a different subject than the Judge noted. These errors, however, are \nharmless because they did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11\u00ad\n15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013). \nApplicant argues the Judge\u2019s decision is based on incomplete information. For example, he \npoints out that he provided the names of character references in his security clearance application \nand none of them were contacted to obtain whole-person information about him. This argument is \nnot persuasive. A Judge has no authority to interview individuals or otherwise serve as an \ninvestigator in the case, which would be inconsistent with his or her duty of impartiality. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 19-01539 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 9, 2020). Additionally, Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides \n\u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d If Applicant wanted \nthe Judge to consider specific evidence, he was responsible for presenting it to her. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record nor are they sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a \nmanner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant notes a comment at the end of his interview summary to the effect that nothing in \nApplicant\u2019s background could be used for blackmail. Even if that represents the considered opinion \nof the clearance investigator it is not binding on the DoD in its evaluation of Applicant\u2019s case. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02158 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2019). \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

On \nSeptember 27, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On November 2, 2020, after the hearing, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge\u2019s favorable findings regarding the Guideline F \nallegations were not raised as an issue on appeal. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his 20s, has worked for a defense contractor for about eight years. Over \nthe years, Applicant incurred nine delinquent debts totaling about $45,000, including a judgment for \na car loan totaling about $10,900. Applicant cosigned the car loan for his roommate who defaulted \non it, which led to the creditor obtaining a judgment against both Applicant and the roommate in July \n2018. Since August 2020, the roommate has been paying this debt through a garnishment. \nIn November 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in which he \ndid not list the judgment in response to a pertinent question. The Judge specifically found: \nApplicant contends that the omission was unintentional, as he did not know about this \njudgment until after he completed the security clearance application. (Tr. 60) \nApplicant and the primary borrower on the loan were roommates when the judgment \nwas filed. (Tr. 61) The initial [court] pleading lists both gentlemen as codefendants. \n(GE [Government Exhibit] 4) The court records indicate that the court issued two \nsummons in April 2018 and that service was executed on two individuals on June 20, \n2018 (GE 4 at 3) [Decision at 3.] \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he wasunaware that the primaryborrower wasbehind onthe debt \nor that the debt collection process legal proceedings had been initiated is not credible in light of the \ncourt records showing service of process as well as the fact that he and the primary borrower were \nroommates. Applicant\u2019s resolution of his financial problems is insufficient to outweigh that security \nconcerns generated by his failure to disclose a judgment as required on his SCA. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends the evidence presented at the hearing does not support \nthe Judge\u2019s unfavorable clearance decision. He argues that he \u201cdid not recall\u201d the judgment for the \ncar loan when he completed his SCA, that his roommate did not disclose to him information about \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthe car loan being in default, and that having a roommate is not proof that he was aware of every \ndecision the roommate made regarding the car or its loan. 1 Appeal Brief at 1. \nApplicant\u2019s brief essentially repeats claims he made below that the Judge discounted. \nApplicant\u2019s denial of prior knowledge of the judgment before completing the SCA is not conclusive \nevidence. See. e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-06926 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 25, 2003). Such prior knowledge \ncould be proven by circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. \n6, 2021). Besides not listing the judgment on his SCA, Applicant also did not disclose on that \ndocument, as required, the voluntary repossession of his car in 2017 and his other debts that were \ncharged off, placed for collection, or over 120 days delinquent within the last seven years. GE 1-3 \nand 5. Those multiple omissions undercut any argument that his failure to disclose the judgment was \nthe result of mistake, oversight, or lack of recall. A court record (GE 4 at 3) reflects that two \nsummons for the court proceeding had been served before a judgment was entered against both \nApplicant and the roommate in July 2018, which was about four months before Applicant completed \nthe SCA. Moreover, it was not unreasonable for a Judge to infer that roommates would discuss a \nlegal action being brought against both of them. Furthermore, the Directive requires us to defer to \na Judge\u2019s credibility determination. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. From our review of the record, the \nJudge\u2019s material findings and conclusions regarding the SCA falsification are based on substantial \nevidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-02225 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient \nto demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 5. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of \nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). See also Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor \nof the national security.\u201d \n1 Applicant\u2019s claim on appeal that he \u201cdid not recall\u201d the judgment prior to completing the SCA is different \nfrom his hearing testimony that, as the Judge found, he had no knowledge of the judgment prior to completing the \nSCA. Of note, an individual\u2019s claim that he or she \u201cdid not recall\u201d a matter implies that he or she may have had prior \nknowledge of that matter. At the hearing, the Judge requested Applicant submit a letter from the roommate \n\u201cexplaining the situation with the repossessed vehicle with the judgment.\u201d Tr. at 79. In a post-hearing submission, \nApplicant submitted a letter from the roommate that discusses the status of the garnishment action being taken against \nhim; however, it neither addresses nor corroborates Applicant\u2019s claims that, prior to submission of the SCA, he and \nhis roommate did not discuss the court proceeding or his roommate did not informed him of the default on the car loan. \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit I. \n3 \n\n  \n  \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe Decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

Applicant requested a hearing. On August 4, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Marc E. Curry denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding against \nApplicant on matters considered in a prior adjudication, whether the Judge erred in finding against \nApplicant on workplace issues, whether the Judge erred in finding against Applicant on the \nfalsification allegations, and whether the decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling over \n$2,000 and the IRS garnished his wages in 2018. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the \nalleged debts and against him on the garnishment. The SOR contains 21 Guideline E allegations. \nThese are summarized as follows: (1) Applicant was issued four written warnings for poor \nperformance by Company A from about 2008 to 2010 and was terminated from that employment \nfor unsatisfactory performance in about 2010, (2) he was terminated from the employment of \nCompany B for poor performance in about 2010, (3) he was issued a written warning by Company \nC for failure to protect personally identifiable information (PII) in about 2012, (4) he was \nterminated from the employment of Company D in about 2014 and a program manager indicated \nhe had poor performance issues, (5) he falsified three responses on a security clearance application \n(SCA) in 2015, (6) he failed to disclose information during interviews with DoD investigators in \n2011, 2012, and 2014, and twice in 2015, (7) he was suspended by Company C in 2015 and had \nfailed to perform certain tasks, (8) he was terminated from the employment of Company B again \nin about 2018 for failing to complete training, (9) he was issued a written warning by Company E \nfor failing to provide requested information about his tax issues in 2018 and was terminated from \nthat employment for poor performance in 2018, and (10) he knowingly failed to disclose \ninformation in responding to DOHA interrogatories in about 2020. The Judge found in favor of \nApplicant on Guideline E allegations involving the failure to disclose information during a DoD \ninterview in 2015 and the written warning and termination pertaining to Company E (Item 9 \nabove). The Judge found against Applicant on the other Guideline E allegations. The Judge\u2019s \nfavorable findings were not raised as an issue on appeal.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asks for a third extension of time for submitting the brief. \nRegarding this issue, it is important to note that an applicant is entitled to submit only one appeal \nbrief. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03393 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). Having submitted his \nbrief, his request for another extension is moot. \nApplicant\u2019s brief contains documents that are not included in the record. The Appeal Board \nis prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.

He argues that any \nconduct that was considered in the prior adjudication is outside the scope of this adjudication. In \nother words, he is contending that the Government is precluded from reconsidering conduct that \nwas examined in a prior adjudication. This contention lacks merit. The Board has previously held \nthat there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a presumption in favor of continuing or \ngranting a security clearance. The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance \nof past conduct in light of more recent conduct having a negative security significance. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 18-02586 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2019).  In this case, the Judge committed no error \nin considering Applicant\u2019s alleged conduct that occurred before his security clearance was granted. \nApplicant argues that workplace issues are not a reason for denying a security clearance.  \nThis argument is frivolous. It is irrefutable that questionable conduct in the workplace can raise \nsecurity-significant issues. \nQuestionable workplace conduct can reflect negatively on an \napplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment; can demonstrate an unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations; and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 15 (\u201cThe Concern\u201d paragraph for \nGuideline E). Of note, certain adjudicative guidelines, such as Guideline K (Handling Protected \nInformation) and Guideline M (Use of Information Technology), and certain disqualifying \nconditions, such as alcohol-related incidents at work (Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 22(b)), are \nfocused on security-significant issues arising in the workplace.   \nApplicant argues he did not disclose certain employment in responding to Section 13A of \nhis SCA because he was self-employed as a contractor. He asserts that section only requested \ninformation pertaining to IRS Form W-2 employee services and does not extend to IRS Form 1099 \ncontractor services. He refers to his omissions as a misinterpretation of Section 13A. The plain \nlanguage of Section 13A does not support Applicant\u2019s argument. Section 13A states in part, \u201cList \nall of your employment activities, including unemployment and self-employment, beginning with \nthe present and working back 10 years.\u201d Government Exhibit (GE) 1 at 10 (emphasis added). \nApplicant\u2019s argument is also undercut by him having served as a background investigator and \npersonnel security specialist for about 15 years. Having worked in the security field for so long, \nhis argument is difficult to fathom. Section 13A makes clear all employment activities must be \ndisclosed. The Judge did not err by relying on the plain language of Section 13A in analyzing \nApplicant\u2019s answers. \nIn general, Applicant contends that he did not have the intent to commit any falsifications. \nRecord evidence establishes that Applicant did not disclose required negative information (i.e., \nthat employers issued him written warnings about his performance or terminated his employment) \nin his SCA, background interviews, and DOHA interrogatories. It is well established that an \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind can be established by circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 01-20700 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02345 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2021).  \nFurthermore, the Judge concluded that Applicant lacked credibility. The Appeal Board is required \nto give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Based on our \nreview of the record, we find no reason why we should not give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility \ndetermination in this case. The Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant deliberately falsified or omitted \nrequired information during the security clearance process were reasonable inferences drawn from \nthe record evidence.  \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted that the IRS garnished his pay in 2018. The \nJudge found that he owes over $15,000 in Federal income taxes because he incorrectly filed his \ntax returns for 2011-2013 as a 1099 contractor.  The garnishment was terminated when Applicant \nreached an agreement with the IRS on a repayment plan. Since then, Applicant has been making \npayments under that plan. The current balance of this tax debt is unknown and, as of March 2021, \nhe was one month behind on his installment payments. Decision at 2-3. In his brief, Applicant \nbasically argues the garnishment was cancelled and the existence of the payment plan resolves this \nissue. We find no basis to conclude the Judge erred in finding against Applicant on this long-\noutstanding indebtedness. It is well-established that, even if an applicant has paid a debt or is \nmaking payments on a debt, a Judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debt as \nwell as any previous actions or lapses to resolve the debt for what they reveal about the applicant\u2019s \nworthiness for a clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he was fired from Company C for falsely \nreporting he contacted a subject of an investigation when he did not do so. This assertion of error \nhas some merit. The Judge correctly found that Company C suspended Applicant in 2015 and was \nmoving to terminate him for various work performance issues. These issues also caused the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management to conduct an audit of this work. In his analysis, the Judge \nindicated that Applicant was fired from this job. In his appeal brief, Applicant correctly contends \nthere is no evidence to support that he was fired from that job and asserts he resigned from it. At \nthe hearing, he testified that he thought he resigned from Company C.  Tr. at 38-39.  Even though \nthe Judge erred in this conclusion, it was harmless because Company C was moving to terminate \nhim. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020) (an error is harmless if it did \nnot likely affect the outcome of the case).  \nApplicant argues the Judge did not consider evidence presented at the hearing. However, \nnone of his arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd.

On \nDecember 16, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn July 2, 2020, the SOR was amended to include additional Guideline F allegations. On April 16, \n2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues in the appeal: whether DOHA has jurisdiction in this \ncase and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his 60s, is married. One of his children has passed away in 2008, three \nothers survive.  He has a master\u2019s degree and has taken courses for a doctorate degree.  This is his \nfirst application for a security clearance. \nAs amended, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax \nreturns in a timely manner for 2010-2011 and 2013-2017, that he owed delinquent Federal and state \ntaxes totaling about $114,000, and that he had six other delinquent debts totaling about $18,000. In \nhis SOR responses, he admitted each allegation with the exception of those pertaining to his state \ntax filings and debts for 2013-2017 and an educational loan for about $2,740. The Judge found in \nfavor of Applicant on the alleged state tax filings and debts that he denied and on two of the other \nalleged debts (one for $669 and the other for $6,470). The Judge found against him on the remaining \nallegations.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife supervises the household finances. In 2018, an accountant and IRS \nrepresentative advised Applicant and his wife not to file their Federal income tax returns for 2010 \nand 2011 because of the passage of the statute of limitations. They received the same advice \nregarding their state income tax returns for those years. In 2019, Applicant and his wife filed their \nFederal income tax returns for 2013-2017. They owed taxes for each of those years and have not \nmade any payments towards those taxes. As of 2019, they owed the IRS about $119,000 and are \nworking on an offer in compromise.  No evidence was presented to show the IRS has received an \noffer in compromise from them. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that part of the reason she procrastinated \non filing the tax returns was because of the sudden death of their child in 2008.   \nThe alleged debts are confirmed in credit reports. Applicant and his wife attribute those \ndebts to him being laid off from a former job. He has made payments towards each of the debts and \nhas made payment arrangements for five of the six debts.  \nAlthough Applicant has filed all of the alleged tax returns, he \u201cwas extremely dilatory\u201d in \ndoing so. Decision at 8. He has just begun to resolve his delinquent consumer debt. \u201cI have \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \nDiscussion  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsidered the facts of his work issues, his [child\u2019s] tragic death, and the dilatoryconduct of his wife, \nwho was managing the family finances. All that considered, there remains the fact that there is little \ntrack record of Applicant resolving his debts, with limited exceptions.\u201d Id. He has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his tax filings and consumer debt delinquencies.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant states that, when he \u201cwas told to be at the hearing[,]\u201d his \nemployer terminated his employment and stated he must maintain a security clearance. Appeal Brief \nat 1.  This contention raises the issue whether DOHA had jurisdiction to hold a security clearance \nhearing. See Directive \u00b6 4.4, stating that, subject to certain exceptions, actions under the Directive \nshall cease upon termination of an applicant\u2019s need for access to classified information. As \nDepartment Counsel notes in his reply brief, the Judge addressed this issue at the hearing by asking \nwhether Applicant was sponsored for a security clearance. In response to that question, Department \nCounsel stated that he checked the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) the previous \nevening and, even though Applicant was no longer employed, his former employer was still \nsponsoring him for a security clearance and he could be rehired.  Based on that representation, the \nJudge concluded that DOHA still retained jurisdiction in this case. Tr. 6-9. We find no error in that \nconclusion.  Additionally, to the extent that Applicant may be claiming his former employer erred \nin terminating his employment or in the processing of his security clearance, the Appeal Board has \nno authority over actions taken by an employer.     \nApplicant also notes that DoD granted him a security clearance and later stated it was granted \nin error. In this regard, it merits noting that there is no right to a security clearance. Department of \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Nor does a prior favorable security clearance decision give \nrise to a vested right or interest in continued retention of a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-19823 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 3, 2003). To the extent that Applicant may be claiming his \nsecurity clearance could not be denied or revoked, such an argument is unpersuasive because the \nFederal Government can not be equitably estopped from denying or revoking access to classified \ninformation.  Id.    \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, his \nremaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. He \npoints out, for example, that his world stopped when his child passed away, highlights his efforts to \nresolve his financial problems, and asserts those problems did not affect his work in any manner. \nThese arguments are not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. \n22, 2017). He also notes that ineligibility for a security clearance limits his job opportunities. The \nimpact of an adverse decision on an applicant, however, is not a relevant consideration in \ndetermining his or her national security eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01759 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 8, 2020). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn May 10, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in the findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his 50s, served honorably in the military for 20 years, retiring about 12 \nyears ago. He has earned an associate\u2019s degree. Married for over 30 years, he has two adult \nchildren.  He has been working at his current job since late 2015.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his Federal income tax returns for \n2014-2016 and his state income tax returns for 2014-2015, that he owed past-due Federal taxes of \nabout $1,900 for 2017, and that he owed past-due state taxes of about $2,300 for 2012, 2016, and \n2017. In responding to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. He experienced periods of \nunemployment in 2009-2010 and 2015. In addition to his periods of unemployment, he attributed \nhis financial problems to other reasons; such as, being the sole source of income for his family due \nto his wife\u2019s medical issues, stress and financial strain from becoming the conservator for his \ngrandfather, and a motorcycle accident that required to go on short-term disability.  \nIn responding to interrogatories, Applicant provided documentation showing the IRS filed \nfor him a substitute 2014 Federal tax return, his 2015 Federal tax return had not been filed as of \nFebruary 2019, his 2016 Federal income tax return was filed in October 2017 for which he was \nassessed a penalty, his 2015 state income tax return had not been filed, and he owed the state about \n$2,300 in delinquent taxes. In early 2020, Applicant hired a tax preparation service to assist him in \nfiling his late and delinquent Federal income tax returns, which also included those for 2012-2013 \nand 2018.  He did not provide documentation showing he filed his 2014 and 2015 Federal income \ntax returns. His 2019 Federal tax refund of about $1,280 was applied to his 2017 delinquent taxes. \nNo further evidence of payments toward that tax delinquency was provided. Applicant is waiting \nfor his Federal income tax returns to be processed before filing his missing state tax returns for 2014 \nand 2015.  He does not know how much he owes in delinquent state taxes.  \nCoworkers, colleagues, and a former supervisor describe him as loyal, dedicated, and worthy \nof a security clearance.  Several wrote about the difficulties he has encountered.  His performance \nappraisals for 2016-2020 rate him as outstanding or superior.  \nApplicant failed to produce sufficient evidence showing that recurrence of tax problems is \nunlikely. Even after seeking professional assistance, the record is unclear as the whether his 2014 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand 2015 Federal income tax returns have been filed. He has not yet addressed his state tax returns \nand debt.  He has failed to put forth a good-faith effort to address his tax problems. \nDiscussion \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains documents and assertions that are not included in the \nrecord. This includes two documents that post-date the Judge\u2019s decision. The Appeal Board is \nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant raises four objections to the Judge\u2019s decision. First, he notes \nthe Judge misspelled his first name.  This was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the \noutcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013). Second, he \nargues that he provided, as he said he would during the hearing, what information he was able to \nobtain from the tax preparation service regarding the delinquent returns.  This assertion, however, \ndoes not match his testimony. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he thought the tax preparation \nservice had filed all of his delinquent Federal tax returns, and he would provide documents showing \nthose delinquent tax returns had been filed. Tr. at 20, 24-25, and 40-45. To the extent he is now \ncontending that he met his burden of production by providing what was available to him, that \nassertion is not persuasive. The burden was on Applicant to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his tax filing delinquencies. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The Judge committed no error in considering \nthat Applicant failed to prove he filed some of the alleged delinquent tax returns. Third, he cites to \nan IRS website showing it will only accept \u201camended tax returns\u201d for the past three years and argues \nthat he cannot file amended tax returns for 2012 and 2014-2016. This contention lacks merit. The \nSOR did not allege that he failed to file \u201camended tax returns.\u201d Rather, it essentially asserts he failed \nto file annual income tax returns for certain years as required by law. It is fair to say that from the \nIRS\u2019s perspective a tax return cannot be amended unless it has first been filed. His citation to the \nIRS website dealing with \u201camended tax returns\u201d is not relevant in this proceeding. Fourth, Applicant \nstates the tax preparation service told him not to pay any delinquent taxes to the IRS while they were \nnegotiating a settlement.  Such advice, however, neither serves as a defense, compels the Judge to \nrender a favorable security clearance decision, nor precludes the Judge from considering that the \ndelinquent tax debt remains unresolved. As the trier of fact, the Judge was responsible for weighing \nthe evidence as a whole and deciding whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable \nevidence, or vice versa. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to show that the Judge \nweighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. In short, Applicant\u2019s objections fail to establish that the Judge \ncommitted any harmful error.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department \nof the Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is in his mid-50s. He has been employed by a Defense contractor since late 2017. This is his first application for a security clearance. He holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. Married, he has two adult children. Applicant began using marijuana in 1980. He used marijuana about two or three times a week for about 40 years, in order to address anxiety disorder. He sought professional help regarding anxiety in the mid-1990s, his provider prescribing a legal drug that had possible long-term side effects. He reduced his ingestion of the prescription drug and continued using marijuana. In 2011, he obtained a prescription for medical marijuana at a state-sanctioned dispensary. Prior to that, he obtained marijuana from persons with similar needs. Over time, Applicant shifted away from the use of drugs, legal or otherwise, due to the influence of his religious beliefs. In April 2019, on Easter Sunday, he made a commitment to develop strategies for controlling his anxiety without the use of drugs. He now pursues a regimen of exercise and good diet and has been meeting with a psychologist.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nAubrey DeAngelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nSean M. Bigley, Esq. \nJeffrey D. Billett, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \n\nNovember 15, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing.  On March 29, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Tuider granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is \nunsupported by the greater weight of the record evidence and, therefore, is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his mid-50s. He has been employed by a Defense contractor since late 2017. \nThis is his first application for a security clearance. He holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. \nMarried, he has two adult children. \nApplicant began using marijuana in 1980. He used marijuana about two or three times a \nweek for about 40 years, in order to address anxiety disorder. He sought professional help regarding \nanxiety in the mid-1990s, his provider prescribing a legal drug that had possible long-term side \neffects. He reduced his ingestion of the prescription drug and continued using marijuana. In 2011, \nhe obtained a prescription for medical marijuana at a state-sanctioned dispensary. Prior to that, he \nobtained marijuana from persons with similar needs. \nOver time, Applicant shifted away from the use of drugs, legal or otherwise, due to the \ninfluence of his religious beliefs. In April 2019, on Easter Sunday, he made a commitment to \ndevelop strategies for controlling his anxiety without the use of drugs. He now pursues a regimen \nof exercise and good diet and has been meeting with a psychologist. He also attended Narcotics \nAnonymous (NA) in mid-to-late 2020, and it has been two years since he has used marijuana.  \nApplicant completed his security clearance application (SCA) in October 2017, disclosing \nhis past marijuana use. He had no prior experience with the security clearance process. In \nNovember 2018 Applicant underwent a clearance interview, admitting his marijuana use up until that \ndate.  His use of marijuana continued for about six months thereafter.  He does not associate with \npersons who use marijuana, and he understands that the use of illegal drugs is not tolerated at his \nplace of employment and/or while he holds a clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist has extensive experience in evaluating securityclearance applicants. \nThis provider did not diagnosis Applicant with a drug use disorder but, rather, with Social Anxiety \nDisorder. He concluded that Applicant does not meet any of the criteria for substance use disorder \nand that Applicant \u201c\u2018is free from any problems of drug or alcohol use and pose[s] no risk to the \nnational security as a result of his prior usage.\u2019\u201d Decision at 4. \nApplicant is considered to be diligent and a person of integrity. His most recent work \n2 \n\nperformance review rated him as exceeding expectations. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s last instance of marijuana use, which took place twenty \nmonths before the hearing, was not recent within the meaning of the Directive. Moreover, he \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s record was \u201creplete with compelling evidence that Applicant has turned \nthe corner on achieving marijuana abstinence.\u201d  Decision at 8.  He cited to Applicant\u2019s dedication \nto being a good husband and father and to Applicant\u2019s recognition that drug use is not compatible \nwith the standards expected of him by his employer. \nThe Judge stated that Applicant no longer associates with persons who use marijuana and has \nabstained since April 2019, as noted above. The Judge also cited to the opinions expressed by \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist and his character reference, as well as to evidence of Applicant\u2019s excellent \nwork performance. The Judge stated that he evaluated Applicant\u2019s demeanor, candor, and \nreputation, concluding that Applicant\u2019s assertion that he will no longer use illegal drugs is credible. \nDiscussion \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). The Appeal Board may reverse the \nJudge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to \nrebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cThe application of disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more \nof them apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of \nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at \n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactoryexplanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails \nto consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary \n3 \n\nto the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of \nopinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision does not reflect a reasonable \ninterpretation of the record viewed as a whole, citing to testimony and to various pieces of evidence \nthat he contends undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. We find Department Counsel\u2019s arguments to be \npersuasive. Drug abuse \u201ccan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 24. We note the following, drawn from the Judge\u2019s findings as well as \nthe record evidence.  \nApplicant began using marijuana in about 1980. Although he did so initially due to \npeer pressure, he found that it was helpful in relieving anxiety.  He used marijuana \ntwo or three times a week. Decision at 2; Government Exhibit (GE) 1, 2017 SCA, \nat 36-37; Tr. at 19-23. \nWhen he entered his 30s, Applicant sought professional care in addressing his \nproblems with anxiety. The doctor prescribed an anxiety medication for Applicant. \nHowever, he continued using marijuana after he began taking the prescribed drug. \nTr. at 24-25. \nIn September 2017, a prospective employer rescinded a job offer to Applicant due to \nApplicant having failed a drug test. GE 2, Interrogatories, at 5; Clearance Interview, \nincluded in GE 2, at 14. \nIn October 2017 Applicant completed his SCA. Applicant stated in his SCA that he \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future.  Decision at 4; GE 1 at 37. \nIn November 2018, Applicant underwent a clearance interview, which \u201chad an \nimpact on him.\u201d During this interview, he acknowledged his continued use of \nmarijuana after completion of his SCA. He told the investigator that he did not \nintend to be involved with marijuana again. Decision at 4; Clearance Interview at 13. \nApplicant continued using marijuana after his clearance interview. He stopped using \nmarijuana in April 2019.  Decision at 3-4; Tr. at 45. \nApplicant testified that his use of marijuana was \u201ccalculated, strategic.\u201d Tr. at 51. \nHe admitted that when he completed his SCA he understood that state law did not \naffect Federal drug laws to the contrary. Tr. at 55. \nWe have considered Judge\u2019s decision and the entirety of the record evidence, noting in \nparticular Applicant\u2019s anxiety disorder, the favorable opinion of his psychologist, his character \nreference, and his testimony about his life-style changes and his religious convictions. However, \n4 \n\nevidence cited above shows that Applicant continued using an illegal substance after having been \nplaced on notice of the significance of such conduct. This raises serious questions about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. Applicant\u2019s misconduct persisted even after he had been \ndenied employment due to a failed drug test; after his completion of his SCA which, he testified, \nmade him aware that marijuana use is a violation of Federal law (Tr.at 55); and after discussion of \nhis marijuana use during his clearance interview. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJan. 15, 2019)(An applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs after having completed an SCA or after otherwise \nhaving been placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug abuse and clearance eligibility raises \nquestions about his or her judgment, reliability, and willingness to complywith rules and regulations). \nIndeed, Applicant described his security-significant conduct as calculated and strategic, foreclosing \nreliance upon mistake of fact or law and underscoring the knowing and willful quality of his behavior. \nMoreover, there is substantial evidence that Applicant made two promises nearly a year apart \nto the DoD that he would refrain from illegal drug use in the future, promises which he failed to keep. \nThis is of particular significance, given that Applicant\u2019s presentation at the hearing consisted in large \nmeasure upon a similar promise, one that the Judge found credible. As noted above, in a DOHA \nproceeding the applicant bears the burden of persuasion that he or she should have access to classified \ninformation, viewed in the context of the standard set forth in Egan, supra. The Directive places \nupon an applicant the responsibility to present evidence of rehabilitation and mitigation, and we give \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination. That deference, however, is not without limits. \nWhen the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility, the Judge should address that \naspect of the record explicitly, explaining why he or she finds applicant\u2019s version of events to be \nworthy of belief. Failure to do so suggests that the Judge has merely substituted a favorable \nimpression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at \n4 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019).  \nThe Decision fails adequately to explain why Applicant\u2019s evidence that he will remain drug \nfree is of sufficient credibility as to meet that burden. In the Analysis portion of the Decision, the \nJudge cited to Applicant\u2019s drug counseling, religious involvement, current sobriety, and his promise \nto refrain from drug use in the future. He did not provide a meaningful analysis of these matters in \nlight of the countervailing evidence listed above, particularly Applicant\u2019s failed prior promises to \nabstain. We conclude that Applicant\u2019s security significant conduct\u2014viewed cumulatively\u2014is \ninconsistent with the Judge\u2019s credibility determination and weighs heavily against Applicant\u2019s effort \nto demonstrate rehabilitation. Even if Applicant has, indeed, remained drug free for twenty months, \nthe predictive power of such a circumstance must be evaluated in light of Applicant\u2019s forty years of \nmarijuana use, which persisted during the pendency of his clearance investigation. Such conduct is \nat substantial variance with the requirement that holding a security clearance must be \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the interests of the national security.\u201d See Egan, supra. We conclude that the record \nas a whole supports Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge appears to have substituted a \nfavorable impression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor for record evidence.  \nGiven the record before us, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision does not \nmeaningfully address all relevant factors and runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. The \nrecord as a whole does not support the Judge\u2019s favorable decision. \n5 \n\nOrder \nThe Decision is REVERSED.     \nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan        \nMichael Y.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nDan Meyer, Esq. \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 18, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On July 16, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Government met its burden \nof proof, whether the Judge erred in the findings of fact, whether the Judge erred in a credibility \ndetermination, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his late thirties, has been working for a defense contractor since late \n2020, earning about $98,000 annually. While working previously for another defense contractor, \nhe earned about half that amount.  Never married, he has a child.  He has attended college classes \nbut has not earned a degree. He was granted a security clearance previously. Friends and former \ncolleagues attest to his diligence, trustworthiness, reliability, and honesty. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his Federal and state income tax returns \nfor 2012-2015; that he owed nearly $2,300 in Federal income taxes for 2016 that remained unpaid; \nand that he had three other delinquent debts totaling over $300.  He admitted the SOR allegations \nwith explanations. He sought the assistance of tax firms to help him resolve his tax problems. He \ndocumented that he signed his Federal income tax returns for 2013-2015 in October 2019. He was \nprovided the opportunity to present Federal and state tax transcripts showing he filed the tax returns \nat issue, but he failed to do so.   \nApplicant owes the IRS about $19,300 for tax years 2014-2017 and 2019. In January 2021, \nhe entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in which he is to pay $100 per month during \n2021 and $200 per month starting in 2022. To date, he has made the scheduled payments. Any \nFederal tax liability he may have for 2012 and 2013 remains uncertain. He also entered into an \ninstallment agreement to pay a state tax liability of about $20,300 and is making the required \nbiweekly payments of $300. \nApplicant claimed he satisfied a judgment against him for $170 in 2017, but failed to \nprovide any documentation of its satisfaction. He provided documentation that he resolved one of \nthe two delinquent utility debts alleged in the SOR, but presented no documentation regarding the \nresolution of the other.  \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties associated with his multiple failures over a \nnumber of years to file his federal and state income tax returns as required by law, combined with \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nhis accumulated delinquent federal and state tax and other debt delinquencies that have only been \nrecently addressed, preclude his taking advantage of any of the potentially available extenuating \nor mitigating benefits covered by the financial considerations guideline.\u201d Decision at 8. \nDiscussion \nBurden of Proof \nApplicant contends that the Judge \u201cfailed to rule correctly on the Government\u2019s meeting \nof the burden of proof.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. The Government is required to produce evidence only \nregarding allegations that have been controverted. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. See also ISCR Case No. \n13-01281 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014). In this case, the Government had no burden to produce \nevidence to prove the SOR allegations because Applicant admitted each of them. On the other \nhand, Applicant was responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns arising from the admitted SOR allegations and he had \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable clearance decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \nThis assignment of error lacks merit. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in the findings of fact, but he does not identify any \nspecific finding that is unsupported by record evidence or otherwise flawed. This generalized \nassignment of error fails for a lack of specificity. The Appeal Board does not review cases de \nnovo, but rather is tasked with addressing \u201cthe material issues raised by the parties to determine \nwhether harmful error occurred.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32, emphasis added in quote. See also ISCR \nCase No. 17-03372 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018) (discussing the reasons why assignments of \nerror must be set forth with specificity).  \nHearing-Level Decisions \nApplicant\u2019s brief relies extensively on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F \ncases to argue the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. His reliance on those hearing-level \ndecisions is misplaced. Hearing-level decisions are not legally binding precedent on the Appeal \nBoard. The Board is neither required to justify why it chooses not to follow hearing-level decisions \nnor required to reconcile its decisions with such lower decisions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-\n00327 at 2 (App. Bd. May 20, 2020). Nor are Judges at the hearing level required to follow\u2014or \notherwise justify or reconcile their decisions with\u2014other hearing-level decisions. Id.  \u201cEach case \nmust be judged on its own merits[.]\u201d  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s scope of review is narrow. We examine a Judge\u2019s challenged \nconclusions to determine whether they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.3. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-07766 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) for the proposition \nthat the Appeal Board may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge, which is what \nApplicant, in effect, is advocating by citing other hearing-level decisions. See also, ISCR Case \nNo. 11-13965 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2013) (\u201cWe do not have to agree with a Judge\u2019s decision to \nfind it sustainable.\u201d). It is also fair to state that other hearing-level decisions involving arguably \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nsimilar Guideline F fact scenarios to the one in this case could be identified in which Judges \nreached unfavorable security clearance decisions. To highlight this latter point, we note the Judge \ndiscussed in his decision an Appeal Board decision (ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 2-5 (App. Bd. \nAug. 3, 2018)) that he indicated had \u201ca fact pattern similar to the one detailed in Applicant\u2019s case.\u201d \nDecision at 8. In that case, the Appeal Board reversed a Judge\u2019s favorable clearance decision. \nApplicant does not address that prior Appeal Board decision in his appeal brief. As the Board has \npreviously stated, how particular fact scenarios in other cases were decided at the hearing level are \ngenerally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). In short, Applicant\u2019s arguments based on favorable hearing-level \ndecisions in cases involving different applicants and different facts do not establish that the Judge\u2019s \nconclusions and analysis in this case are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nCredibility Determination \nApplicant asserts \u201c[b]y not properly assessing the credibility and weight of such evidence, \nthe lower tribunal has made his negative assessment of applicant\u2019s credibility a substitute for \nrecord evidence.\u201d Appeal Brief at 15. We do not find this assignment of error persuasive. First, \nwe note the Judge did not make a specific credibility determination. We do not agree with \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that his disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the unidentified \u201csuch \nevidence\u201d establishes the Judge made a negative credibility determination. In this regard, a Judge\u2019s \ndecision to not accept an applicant\u2019s claim of having resolved a financial allegation does not equate \nto a negative credibility determination. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, it is reasonable \nto expect applicants to present documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial \nproblems. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). A Judge\u2019s adverse \nconclusion regarding an SOR allegation in the face of an applicant\u2019s uncorroborated claim of \nhaving resolved that allegation may simply amount to a determination that the applicant did not \nmeet his or her burden of persuasion. Second, Applicant does not explain how the Judge\u2019s \npurported negative credibility determination constitutes a substitute for record evidence. We are \nunable to discern what evidence was substituted by that purported credibility determination and \nnote, as discussed above, the Government had no burden of producing evidence in this case. \nFinally, we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1. If the Judge made a negative credibility determination in this case, Applicant\u2019s bare \nassertion of error without explaining the reasoning behind it or citing supporting evidence fails to \nestablish why we should not give that credibility determination deference. \nWeighing of the Evidence \nAs noted above, Applicant contends the Judge improperly assessed and weighed the \nevidence. He argues, for example, that his past-due taxes originated during a period of low income \nwhen he was living paycheck-to-paycheck, that he is now getting professional assistance, and that \nhe has created a track record of paying his debts. He also asserts the Judge failed to consider \nsignificant evidence but does not identify that evidence. His arguments are neither sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.

On \nNovember 25, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On August 4, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline B allegations. Those favorable \nfindings have not been raised as an issue on appeal. Applicant raised the following issues on \nappeal: whether the Judge erred in applying the Guideline F disqualifying conditions, whether the \nJudge erred in her findings of fact and conclusions, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s \ndecision.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his forties, is married with children, and has earned an associate\u2019s and \nbachelor\u2019s degree. His employment with a defense contractor is contingent on him obtaining a \nsecurity clearance. Character reference letters describe him as dependable and indicate he would \nbe a great asset to any organization. He and his wife earned over $150,000 in 2019 and about \n$117,000 in 2020. \nApplicant has about $44,000 in student loans that were referred for collection. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted this sole Guideline F allegation. After obtaining his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2004, he began repaying the student loans. In 2007, he stopped making \npayments after losing his job and the loans were placed in forbearance. Upon obtaining another \njob, he asked the creditor to reduce the amount of the loan payments due to limited income. This \nrequest was denied. The loans were eventually referred for collection.  \nIn about 2010, the creditor told Applicant that he needed to rehabilitate the student loans \nby paying about $470 per month for six months and then the amount of the payments would be \nreduced. After making about three payments, he was informed the amount of the monthly payment \nneeded to be increased because another loan was added to the rehabilitation plan. He stopped \nmaking payments on the student loans and has not made any payments in the past decade. Since \ndefaulting on the loans, he has invested about $3,500 in a failed business venture and traveled \nextensively overseas. \n\u201cApplicant admitted that he has been contacted several times by different collection \ncompanies requesting payments over the years\u201d (Decision at 6) but denied any recent contacts.   \nHis recent attempts to reestablish contact with the creditor were unsuccessful, and he has been \nunable to determine who holds the loans. He did not provide any documentation corroborating \nthose attempts.  His 2010 Federal tax refund was withheld but he has received refunds since then. \nHe intends to repay the student loan account but did not provide details of his plan. He does not \nhave any other delinquent debts.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nDisqualifying Conditions 19(b), unwillingness to satisfy debts, regardless of the ability to \ndo so, and 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations, apply in this case. Applicant\u2019s \nrepayment of the student loans was not a priority given his travel, business investment, and \nongoing financial support to family members. His six-figure income in the last two years \nhighlights his unwillingness to satisfy his debts. He has failed to demonstrate that he acted \nresponsibly or in good-faith in his efforts to repay the student loans. He has failed to establish that \nthe student loans are being resolved or addressed. His promises to pay the student loans in the \nfuture falls short of mitigating the alleged security concerns. \nDiscussion \nDisqualifying Conditions \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in concluding his \u201csingle debt establishes an \nunwillingness to satisfy debts and a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n7. He argues Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) and 19(c) must involve a pattern of behavior and \nmultiple debts. This argument is not persuasive. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, a \nsingle debt can be sufficient to raise Guideline F security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n05366 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2016).  Additionally, a single debt that remains unpaid over a period \nof years can properly be characterized as a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Applicant had more than one student loan that was \ndelinquent. In disclosing the alleged student loan account in his security clearance application, \nApplicant stated, \u201cI tried to consolidate in order to get lower payment plan, but i (sic) was told that \ni (sic) have to get all the loans out of default status then they may work with me.\u201d Government \nExhibit (GE) 1 at 83. \nIt is also worth noting that Applicant admitted the SOR allegation in question. His \nadmission proved that allegation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14 and ISCR Case No. 02-21087 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2005). The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between \nproven circumstances under any of its guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. See. e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is \nnot required. Id. Applicant has failed to establish the Judge erred in concluding that Disqualifying \nConditions 19(b) and 19(c) applied in this case and his delinquent student loan account raises \nsecurity concerns. Having admitted the delinquent account, Applicant was then responsible for \nmitigating the security concerns arising from it and has the ultimate burden of persuasion in \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \nFindings of Fact \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claims the Judge erred in making a finding of fact. We examine a challenged \nfinding to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence \nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018) \n(quoting from Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \nApplicant argues the Judge erred in finding \u201cApplicant admitted that he had been contacted \nseveral times by different collection companies requesting payment over the years.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 7, quoting from Decision at 6. This assignment of error has merit. Applicant testified that his \nstudent loan account was placed for collections in about 2008. Tr. at 70-71. In his background \ninterview, he stated the student loan company called him to increase the amount of the payments \nwhile he was participating in a rehabilitation program.  He stopped making the payments because \nhe could not afford the increase. GE 3 at 9. He also testified that he called about six different \ncollection agencies to track down the student loans but was repeatedly informed the account was \nsold to another company. Tr. at 48. Additionally, he indicated that he has not made any payments \non student loans for more than ten years and no one has contacted him about the loans. Tr. at 72. \nWhile the evidence does not support a finding that collection companies contacted him \u201cseveral \ntimes\u201d requesting payments, this was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome \nof the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02239 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2020). In this regard, the \nJudge\u2019s overall conclusion that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from the \nalleged debt is sustainable. For example, Applicant failed to establish when he called the collection \ncompanies to identify the one handling his student loan account. More specifically, we are unable \nto determine whether those attempts were spread out over the past decade or only occurred recently \nafter his eligibility to obtain a security clearance was placed in jeopardy. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017)(the timing of the resolution of financial problems is an \nimportant factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation). The lack of such evidence is a \nfactor that could be considered in evaluating whether Applicant established he acted responsibly \nin attempting to resolve this debt.    \nJudge\u2019s Conclusions \nApplicant disagrees with two of the Judge\u2019s conclusions, claiming they were not supported \nby record evidence. These conclusions are: (1) \u201cApplicant stated that he does not have enough \nincome to repay his student loans.\u201d and (2) \u201cThere was a \u2018long period of inaction\u2019 in which \n[Applicant] failed to attempt to resolve his student loan debt.\u201d Appeal Brief at 7, quoting from \nDecision at 11 and 12. We examine challenged conclusions to determine whether they are \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \nThese challenges are not meritorious. Regarding the first challenge, Applicant argues that \nthe conclusion about his lack of income is incorrect as of \u201cJune 30, 2021.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12. \nThe conclusion in question, however, must be read in context. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02181 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2019)(a Judge\u2019s individual words or sentences are not reviewed in isolation \nbut instead in light of the entire decision). From our review, this challenged conclusion was not \nreferring to Applicant\u2019s income on the date of the hearing, but instead was generally addressing \nhis financial status during the entire period of this indebtedness. \nThe evidence shows that \nApplicant defaulted on the student loan account when he lost his job in about 2007 (Tr. at 47-48 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand 70-71), he was unable to make increased payments under a rehabilitation program in about \n2009 (Tr. at 48 and 71-72), he has made no payments on the student loan account in the past decade \n(Tr. at 72), and, as discussed earlier, he failed to establish when he made the attempts to track \ndown the collection company handling that account. Both of the Judge\u2019s challenged conclusions \nwere reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. In short, Applicant failed to show those \nconclusions were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nMitigating Conditions \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to apply properly the mitigating conditions. He \nasserts, for example, that the debt at issue was incurred a long time ago and is infrequent, he made \nresponsible and good-faith efforts to resolve it, and he is able and willing to pay it. He also argues \nthe Judge failed to consider that he contacted multiple debt collectors to determine who held his \nstudent loan account, even though the Judge made findings about those efforts. Applicant\u2019s \narguments are neither enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence \nin the record nor sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020).  \nConclusion \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted \nonly when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant works for a Defense contractor. Previous to that, he served on active duty with \nthe U.S. military. He holds degrees from a military academy and a military post graduate school. \nHe holds a security clearance, which, for reasons set forth below, was suspended from 2006 until \n2009.  Married, he has three children. \nIn 2006, Applicant, who was on active duty at the time, was arrested at a U.S. airport for \nhaving surreptitiously videoed women at a baggage carrousel by means of a camcorder placed \nbeneath their dresses, a practice known as \u201cupskirting.\u201d Applicant initially denied the misconduct, \nalthough police noticed a videotape fall from Applicant\u2019s pocket as he moved from his seat. After \nthis discovery, Applicant confessed and admitted the misconduct as well to a previous incident from \nanother airport. The evidence seized from Applicant showed the filming of five women. It also \nshowed that his \u201cupskirting\u201d activityoccurred at a shopping mall and possiblya militarydepartment \nstore in addition to airports. Found guilty at trial, Applicant was sentenced to confinement for two \nyears, suspended, with the charges dismissed after successful completion of probation. \nApplicant denied that his misconduct was as extensive as the evidence appeared to show. \nThe Judge noted that he had struggled to keep his wife from discovering his activities. In 2006, \nauthorities suspended his security clearance, and the next year he was brought before a Board of \nInquiry (BOI) to determine if he should be separated from the military. The BOI resulted in a \nfavorable determination, retaining Applicant in the service. A staff psychiatrist at a military \nbehavioral health clinic concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct was situational, a result of multiple \nstressors he had been experiencing at the time. She made no diagnosis. Applicant\u2019s clearance was \nrestored in 2009, though with a caution \u201cthat receipt of any derogatory information in the future, \nespecially of a similar nature, will be cause for reconsideration of [Applicant\u2019s] eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance and/or special access.\u201d  Decision at 3.  \nIn 2017, after his retirement from the military and while working for a Defense contractor, \nApplicant attended a sports tournament in which his daughter was playing.

Store police personally observed the man place \na basket under women, at one point actually attempting to pull a woman\u2019s skirt open to enhance the \nview. The store security camera recorded this activity, and police placed a close-up photo of the man \non an online network seeking identification. \u201cThe photo shows a man that clearly resembles \nApplicant, wearing a shirt bearing the name of a small college located in another state . . . which \nApplicant\u2019s son attended.\u201d Decision at 4-5. As a result of the online request for information, at least \n100 friends, associates, and coworkers contacted Applicant and his spouse and identified him as the \nman in the picture. During subsequent investigation, coworkers clearly identified Applicant as the \nsuspect. However, criminal charges were dismissed as nolle prosequi, and Applicant is applying for \nexpungement of the record.1 \nApplicant denied committing the 2017 offense, insisting that his resemblance to the offender \nwas coincidental. He made inconsistent statements about the extent of his counseling following the \nfirst incident, and he presented no counseling records into evidence at the hearing. Applicant sought \ntreatment after the later incident, and his counselor testified that Applicant is a truthful person with \nno need for continued therapy. However, he did not disclose the details of any admissions Applicant \nmay have made during his sessions. Applicant testified that his wife believes that he is the man in \nthe store security photograph. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s contention that he did not commit the 2017 offense. The \nJudge stated that Applicant has shown a practice of denying his offenses, both in 2006 and in the \nmore recent one. He characterized Applicant\u2019s behavior as \u201creprehensible,\u201d and described \nApplicant\u2019s claims of innocence as \u201cabsurd.\u201d Decision at 9. He noted that Applicant had resumed \nhis criminal activity despite having undergone counseling. He stated that Applicant\u2019s having \ndeclined to authorize his counselor to disclose the contents of his counseling sessions precluded the \nJudge from drawing reasonable conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s success in treatment. The Judge \nstated that Applicant had not demonstrated that he followed a legitimate treatment plan and that his \nbehavior is under control.

He argues that he was truthful in responding to questions \nabout his past behavior.  \nApplicant\u2019s claims of truthfulness during a proceeding in which he denied having committed \nthe 2017 offense could impliedly constitute an assertion that the Judge\u2019s findings on this matter were \nin error. We have examined the record evidence as a whole, including GE 10, the police report that \ndescribes the offense and its subsequent investigation, and GE 11, the photo of the offender posted \nonline and that the Judge found clearly resembled Applicant. We have also considered Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony that nearly 100 persons noticed that resemblance and that his wife believed that he was, \nin fact, the person represented in GE 11. Tr. at 87. We conclude that the Judge\u2019s material findings \nare supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support \na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nMoreover, to the extent that Applicant is challenging the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions about \nhis credibility, we note that we are required to give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. The record supports the Judge\u2019s findings about inconsistent statements by \nApplicant, which in and of themselves can undermine the credibility of his testimony. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2017). The totality of the Judge\u2019s findings, and the \nrecord evidence upon which they are based\u2013including the Judge\u2019s finding about Applicant\u2019s \nresemblance to the security photo of the suspect\u2013support his adverse credibility determination. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis. He cites to record evidence, including \nhis educational attainments, his military career, and his excellent duty performance. He argues that \nhis security-significant conduct is not recent and that he has taken steps to see that it does not recur. \nHe also cites to his effort to have the most recent incident expunged from his records, which he \ncontends reduces the likelihood that the incident will come to the attention of those who might try \nto coerce him into revealing classified information. He argues that he has met his burden of \npersuasion as to mitigation.  \nHowever, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable \nadjudication. To the contrary, a Judge must weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the \nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the record, \nis not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00747 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2019). \nThe arguments contained in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief are not sufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s \nmitigation analysis.  We note in particular the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant committed his most \nrecent offense after having had his clearance previously restored with a warning to avoid such \nmisconduct in the future. These sustainable findings weigh heavily against Applicant\u2019s contentions \non appeal. All in all, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis. Moreover, despite \nApplicant\u2019s arguments, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis complied with the \nrequirement of the Directive in that he evaluated Applicant\u2019s case for mitigation in light of the \ntotality of the evidence in the record.

Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under the Guideline B allegations were not raised as an \nissue on appeal. Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether his due process rights \nwere violated and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judges Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his thirties, is a prospective employee of a defense contractor. He \nserved honorably in the U.S. military reserves.  He has never been married and has no children.  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant had six delinquent debts totaling over \n$26,000. He admitted the debts. The debts are reflected in a 2018 credit report. Three became \ndelinquent on or before 2013. The others were reported delinquent in 2015, 2016, and 2018. \nIn 2009, Applicant started a business.  It was initially successful but was later undercut by \na competitor. In trying to keep the business afloat, he incurred debts that he could not pay. \nApplicant sold the business in 2012. \nHe experienced periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. In 2019, he began working for a company and purchased a number of vans for \nthat employment. Applicant lost all but one of the vans when the company\u2019s business declined \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. \nApplicant has hired a credit repair company, but he has not made any payments toward the \ndelinquent debts. He claims that the balance owed on a loan for a repossessed vehicle was paid \nthrough the sale of that vehicle and gap insurance, that two telecommunications companies \n\u201cbasically stole [his] money[,]\u201d and that other creditors could not locate the debts. The alleged \ndebts are not listed on his recent credit report.  Decision at 3.  \nApplicant currently has about $14,000 in a bank account. He had Federal tax delinquencies \nfor 2012 and 2014 that he did not disclose in his 2018 security clearance application. There is no \nindication he disclosed those tax delinquencies during his background interview. He disclosed \nthem at the hearing. Tr. at 51-54 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) D. As of June 2021, he owed the \nIRS about $6,000 in delinquent taxes.  He paid that tax delinquency after the hearing. AE D. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Although he experienced events beyond his \ncontrol that contributed to his financial problems, he did not establish that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay the delinquent debts. Some \nmitigating conditions are not applicable; others only partially apply.

He submits that the Judge did not properly \nconsider or apply the mitigating factors in the case and that he ignored important \nmitigating evidence. Thus, he failed to adequately address important aspects of the \ncase. \nThe Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline F was cursory and he did not \nadequately explain his conclusions or relate them to record evidence or even many \nfavorable finding he made.  [Appeal Brief at 3.] \nRegarding the contention that the record does support the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable findings, \nwe note that Applicant admitted each of the Guideline F allegations in responding to the SOR.  A \n2018 credit report also established those allegations. Having admitted those allegations, Applicant \nwas responsible to present evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising from those \nallegations, and he also had the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a security clearance.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. Given these circumstances, the key issue on review is not whether there was \nsufficient evidence in the record to support the Judge\u2019s unfavorable findings but rather whether \nthe Judge erred in concluding Applicant had not met his burden of production and persuasion to \nmitigate the security concerns. \nAs noted above, Applicant contends the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions was \ncursory in nature. He takes issue with the Judge\u2019s conclusions that a particular mitigating condition \ndid not apply and others only partially applied. In arguing that the Judge\u2019s analysis is flawed, he \npoints to favorable evidence the Judge did not address in his analysis and asserts \u201cthe mitigating \nevidence in this case is substantial and it required a detailed analysis by the Judge as to why it was \ninsufficient to override the government\u2019s doubts as to [his] security worthiness.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n4. We do not find these arguments persuasive. DOHA decisions are not measured against a \nstandard of perfection. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0417 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2000). Judges \nhave broad latitude and discretion in how to write their decisions, provided they issue decisions \nthat (a) comply with pertinent provisions of the Directive, and (b) set forth their findings and \nconclusions with sufficient specificity and clarity that allow the parties and the Board to discern \nwhat the Judge is finding and concluding. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0621 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. \n30, 2002). If the Judge satisfies those requirements, then it does not matter whether the Judge's \ndecision is long or short, or whether particular passages or sections are brief or lengthy. In this \ncase, a reading of the decision below persuades the Board that the Judge: (i) fulfilled his duty to \nconsider the evidence as a whole, and (ii) issued a decision that is consistent with the requirements \nof pertinent provisions of the Directive and allows the parties and the Board to discern what the \nJudge found and concluded. Applicant's dissatisfaction with the Judge's choice to not write more \nextensively about evidence favorable to him is insufficient to demonstrate the Judge acted in a \nmanner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id.  \nApplicant\u2019s brief argues the alleged \u201cdebts are no longer being reported to the credit \nreporting services strongly suggests that the creditors consider these matters resolved.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 5.  In the decision, the Judge correctly cited ISCR Case No. 14-04802 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n21, 2016) for the proposition that a debt falling off a credit report does not establish meaningful, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nindependent evidence as the disposition of that debt. Furthermore, even if a debt is resolved, a \nJudge may still consider the circumstances surrounding the debt, such as lapses in resolving it, for \nwhat they reveal about the applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nApplicant raises a due process issue by asserting the Judge based his decision upon a matter \nnot alleged in the SOR, i.e., the delinquent tax debt. While he notes that non-alleged matters can \nbe considered in the whole-person analysis, he argues the tax debt became the central focus of the \nJudge\u2019s analysis and was likely the basis for the adverse decision. In this regard, he asserts: \nIf the Judge intended to base his adverse Decision on the issue of the tax \ndelinquencies that were cured and were not the subject of the SOR, he had a duty \nto say so explicitly. His failure to do so was error. This is especially true \nconsidering representations he made to [Applicant] during the hearing. The Judge \nand [Applicant] were discussing the option of [Applicant] paying the tax debts that \nwere mentioned during the hearing. \nThe Judge advised that it was purely \n[Applicant\u2019s] decision, but as far as he (the Judge) was concerned, it was the \u201cold \ndebts\u201d (i.e., the SOR debts) that would count in his decision and not the IRS debts \n(Tr. at 63). As things stand now, it appears that the Judge deviated from this \nstatement to [Applicant] when he wrote his Decision. The Decision statement \u201cHis \nfinancial issues are recent\u201d appears directly related to the tax payments as the \nnewest of the SOR debts is more than three years old, the circumstances that caused \nthe debt arrearage are a number of years older still, and the three mitigating \nconditions the Judge found [partially] applicable do not include a temporal element.  \n[Appeal Brief at 7.] \nThis argument is not convincing. In the decision, the Judge stated, \u201cThe SOR did not allege that \nApplicant owed back taxes. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes. It can be used to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, in determining the \napplicability of mitigating conditions, and during the whole-person analysis.\u201d Decision at 3, n.1.  \nThe Judge\u2019s quote is consistent with what the Appeal Board has previously stated on this issue. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). Applicant has not identified \nany reason for the Board to conclude the Judge considered the tax debt as a basis for denying his \nclearance. Regarding the age of the SOR debts, the Board has stated that unpaid, delinquent debts \nconstitute a continuing course of conduct that undermines any claim the debts are not recent within \nthe meaning of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-01309 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 29, 2010). \nWe find no deviation between what the Judge said at the hearing and his analysis in the decision.  \nFrom our reading of the decision, the Judge was referring to the alleged debts when he stated \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent. Applicant has failed to show that he was denied the due \nprocess afforded him under the Directive. \nIn general, Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the evidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMar. 9, 2017).

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 1, 2019, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On \nNovember 2, 2020, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nFor reasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2011 \nthrough 2018 as required and that he had three delinquent debts, i.e., a child support arrearage for \nabout $12,200 and two judgments totaling about $17,700. In responding to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegations with explanations. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his \nwife leaving him in 2010, which resulted in child support payments, custody disputes, and other \nfinancial challenges. \nThe Judge found against Applicant on all of the SOR allegations. She concluded: \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are long-standing, and he acknowledges that he \nhas not resolved some of them. Applicant stated that he settled one debt but he did \nnot provide proof that he paid the settlement amount. Thus, from the record, even \nif he made the payment, he provided no evidence that he made any good-faith efforts \nbefore he received the SOR. He has had his wages garnished for child support \narrearages. Applicant also had not filed his Federal and state income tax returns for \na number of years and is just now getting a preparer to help him file. He has not \nreceived financial counseling. . . . Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved. \nAlthough he promises to address them and states he does not owe that much in \ndelinquent debt, he did not provide proof of debt resolution. [Decision at 5.] \nThe Judge also concluded that, while Applicant has filed his Federal and state income tax returns for \n2018 and 2019, he did not make enough timely progress on filing his tax returns for 2011-2017. \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant raises a number of challenges to the Judge\u2019s decision. He \ncontends the Judge erred in some of her findings of fact. We examine challenged findings of fact to \ndetermine whether they are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept \nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contradictory evidence in the same record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. First, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that \u201che began to address the \ntax filing issues when he learned about his security clearance issues.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4, quoting from \nDecision at 2. He argues that he testified he started addressing these issues when he knew he was \ngoing to have to renew his clearance as opposed to when he received the SOR. This contention \namounts to a matter of semantics. The Judge did not find that Applicant began addressing the tax \nfiling issues when he received the SOR but instead she found he began addressing them \u201cwhen he \nlearned of the security issues.\u201d Applicant would have become aware of the Government\u2019s security \n2 \n\nconcerns regarding his tax filing deficiencies about seventeen months before issuance of the SOR \nwhen he responded to questions in his security clearance application about those deficiencies. This \nchallenge fails to establish any error. \nApplicant also challenges that Judge\u2019s finding that the child support arrearage continues to \nexist and that he and his ex-wife are trying to arrange an agreement that does not involve the child \nsupport system. In challenging this finding, Applicant points out that, as of September 2020, he had \nreduced the arrearage by 21%, that the money is actually owed to his ex-wife with the state acting \nas a collection agency, and that he and his ex-wife are negotiating a change to the child support \npayments that would reflect their current child custody arrangement. His arguments, however, fail \nto establish the Judge erred in this finding because he does not identify any fact that is unsupported \nor incorrect in the finding. Mere disagreement with the manner in which a Judge\u2019s finding is written \ndoes not establish error. When challenging a finding, a party must demonstrate that it is unsupported \nor incorrect to merit relief. Next, he challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he stopped paying \ncondominium fees in 2010 that resulted in a judgment against him. He points out that he testified he \nstopped paying the fees in 2011 and argues the Judge accepted Department Counsel\u2019s assertion about \nwhen the payments stopped without any supporting evidence. While the record supports this \nchallenge, this error was harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nArguing that the Judge did not interpret the evidence in a reasonable manner, Applicant \nchallenges a number of the Judge\u2019s conclusions. We examine challenged conclusions to determine \nwhether they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. First, Applicant \nchallenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that \u201che provided no evidence that he made good-faith efforts [to \nresolve the condominium fee judgment] before he received the SOR.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4, quoting \nfrom Decision at 5. He argues that, in his post-hearing submission (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) B), he \nprovided emails from 2016 and 2017 showing efforts taken to resolve this debt that predate the SOR. \nWe do not find this argument persuasive. The record evidence reveals that the condominium fee \njudgment was entered against Applicant in March 2013. Government Exhibit (GE) 8 at 1. \nGarnishment orders to enforce the judgment were issued in September 2013, June 2015, and May \n2016. Id. at 2, 4, and 5. During a period of unemployment, Applicant\u2019s last garnishment order was \n\u201cDismissed no funds\u201d in June 2017. GE 1 at 15 and GE 8 at 6. The emails that Applicant refers to \nreflect that he had received a court summons, which was apparently to renew the garnishment action. \nAE B at 4. The subsequent email exchanges between Applicant\u2019s father and the creditor to settle the \ndebt were taken after receipt of the court summons. As we have previously stated, the satisfaction \nof a debt through the involuntary establishment of a garnishment is not the same as, or similar to, a \ngood-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 17, 2018). Likewise, we find no error in a conclusion that settlement negotiations fall short of \na \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to resolve the debt when they are initiated in response to a pending court \nsummons. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that he did not receive financial counseling. In \ndoing so, he highlights his testimony in which he referenced the assistance his father provided him \nwith his financial problems as well as the support his father\u2019s personal accountant provided. \n3 \n\nMitigating Condition 20(c) states, \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit counseling service, and \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d Directive, Encl. \n2, App. A \u00b6 20(c). For full credit under this mitigating condition, an applicant must not only show \nthat he or she received financial counseling but also that the financial problem is resolved or is being \nresolved. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03847 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 5, 2020). The pages of the \ntranscript that Applicant cites in support of his arguments on this issue fail to show the Judge erred \nin her ultimate conclusion that Mitigating Condition 20(c) was not established.1 \nApplicant\u2019s other challenges to the Judge\u2019s conclusions, including her whole-person \nassessment, amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence. These arguments \nare insufficient to establish error. It is well settled that an appealing party's ability to interpret record \nevidence in his or her favor does not demonstrate error below.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). In his challenges, he also asserts the Judge did not consider all the \nrecord evidence. There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, \nand the appealing party has a heavy burden when trying to rebut that presumption. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-00110 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). His arguments are insufficient to overcome that \npresumption. In short, the mere fact that a Judge concludes that favorable evidence presented by an \napplicant is not sufficient to outweigh or overcome the unfavorable evidence does not demonstrate \nthat the Judge disregarded or ignored the favorable evidence or improperly weighed the evidence. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nFinally, Applicant contends the \u201cJudge considered testimony that was outside the scope of \nmatters raised in the SOR.\u201d Appeal Brief at 9. Of note, Applicant was the only witness to testify at \nthe hearing. In this assignment of error, the \u201ctestimony\u201d that he cites is actually the questions that \nDepartment Counsel asked him during the hearing. For example, he challenges questions that \nDepartment Counsel asked him about the character of his military service, the foreclosure of a home, \nthe repossession of motorcycle, and the amount of severance pay he received when employment \ncontracts expired. He argues Department Counsel\u2019s \u201ccross-examination was prejudicial and devoid \nof evidence that Counsel was seeking the truth of the issues raised in the SOR.\u201d  Id. at 11. We do \nnot find this argument persuasive. As long as a party\u2019s cross-examination is relevant and material to \nissues in the case, including the whole-person concept, it is proper even if it goes beyond the scope \nof either the direct examination or the SOR allegations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-10347 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 17, 2002). Additionally, there is a rebuttable presumption that Federal officials and \nemployees carry out their duties in good faith. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02592 at 4. Applicant \nhas not identified anything in the record that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to \n1 As a related matter, Applicant contends that neither the Judge nor Department Counsel attempted to \ndetermine whether his father was a legitimate and credible source for financial counseling. In a DOHA proceeding, \nan applicant has the burden to present mitigating evidence. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The Judge and Department Counsel \nhave no obligation to obtain or present mitigating evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02819 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n21, 2020). Similarly, Applicant states in his brief that he \u201chad evidence but did not submit it because he believed it \nwas not needed.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. If he had evidence that would assist him, it was his obligation to present it. \n4 \n\nconclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, unfairly, or unprofessionally in her cross-\nexamination. He has failed to rebut the presumption that she carried out her duties in good-faith. \nApplicant has failed to establish that any harmful error occurred below. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nNicholas T. Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 24, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn February 3, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Judge \nRobert Robinson Gales granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  For reasons stated below, we remand. \nRecord Issue \nAs a threshold matter, a question exists about whether the record of this proceeding is \ncomplete. At the hearing held on December 14, 2020, the Judge requested Department Counsel \nprovide an additional credit report in a post-hearing submission by stating: \nIt\u2019s apparent to me that the OPM investigator had a combined credit report, \nwhich to me is much better than the Equifax credit report, which is -- everything is \nuseless. But if we can get a combined credit report, so we can identify which \naccounts are duplicated, if they are duplicated, that would be helpful.  \nAnd I will give you the same opportunity, for you to submit to me and to \n[Applicant], and so everybody had all the information.  [Tr. at 123.] \nA couple hours after the hearing, Department Counsel sent the Judge an email that had two credit \nreports attached and offered those documents into evidence as Government Exhibit (GE) 4 and 5. \nThose documents consisted of a combined credit report dated March, 21, 2019, and an Equifax credit \nreport dated December 14, 2020. Attachment 4 to Department Counsel\u2019s Appeal Brief. Of note, the \nBoard may consider new evidence on appeal to address a due process issue, including whether the \nrecord is missing evidence that a party presented below. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01011 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). Department Counsel also forwarded the proffered exhibits to Applicant \nseparately.  Department Counsel\u2019s email of December 14, 2020.  \nThe record of the proceeding closed on January 13, 2021 (Decision at 2), and it does not \ncontain the two credit reports that Department Counsel submitted after the hearing ended on \nDecember 14, 2020. In the decision, the Judge identifies the exhibits the parties submitted and that \ndescription does not include the credit reports that Department Counsel proffered as GE 4 and 5. \nA Judge is required to prepare a full and complete record. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.19 and \nE3.1.29. Failure to create or preserve a complete record is error and can impair the Board\u2019s ability \nto perform our review function. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01011 at 3. Because the record appears \nto be incomplete, we are remanding it to the Judge to address this purported error.  \nOther Issues \nDepartment Counsel has raised other issues.  These include: \n2 \n\n1. Department Counsel notes there is an apparent disconnect in the number of Applicant\u2019s \nexhibits (AE).  The decision reflects that AE A through R were admitted into evidence.  Decision \nat 2. In the findings of fact, however, the Judge makes reference to AE S. From our review of \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits, AE S is a duplicate of AE B, i.e., the list of debts in a debt resolution program. \n2. Department Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s comment regarding credit reports. The \nJudge\u2019s comment reads in pertinent part: \n[T]here is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of credit \nreports without obtaining original source documentation to verify entries. Credit \nbureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including public records and \n\u201cother sources,\u201d and it is these other unidentified sources that are the cause of \nconcern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, or merely \nchurned, an individual\u2019s credit history can look worse than it really is. In this \nparticular instance, the credit report referred to numerous creditors for several \ndelinquent accounts. Because of a abbreviated names and acronyms, multiple and \npartial numbers for the same account listed several times under different creditors, \ndebt purchasers, or collection agents, many of those entries are garbled and \nredundant, and have inflated the financial concerns. One can conclude that the \ninformation in the credit report \u2013 actually a summary or secondary evidence \npertaining to an account \u2013 is less accurate, trustworthy, or reliable than other \nevidence of record.  [Decision at 11-12.] \nSince the Judge must issue a new decision, this issue is not yet ripe of adjudication. \n3. Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s mitigation analysis runs counter to the record \nevidence and fails to consider important aspects of the case. They contend the 17 debts listed in \nApplicant\u2019s debt resolution program, including the two that have been resolved, are not debts listed \nin the SOR. More specifically, they challenge to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.q have been resolved. They note that Applicant has multiple accounts with some creditors \nand contend that, because the debt resolution program documentation does not list account numbers, \nit is impossible to determine which accounts are in that program. They also assert that Applicant\u2019s \ninstallment agreements with various creditors do not address any of the alleged debts and none of \nthose agreements reflect that actual payments are being made towards the debts. They further argue \nthe Judge failed in his mitigation analysis to consider Applicant\u2019s current financial circumstances, \nhis taking of international vacations while unemployed, his purchase of an expensive vehicle that \nhe cannot afford to operate, and his acquisition of additional debts. This issue is also not yet ripe \nfor adjudication.   \nConclusion \nThe decision is remanded to the Judge to ensure the record contains all of the post-hearing \ndocuments that were submitted. If additional documents are admitted into evidence, they should be \nconsidered in issuing the new decision that Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35 requires on remand. The Board \n3 \n\nretains no continuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a Judge\u2019s decision issued \nafter remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. and E3.1.30. \nOrder \nThe Decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan          \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.

In general, the \nJudge\u2019s comment runs contrary to well-established evidentiary principles.  Credit reports, as \nbusiness records, have a degree of trustworthiness that generally underlies each hearsay rule \nexception.  The Judge\u2019s comment ignores the degree of trustworthiness that credit reports have \nas business records.  Furthermore, Federal court precedent does not support his concern about \n\u201cother unidentifiable sources\u201d being involved in creating business records. \nAdditionally, the Judge\u2019s comment is based on faulty premises, i.e., generalizations that have no \nfactual basis in the record evidence.  An example of such a generalization is the Judge\u2019s \nstatement about the substantial risk of accepting information in credit reports without verifying \nthe contents of entries by obtaining original source documentation.  Nowhere in the decision \ndoes the Judge point to any specific record evidence to show that particular information in the \ncredit reports is inaccurate or otherwise unreliable.  Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s contention that \noriginal source documentation should be obtained to verify entries in credit reports runs contrary \nto Appeal Board precedent.  It is well settled in DOHA proceedings that parties are entitled to \nrely on the information contained in credit reports and are under no obligation to verify the \naccuracy of that information before presenting it.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nNicholas T. Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 24, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On February 3, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Judge Robert Robinson Gales granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn April 28, 2021, we remanded the case to the Judge to ensure the record contained all of \nthe post-hearing documents that were submitted. On June 28, 2021, the Judge issued a Remand \nDecision in which he again granted Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Department \nCounsel timely appealed the Judge\u2019s Remand Decision. \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues in their latest appeal: whether the Judge \nlacked impartiality, whether the Judge erred in his findings of fact, and whether the Judge\u2019s \ndecision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse. \nApplicant is in his forties and is married with children. He has a master\u2019s degree and served \nhonorably in the military. He has been working in his current position since 2018. He was granted \na security clearance over 25 years ago. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 20 delinquent accounts totaling about $84,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with comments. \u201c[S]ome \nof his admissions were ill-advised and erroneous.\u201d Decision at 3. His financial difficulties started \nabout seven years ago when he was injured in the line of duty. His injury required surgery, and he \nwas out of work for about a year. He incurred a similar injury about a year later. During his \nrecovery periods, he took two vacation trips to the Caribbean. He was initially denied workers\u2019 \ncompensation. His income was reduced until he could return to work full time. He hired an \nattorney to contest the workers\u2019 compensation decision and received a settlement of about $50,000, \nminus about $15,000 in attorney\u2019s fees. He also attributed his financial problems to his ex-wife \nleaving him with nothing but debts.   \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore than three years before the SOR was issued, Applicant hired a law firm to assist him \nin resolving his delinquent debts. He was advised to stop making payments on debts to facilitate \nsettlements and entered into a debt resolution program under which he was to make monthly \npayments of about $850. A good portion of each payment goes toward fees and monthly program \nservices costs. Seventeen debts were listed in the program. \u201cBecause of the way the listed \naccounts appear in Applicant\u2019s debt-resolution program (partial creditor names; some partial \naccount numbers; some full account numbers; and some missing account numbers), it is difficult \nto align the SOR-alleged accounts with those in the debt-resolution program, especially since the \ncredit report on which the SOR-listed allegations are based, also does not fully identify essential \naccount information.\u201d Decision at 5. He relied completely on the financial guidance of the law \nfirm. Misleading statements from the law firm caused him to make inaccurate statements \nregarding his accounts. In mid-2020, Applicant also engaged the services of a credit repair \norganization but failed to provide any report of its activities. \nApplicant resolved four of the alleged debts, is in the process of resolving eight of them, \nand has not resolved eight others. It is unclear whether he has other non-alleged debts. Some of \nthe documents Applicant submitted could not be aligned to alleged debts but it is possible, if not \nprobable, they apply to those debts. Applicant\u2019s monthly income is about $9,100, his monthly \nexpenses are about $4,800, and his monthly debt payments are about $3,200, which leaves him \nabout $1,100 for discretionary purposes. He has not received formal financial counseling but \nreceived financial guidance from the law firm and credit repair organization.  \nMitigating Conditions 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply and 20(c) partially applies. He has \npaid off several accounts, including unalleged debts, and others are in the queue. \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial track record is good. He started focusing on his delinquent accounts years before \nthe SOR was issued.  Overall, the evidence no longer leaves me with any questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\u201d Decision at 16.  \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After \nthe Government produces evidence raising security concerns, an applicant bears the burden of \npersuasion concerning mitigation. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security \nclearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved \nin favor of the national security.\u201d  Directive, Encl 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \n3 \n\n \nCredit Reports \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nDepartment Counsel take issue with the Judge\u2019s comment regarding credit reports. This \ncomment reads in pertinent part: \nWith respect to one of the main evidentiary documents in the record \u2013 the \nSeptember 2019 credit report (GE 2) \u2013 the Appeal Board has explained that it is \n\u201cwell-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the \nsubstantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations under [Directive] \u00b6 \nE3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 26, 2006).\u201d (Emphasis added) It noted that the burden then shifts to the \napplicant to establish either that he is not responsible for the debt or that matters in \nmitigation apply. (ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010)) \nHowever, there is a substantial risk when one accepts, at face value, the contents of \nsome credit reports without obtaining original source documentation to verify \nentries. Credit bureaus collect information from a variety of sources, including \npublic records and \u201cother sources,\u201d and it is these other unidentified sources that \nare the cause of concern. Likewise, when accounts are transferred, reassigned, sold, \nor merely churned, an individual\u2019s credit history can look worse than it really is.  \nIn this particular instance, the September 2019 credit report referred to numerous \ncreditors for several delinquent accounts. Because of abbreviated names and \nacronyms, multiple and partial account numbers for the same account listed several \ntimes under different creditors, debt purchasers, or collection agents, many of those \nentries are garbled or redundant, and have inflated the financial concerns.  One can \nconclude that the information in that particular credit report \u2013 actually a summary \nor secondary evidence pertaining to an account \u2013 might be less accurate, \ntrustworthy, or reliable than the other evidence of record. It certainly does not \nfurnish the information, much less evidence, necessary to make an informed \ndecision. \nThis difficulty has arisen and created unnecessary confusion for \nApplicant, Department Counsel, and this Administrative Judge in aligning alleged \naccounts with documents submitted in mitigation by Applicant. Interestingly, \nChief Department Counsel and Department Counsel argue that \u201cbecause the debt \nresolution does not list account numbers, it is impossible to determine which \naccounts are in that program\u201d \u2013 an argument that could also apply to the fact-\ndeficient GE 2.  [Decision at 13-14.] \nAspects of the Judge\u2019s challenged comment are not sustainable. In general, the Judge\u2019s \ncomment runs contrary to well-established evidentiary principles. Credit reports, as business \nrecords, have a degree of trustworthiness that generally underlies each hearsay rule exception. See \nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a7 286 (8th ed. 2020) and Rothstein, Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 803. \nExceptions to Rule Against Hearsay\u2014Regardless of Whether the Declarant is Available as a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWitness\u2014Rationale of Business Records Exception (3rd ed. 2021)(\u201cThe theory underlying the \ntraditional business records exception was that trustworthiness was somewhat ensured by the \nregularity of the process, by its repetitive nature, by the fact that profits, jobs, or other benefits \nrode on its accuracy, by the usual absence of direct litigation motivation, and by the presumed job \nexpertise of the maker and integrity of the maintenance and storage function. The fact that all \nparticipants in making and storage of the document were acting under a business duty to be honest \nand careful provides a measure of reliability.\u201d). See also United States v. Childs, 5 F.3d 1328, \n1333-1334 (9th Cir. 1993)(noting several Federal circuit courts have held that exhibits are \nadmissible as business records even if other sources are involved in creating those records). The \nJudge\u2019s comment ignores the degree of trustworthiness that credit reports have as business records.  \nFurthermore, Federal court precedent does not support his concern about \u201cother unidentifiable \nsources\u201d being involved in creating business records. \nAdditionally, the Judge\u2019s comment is based on faulty premises, i.e., generalizations that \nhave no factual basis in the record evidence. An example of such a generalization is the Judge\u2019s \nstatement about the substantial risk of accepting information in credit reports without verifying the \ncontents of entries by obtaining original source documentation.  Nowhere in the decision does the \nJudge point to any specific record evidence to show that particular information in the credit reports \nis inaccurate or otherwise unreliable. Furthermore, the Judge\u2019s contention that original source \ndocumentation should be obtained to verify entries in credit reports runs contrary to Appeal Board \nprecedent. It is well settled in DOHA proceedings that parties are entitled to rely on the \ninformation contained in credit reports and are under no obligation to verify the accuracy of that \ninformation before presenting it. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08925 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2008). \nA Judge, as the trier of fact, must weigh the evidence. In doing so, a Judge does not have \nunfettered discretion and must not weigh the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. As noted above, a Judge\u2019s conclusions are arbitrary and \ncapricious, for example, if they fail to articulate a satisfactory explanation, including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made; they reflect a clear error of judgment; \nthey offer an explanation that runs contrary to the record evidence; or they are so implausible that \nthey cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3\u00ad\n4. A Judge\u2019s conclusions are arbitrary and capricious when they are based on unfounded findings \nor assertions, i.e., those not based on substantial evidence in the record. In this case, it was arbitrary \nand capricious for the Judge to conclude that credit reports are \u201cless accurate, trustworthy, or \nreliable than\u201d some unspecified or hypothetical \u201cother evidence of record.\u201d Nowhere in the \ndecision does the Judge identify that \u201cother evidence of record.\u201d As we have previously stated, a \nJudge's decision must set forth findings and conclusions with sufficient specificity and clarity that \nthe parties and the Board can discern what the Judge is finding and concluding. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 99-0018 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 1999). In the challenged comment, the Judge\u2019s \ngeneralized conclusion about \u201cother evidence of record\u201d\u2014that fails to identify or discuss any \nspecific record evidence showing why a specific credit report or its entries are unreliable\u2014is not \nsustainable as written. If there was evidence that showed information in the credit reports was \ninaccurate or unreliable, the Judge should have identified those specific deficiencies in the record \nevidence. By not identifying those specific deficiencies, the Judge\u2019s contention about the \nunspecified \u201cother evidence of record\u201d is unfounded and amounts to speculation.  \n5 \n\n \nFindings of Fact \n \nImpartiality \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom our review of the credit reports in the record, we see no basis for the Judge\u2019s \nconcerns. The Judge erred in finding the September 2019 credit report (GE 2) contained only \npartial account numbers for the debts alleged in the SOR. To the contrary, GE 2 contains full \naccount number for those debts. We also note the SOR debts are trackable in the other credit \nreports in the record. All in all, credit reports, absent evidence to the contrary, are considered \nreliable as a business record and can be used to establish delinquent debts alleged in an SOR. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3. \nDepartment Counsel cite a number of the Judge\u2019s previous decisions in which he used the \nsame or similar version of the above-challenged comment and contend the Judge has a \u201cdistrust\u201d \nand \u201cpersonal disdain\u201d of credit reports. Appeal Brief at 13. To the extent that Department \nCounsel are arguing that the Judge lacked impartiality, we do not find that argument persuasive. \nImpartiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge has committed error. Proof of error, \nstanding alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or lacked impartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 04-09239 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006). \nA key issue in Department Counsel\u2019s brief is whether the Judge erred in finding certain \ndebts alleged in the SOR were enrolled in Applicant\u2019s debt resolution program (DRP). We \nexamine a Judge\u2019s challenged findings to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, that is, \n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in \nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nFrom our reading of the decision, the Judge found that ten of the debts alleged in the SOR \nwere enrolled in the DRP. Department Counsel, on the other hand, contend that none of the alleged \ndebts \u201ccan be unambiguously keyed\u201d to those enrolled in Applicant\u2019s DRP. Appeal Brief at 10.  \nWe agree with Department Counsel that some of the Judge\u2019s findings in question are not \nsustainable. \nAn example of this issue is the Judge\u2019s findings involving three SOR debts from the same \ncreditor, a bank. A credit report (GE 5) reflects Applicant had three delinquent credit card debts \nfrom the bank in the amounts of $10,102, $740, and $634. In his SOR Answer submitted in March \n2020, Applicant provided DRP documents that reflect one debt from the bank was enrolled in the \nprogram. The DRP documents also indicate that the debt was settled, but they fail to provide an \naccount number or other identifying information for the debt. Applicant claimed all three debts \nwere being handled by the DRP but submitted no corroborating documentation.

Presumably, he concluded the other debt was not enrolled and \nwas not being resolved, but he made no finding of that nature.  \nWe are puzzled by the Judge\u2019s findings.  First, we do not understand how the Judge could \nfind two of the bank\u2019s debts were enrolled in the DRP when only one is listed. Second, although \none of the bank\u2019s debts was most likely enrolled in the DRP, which one cannot be determined \nbased on the evidence presented. A finding that one or more of the specific debts were enrolled \namounts to mere speculation. A finding cannot be based solely on speculation. Having admitted \nthe bank debts, Applicant had the burden of producing evidence to show which debts were resolved \nor mitigated. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Under these circumstances, the Judge erred in finding particular \nSOR debts from the bank were enrolled in the DRP. Third, Department Counsel offered into \nevidence a credit report that was pulled on the date of the hearing in December 2020. The \ninformation in this credit report was at least ten months more current than the DRP information. \nThis credit report reflects that the balances of the three bank debts remained the same as alleged, \nwhich contradicts with DRP entry indicating one of the debts was settled. In his findings, the \nJudge erred in failing to address this contradictory information in the credit report. \nBased on our review, the record contains insufficient evidence to support the Judge\u2019s \nfindings that three other SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.q) were enrolled in the DRP.  \nConsidering also the two purportedly enrolled bank debts discussed above, the Judge erred in \nfinding five debts totaling over $32,000 were enrolled in the DRP.  Furthermore, the Judge found \nthat eight other debts totaling over $9,000 were not enrolled in the DRP and were not resolved. \nFor another debt (SOR \u00b6 1.r) the Judge found Applicant was in the process of resolving it even \nthough he submitted no documentary evidence supporting that claim. In summary, there are 14 \nSOR debts totaling over $41,000 for which Applicant failed to offer sufficient documentary \nevidence to establish he is taking action to resolve them.      \nDepartment Counsel also contends the Judge erred in his analysis of various mitigating \nconditions. For example, they argue the Judge failed to consider important aspects of the case in \nconcluding Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Besides the two Caribbean \nvacations for which the Judge made findings, Department Counsel point out that Applicant \nborrowed $61,000 to purchase a vehicle in early 2020. Tr. at 101. They also note Applicant was \nmaking minimum monthly payments on about $30,000 in credit card debt. Tr. at 94-95. \nAdditionally, the credit report pulled on the date of the hearing also shows Applicant has another \nvehicle loan with a balance of $24,000. GE 4 at 6. The Judge did not address this evidence in his \ndecision. We agree with Department Counsel that these were important aspects of the case that \nthe Judge should have addressed in his mitigation analysis.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge erred in finding some of the substantial SOR debts were enrolled in Applicant\u2019s \nDRP.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nGerard Arcilla, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 3, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F (Financial \n\nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant initially requested a decision on the written record but later requested a hearing. On \nFebruary 10, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied due process and \nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. The Judge\u2019s \nfavorable findings under Guideline B were not raised as an issue on appeal. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Pertinent Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant, who is in his mid-30s, is married with children. He has earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree and is seeking a security clearance for his employment with a defense contractor. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has ten delinquent debts totaling about $100,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, he admitted eight of the alleged debts. Credit reports confirm the alleged \ndebts. In late 2015, Applicant encountered financial problems, such as tenants vacating his wife\u2019s \nrental property due to a gas leak, that resulted in his earnings not being sufficient to cover his bills. \nHis mortgage fell into arrears, but it is now current. In 2017, he hired a credit repair company that \nassisted him in setting up a financial plan to resolve his delinquent debts.  Although he started the \nplan, he was unable to complete it due to an unexpected financial setback.   \nApplicant has been employed since the spring of 2019.  In late 2019, he hired another debt \nmanagement company. He believes they are negotiating with creditors to reduce his debts, and their \npayment plan places him on a path to avoid bankruptcy. However, the pandemic has impacted his \nearnings and his ability to pay the past-due debts. He plans to pay the debts when he has the money \nto do so and notes some of the debts are no longer owed or appear on his credit report. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems.  Circumstances beyond his control, such as \nloss of employment, have contributed to those problems. He has made some attempts to repay his \ndebts. However, with the exception of bringing his mortgage current, little has changed with his \nfinancial situation over the past several years. He hired a debt management company and expressed \nan intent to resolve his debts but did not present adequate evidence to show meaningful progress in \nresolving most of the debts. While he has received letters of recommendation from military and \nprofessional associates praising his work performance, including during tours in combat zones, he \nhas fallen short of mitigating the alleged Guideline F security concerns.     \nDiscussion \nDue Process Issue \n2 \n\nApplicant contends that the Judge issued the decision before the record was scheduled to \nclose. Applicant represented himself at the hearing below, which was held on November 13, 2020. \nAt the hearing, the Judge indicated that the record of the proceeding would be left open until \nNovember 30, 2020. Tr. at 98-100.  Department Counsel requested that Applicant\u2019s post-hearing \nsubmission should be submitted to an email address monitored by two clerks who would forward \nthe submission to him. Tr. at 99-100. The record contains no additional communications from the \nJudge or the parties regarding the closure of the record. In the decision, the Judge noted that the \nrecord was left open until January 27, 2021, and that Applicant submitted no additional \ndocumentation. \nBecause the decision reflects the record closed on a date later than the one indicated in the \ntranscript, it is reasonable to conclude that communications occurred between the Judge and the \nparties modifying the closure date of the proceeding that are not contained in the record.  A Judge \nis required to create and preserve a complete record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03043 at 3 (App. \nBd. Mar. 12, 2019), citing Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.19 and E3.1.29. This requirement includes adding to \nthe record any communications between the Judge and parties after the hearing regarding post-\nhearing submissions or modification of the date in which the record is scheduled to close. Failure \nto include such post-hearing communications in the record can impair the Board\u2019s ability to perform \nits review function. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains assertions and documents that are not contained in the \nrecord. The Appeal Board is generally precluded from considering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.29. However, we will considered new evidence insofar as it bears upon questions of due \nprocess or jurisdiction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). Applicant \ncontends the record was scheduled to close on February 13, 2021. In support of this assertion, \nApplicant provided screen shots from his cell phone reflecting that he apparently talked to one of the \nDOHA clerks on January 13, 2021, and also sent an email to the clerk\u2019s address on that date \nrequesting a 30-day extension of the deadline for submitting additional documents. Exhibit B of \nAppeal Brief. He submitted no document showing that request was granted. He also provided a \nscreen shot of an email sent to the clerk\u2019s address on February 12, 2021, reflecting that he submitted \nsomething to be downloaded. Id. This later email was sent two days after the Judge had already \nissued the decision in this case.  \nIn his reply brief, Department Counsel provided an email chain reflecting messages sent to \n\uffad\n\u00ad\nday extension request of January 13, 2021, and the clerk\u2019s response to it sent that same day, which \nreads in pertinent part: \nORDER OF THE COURT \nApplicant\u2019s request for an extension to submit Post-Hearing Exhibits is granted for \ntwo weeks from today\u2019s date.  Applicant has until close of business on January 27, \n2020 [sic], to submit this documentation.  No further extensions will be granted. \n3 \n\nJudge Lokey-Anderson  [Appendix 1 of Reply Brief at 1.] \nEven though this message contains an obvious error regarding the year in which the record would \nclose, this error was not misleading given the context of the message. \nA party has no right to have the record kept open indefinitely so that he or she can \ncontinuously submit new evidence for the Judge\u2019s consideration. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0250 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb.13, 2001)(quoting Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 554-555 (1978)).  \u201c[T]here must be some reasonable degree \nof administrative finality in DOHA adjudications.\u201d Id. The abuse of discretion standard is used to \nreview a Judge\u2019s decision whether or not to leave the record open for submission of additional \nmatters. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-00164 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2018).  In this case, we find \nno error in the Judge\u2019s decision to leave the record open until January 27, 2021.  \nFurthermore, Applicant has not provided the evidence he believes would have mitigated the \nJudge\u2019s concerns. Even if we had accepted his assertions about the closing of the record, we would \nhave no basis to conclude that Applicant\u2019s proposed evidence would likely have made a difference. \nBased on the foregoing, Applicant has failed to show the record was scheduled to close on \nFebruary 13, 2021, as he contends. He has not demonstrated that he submitted post-hearing matters \nbefore the deadline that the Judge established.  We conclude that Applicant has failed to establish \nthat he was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive.    \nAnalytical Issues \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nRather, he contends the Judge failed to adhere to Executive Order 10865 and the Directive by not \nconsidering all of the record evidence and by not properly applying the mitigating conditions and \nwhole-person concept. Applicant, however, has failed to identify any specific record evidence, \nmitigating condition, or whole-person factor that the Judge purportedly did not consider. His \narguments are neither sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record nor enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). \nConclusion \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department \nof the Navy v.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant has worked for Federal contractors since the early 1990s. She has a long history \nof delinquent debts and financial instability. She received Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges in 1996, \n2011, and 2019. \nOver the years, Applicant experienced layoffs when her employers lost contracts. She also \nhad a difficult marriage that impacted her finances. She funded higher education for herself and her \ntwo children and \u201chas long had several hundred thousand dollars in unresolved student loan debt \nthat she has never put forth a serious effort to pay.

On April \n10, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014securityconcerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On October 8, 2020, \nafter considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nWilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant \nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that, while granted access to classified information, \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about 1975 to 1982 and from about late 2016 \nto late 2019. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his responses to illegal \ndrug-activityquestions in a 2017 securityclearance application. Inresponding to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted each allegation with explanations. The Judge found against Applicant on all of the SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains information from outside the record. The Appeal Board is \nprohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nIn the appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge based his decision on errors in Department \nCounsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM). Specifically, he challenges Department Counsel\u2019s \nstatements that \u201cApplicant has a Substantial [sic] history of illegal drug abuse\u201d and \u201cApplicant has \nConsistently [sic] used marijuana while he held a security clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. This \ncontention lacks merit. The Appeal Board\u2019s scope of review is limited to determining whether the \nJudge committed harmful error. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. An error in a FORM, as opposed to one in a \nJudge\u2019s decision, is not an appealable issue. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-00535 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. \n13, 2017). \nApplicant also contends that the Judge penalized him for choosing to have his decision based \non the written record instead of on a hearing. He is apparently basing this contention on the Judge\u2019s \nfinding of fact that states, \u201cI was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person \nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.\u201d Decision at 3. In this regard, the \nAppeal Board has long held that when an applicant waives a hearing and chooses to have his or her \ncase decided by the Judge based on the written record, the Judge has no ability to make a credibility \ndetermination based on observation of the applicant\u2019s demeanor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02819 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). Moreover, an applicant, even if pro se, is generally responsible for \nthe consequences of his or her decisions. Id. In this case, Applicant has failed to establish the Judge \ncommitted any error by merely noting a consequence of his forum choice. \nApplicant points out the Judge found that he did not submit any evidence of the quality of his \njob performance or other evidence tending to establish his good judgment, trustworthiness, and \n2 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability. Applicant argues that he has worked as a Government employee or a contractor for many \nyears, did not understand that he should have submitted job performance records or other character \nevidence, and contends the initial instructions to him were not clear. To the extent that he is arguing \nthat he was denied due process or was not provided adequate notice of his responsibilities, we do not \nfind that argument persuasive. Applicant was provided a copy of the Directive when he received the \nSOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d In the FORM and its forwarding letter, Applicant was informed that, unless he presented \nadditional information, the Judge would base his decision solely upon the information contained in \nthe FORM. Neither Department Counsel nor the Judge had a duty to obtain or present mitigating \nevidence. See ISCR Case No 19-02819 at 3. If Applicant wanted the Judge to consider any form \nof character evidence, it was his responsibility to provide it to him. Applicant has failed to establish \nthat he was denied the due process afforded him under the Directive. \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to properly apply the whole-person concept. For \nexample, he argues that his use of marijuana never negatively impacted his professional conduct, that \nhis prior long period of abstinence from marijuana demonstrates his ability to refrain from it; that his \nmore recent use of marijuana was due to medical issues and stress and occurred during a period of \ndiminished mental health, that he has worked with a doctor to make permanent behavioral changes, \nand that he could never be pressured into compromising national security. These arguments amount \nto a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not enough to show the Judge \nreached conclusions that are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Id. at 5. Furthermore, we note \nthat Applicant has not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings or conclusions that he falsified his security \nclearance application, which is a sufficient independent basis to deny his request for a security \nclearance. \nApplicant failed to establishthat the Judge committed anyharmfulerror. The Judge examined \nthe relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

On July 9, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his thirties, is unmarried with a minor child, and has earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He began working for a Federal contractor in 2018. His supervisors describe him as \nhonest, forthcoming, dependable, and responsible. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent debts totaling over $36,400. In \nresponding to the SOR, he admitted each allegation. He experienced conditions beyond his control \nthat contributed to his financial problems, such as raising a child while attending college, helping \nhis mother financially, and short periods of unemployment, but he did not act reasonably under \ncircumstances.  In early 2021, he entered into a five-month contract with a debt relief company to \nnegotiate settlements with creditors. The company advised him to pay the smaller debts first as he \nworked his way up to the larger ones. Following that advice, he resolved two of the debts totaling \nnearly $4,000 after the SOR was issued, but the other debts remained unresolved. The unresolved \ndebts include the balance owed on a repossessed car, credit card delinquencies, and student loans. \nOnly after the hearing did he initiate action to rehabilitate the student loans. With the exception \nof his contract with the debt relief company, he presented no evidence that he received financial \ncounseling. His indebtedness is recent, ongoing, and not under control. His actions to resolve the \ndebts are \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d  Decision at 6.     \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends the Judge erred in finding the car repossession occurred in 2018.  \nApplicant asserts the car was repossessed in 2016. Credit reports reflect that the last activity on \nthis debt occurred in either 2016 or 2018. Government Exhibit (GE) 3 at 2, GE 4 at 1, and GE 5 \nat 4. In his background interview, Applicant reportedly stated the car was repossessed in 2016. \nGE 2 at 5. Even though the Judge may have erred in his finding about the year of the car \nrepossession, it was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. He argues, for example, that his debts are old and he is now in a better financial \nposition that permits him to focus on resolving them. Additionally, he highlights the conditions \nbeyond his control that contributed to his financial problems, points out that his debt relief contract \nwas the only form of evidence he had of financial counseling, and emphasizes his good security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord.

Applicant also notes that loss of a security clearance may affect his \nemployment, but the Directive does not permit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable \ndecision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01206 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2020).  \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors.

Applicant had never met Mr. E but agreed to help him. \nBetween October and December 2016, numerous bank transactions occurred, mostly through a bank \naccount that Applicant and his wife maintained for an unsuccessful business venture (Company H) \nthat remained in existence.   \nApplicant testified that he would wire funds for Mr. E to various foreign bank \naccounts, in South Africa, China, and Turkey, as well as Nigeria. (Tr. 129-130, 160, \n175-176, 184, 243-244; GE 2 [Applicant\u2019 background interview] at 9) Applicant did \nnot know any of the people he transacted with. (Tr. 130) The deposits often \ninvolved large sums of money, almost always well over $10,000 and at times over \n2 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n$100,000. (Tr. 130-131, 156-158, 173, 202) Applicant would then wire the \ndeposited funds to Mr. E\u2019s client, the travel company, or to other foreign accounts. \n(GE 4 [transcripts of text messages] at 2) Most of the funds were in U.S. dollars but \nsome of the funds were in \u201cnaira,\u201d a Nigerian currency. (Tr. 143-146) [Decision at \n5.] \nIn November 2016, Applicant informed Mr. E that Company H was not licensed to deal in currency \nand the wiring of large amounts of money into that company\u2019s account would eventually be flagged. \nAbout a week later, the bank closed the account and refunded him the balance by check.     \nApplicant testified at the time he began the transactions with Mr. E, he \n\u201cthought nothing of it\u201d because it seemed like something legitimate.\u201d  (50-51) He \nsaid he \u201cjust thought I was doing my wife a favor. And then it turned into a \nnightmare.\u201d (Tr. 75) Applicant also testified that while he was engaged in the \ntransactions with Mr. E, he became concerned about them. He testified that he \n\u201cdidn\u2019t want to have anything to do with any kind of fraud. I told him this on \nnumerous occasions.\u201d He said the only reason he did it was because his wife \nrecommended it.  (Tr. 241, 242).  [Decision at 5.] \nApplicant is close to his cousin Mr. O in Nigeria. In 2019, Applicant made several deposits \ntotaling about $72,000 in U.S. bank accounts for his cousin Mr. O. From that money, Applicant \npurchased a luxury vehicle and shipped it to his cousin in Nigeria.   \nNigeria is challenged by terrorist activity, sectarian violence, and human-rights abuses. \nOrganizations such as Boko Haram and ISIS operate in Nigeria, attack state and civilian targets, and \nseek to replace the Nigerian Government. A large segment of the population lives in extreme \npoverty. Financial scams, which are often initiated through the internet, are prevalent in Nigeria. \nSome of these scams involve money transfers. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s Nigerian familymembers create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or coercion \nand could become a basis for him to be placed in a conflict of interest. He failed to mitigate the \nforeign influence security concerns.  \nApplicant\u2019s bank account was frozen due to suspicious transactions that he made for Mr. E. \nThese transactions reflect a pattern of poor judgment that is difficult to mitigate. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s adverse findings and \nconclusions regarding the Guideline B allegations. Instead, he challenges some of the Judge\u2019s \nadverse findings regarding the Guideline E allegation. When a Judge\u2019s findings are challenged, we \nexamine them to see if they are supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \na reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. See also ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2018).  \nApplicant challenges, for example, the following finding, \u201cApplicant utilized several of his \naccounts at multiple U.S. banks for these transactions.\u201d He contends he used only the bank that held \nhis Company H\u2019s account for those transactions.  We do not find this challenge persuasive. In his \ntestimony, he stated that he was using various branches from two banks to conduct these \ntransactions. Tr. at 159 and170. See also GE at 9. Having reviewed each of Applicant\u2019s challenges, \nthe Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions regarding the bank \ntransactions at issue are based on substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or \ninferences that could be drawn from the record. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. \nJan. 14, 2020).  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the \ncase.  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found \nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nFebruary 6, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On July \n19, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 15 delinquent debts totaling about $43,500 and that \nhe had three bankruptcy filings. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted ten of the SOR \nallegations with explanations and denied the others. The Judge found against Applicant on each \nSOR allegation. The Judge concluded that Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe alleged security concerns. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is unfair \nbecause it does not address a Federal law, regulations, and policies on race, age discrimination, \nand diversity; whether the Judge erred in failing to address unfair practices involving minorities in \nthe financial industry; whether the Judge was biased; and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm the Judge\u2019s \ndecision. \nDiscrimination Issues \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief raises two discrimination issues. First, he contends the Judge\u2019s \ndecision violates DoD policy because it did not address the following: (1) Civil Rights Act of 1964, \nPub. L. 88-352, (2) Executive Order 12067, Providing for Coordination of Federal Equal \nOpportunity Programs, (3) DoD Directive 1020.02E, Diversity Management and Equal \nOpportunity in the DoD, (4) DoD Directive 5500.11, Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted \nPrograms, (5) DoD Instruction 1020.05, DoD Diversity and Inclusion Management Program, (6) \nMilitary Leadership Diversity Commission, Issue Paper #23, Military Occupations and \nImplications of Racial/Ethnic and Gender Diversity, (7) DoD Board on Diversity and Inclusion \nReport, Recommendation to Improve Racial and Ethnic Diversity and Inclusion in the U.S. \nMilitary, and (8) DoD Directive 5220.6. (identified above as the Directive) \u204b 6.3.3. Applicant \ncontends these authorities and policies are relevant to his case. We interpret this assignment of \nerror as Applicant claiming the Judge\u2019s decision is contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. ISCR \n02-20115 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005)(the Board will consider whether the Judge\u2019s decision \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontravenes the provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable Federal \nlaw in determining if it is contrary to law.). \nThe Appeal Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether \nthe Judge committed factual or legal error. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32 \u2013 E3.1.32.3. There is no \npresumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and \nidentify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-12199 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). Based on our review of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief, we are \nunable to discern the basis for his claim that the Judge violated DoD policy. His brief merely cites \nsix of the above-listed authorities and policies and quotes provisions from the other two authorities, \ni.e., the \u201cPurpose\u201d paragraphs in DoD Directive 1020.02E and DoD Instruction 1020.05 and the \n\u201cData Collection and Requirements\u201d paragraph of the latter instruction. His brief does not explain \nhow the cited authorities or the quoted provisions apply to his case. Beyond that, however, he \ndoes not identify any specific DoD requirement or policy the Judge supposedly violated. In short, \nthis assignment of error fails for a lack of specificity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03372 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2018) (discussing the reasons why assignments of error must be set forth with \nspecificity).  Applicant\u2019s assertions fail to establish the Judge\u2019s decision is contrary to law. \nRegarding the second discrimination issue in his brief, Applicant notes there are \u201cnon-\nethnic friendly activities of the financial industry including credit reporting agencies, lending \ninstitutions and unfair practices to minorities in certain ethic (sic) group, i.e. Black/African \nAmericans, and Hispanic Americans.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. If Applicant intended this statement to \nconstitute an allegation of error, it fails because he did not assert, establish, or indicate how any of \nhis financial problems alleged in the SOR were the result of, or impacted by, any unfair practices \nin the financial industry toward minorities. This assignment of error also fails for a lack of \nspecificity. \nBias \nApplicant\u2019s brief raises the issue of the Judge\u2019s impartiality. He notes that the Judge served \nwith Department Counsel in the military and that he, having served in the military, has direct \npersonal experience with unfair behavior. \nTo the extent that he is claiming the Judge lacked \nimpartiality or was biased against him, we do not find this argument persuasive. At the beginning \nof the hearing, the Judge noted he served as Department Counsel\u2019s military supervisor in \napproximately 1995. On the record, both the Judge and Department Counsel agreed they have not \nworked together since then and have not interacted personally or professionally in at least a couple \nof decades. Applicant was given an opportunity to express an objection and responded: \u201cYour \nhonor, I have no objection at all. You know I\u2019m happy to be in the same room with two fellow \nshipmates. You know, and I appreciate your honest and candor. Thank you.\u201d Tr. at 8-9. Having \nhad the opportunity to object at the hearing, Applicant cannot now object merely because the Judge \nrendered an unfavorable decision. \nApplicant has not directed our attention to anything in the \nrecord that would likely persuade a reasonable person that the Judge was lacking in the requisite \nimpartiality. His argument fails to meet the heavy burden on him to rebut the presumption that a \nJudge is impartial and unbiased. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd.

These \narguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence and are not enough \nto rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or to \ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). He also notes \nthat loss of his security clearance will disrupt his life. On this last point, the Directive does not \npermit us to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at \n3 (App. Bd.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. \nOn March 17, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for\nthat decision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On October 27, 2020, after considering the record,\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Gina L. Marine denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether she was denied due process,\nwhether the Judge erred in her findings of fact, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.\nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis\nApplicant, who is in her 50s, has two adult children.  She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in the\nlate 80s.  She was granted a security clearance in the mid-2000s and has submitted her first\napplication for a public trust position.  Although currently unemployed, her public trust position\napplication is being sponsored by a prospective employer.   \nApplicant admitted the 12 delinquent debts totaling about $58,900 that are alleged in the\nSOR.  These debts include Federal taxes totaling about $10,600, nine credit card accounts totaling\nabout $45,700, a vehicle loan, and a utility bill.  The debts remain unresolved.  In 2015, Applicant\nconsulted with an attorney about filing bankruptcy but declined to do so.  She plans to \u201cchip away\u201d\nat the debts once she becomes gainfully employed and expects the debts will be resolved \u201cin no\ntime.\u201d  Decision at 2.  \nApplicant has experienced periods of unemployment and underemployment.  She was\nunemployed for about two months in 2012, about 11 months between 2013 and 2014, and about ten\nmonths between 2018 and 2019.  Her salary significantly decreased in some of her subsequent jobs. \nShe has been unemployed since late 2019.  During her periods of employments, she withdrew funds\nfrom her retirement account and used credit cards to pay bills.  While unemployed, she also relied\non unemployment benefits and loans from family members. \nSince 2017, Applicant has not incurred any new debts or opened new accounts.  She is\nmanaging her current finances responsibly.  She owns a home with first and second mortgages that\nare in good standing.  She has student loans totaling about $21,500 that are in a deferment status. \nShe has a vehicle loan that is in good standing.  Applicant resolved a Federal tax debt for 2012, but\nstill owes past-due taxes for tax years 2014 through 2016.  She has established installment\nagreements for her past-due taxes that have lapsed and has had her tax refunds withheld.  For a\nperiod, a portion of her Federal tax debt was \u201cnot collectable.\u201d  Decision at 4.  She filed late her\nFederal income tax returns for 2016 through 2018, filing her 2016 and 2018 returns in late 2019. \nHer tax filing deficiencies were not alleged in the SOR and will only be considered in evaluating her\n2\n\nmitigation and whole-person evidence.  She has had Federal tax liens filed against her and a state\nhas garnished her pay for delinquent taxes.  Her state tax debt has been resolved.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions were fully established.  \u201cHowever sincere [Applicant] may\nbe in her determination to resolve her delinquent debts without filing bankruptcy,\u201d insufficient\nevidence has been presented to show that she will be able to follow through on her plan to repay the\nSOR debts once she is gainfully employed or to establish her indebtedness is unlikely to recur. \nDecision at 7-8.  \nDiscussion\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29 provides that the Appeal Board is prohibited from considering new\nevidence on appeal.  In her appeal brief, Applicant acknowledges that she cannot submit new\nevidence.  Yet, her brief contains new evidence.  \nRegarding the new evidence prohibition, two matters merit noting.  First, Applicant makes\nfactual assertions in her brief that go beyond the record evidence.  For example, she details reasons\nthat are not in the record for why she did not file bankruptcy.  Such factual assertions constitute new\nevidence.  The Board will only consider arguments in Applicant\u2019s appeal brief that are based on\nrecord evidence.  Second, Applicant\u2019s brief highlights comments the Judge made in the decision\nabout the lack of documentation corroborating her claims, and she indicates she could provide such\ndocumentation.  The new evidence prohibition extends to Applicant\u2019s proffer to submit additional\ndocumentation to the Board. \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant raises 16 assignments of error.  Ten of those assignments\naddress the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and the other six address her analysis and conclusions.  We\nexamine a challenge to the legal sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s finding to see if it is supported by\nsubstantial evidence, that is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate\nto support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1.  See also, ADP Case No. 14-04509 at 2, n.1 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2016).  We examine a \nchallenge to a Judge\u2019s analytical inferences or conclusions to determine whether they are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nOf Applicant\u2019s 16 assignments of error, two of them can be considered a challenge to the\nlegal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  As to these challenges, Applicant first contends that\nthe Judge erred in finding she was submitting her first application for a public trust position.  In her\nargument, she cites her personal subject interview that reflects she started the process of obtaining\na public trust position while working for a prior employer in 2017 and 2018 but was laid off before\ncompleting the process.  Item 4 at 9 of the File of Relevant Material (FORM).  On the other hand,\nher Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) of January 2019 lists that she\nwas investigated for a security clearance in 2004 and that she was not processed for any other\ninvestigations.  Item 3 at 34 of the FORM.  Even if the Judge erred in making this challenged\nfinding, it was a harmless error because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case.  See, e.g.,\nADP Case No. 13-01074 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2014).  Applicant also contends that the Judge\n3\n\nerred in finding she has not sought any financial counseling.  She argues that her consultation with\nthe bankruptcy attorney constituted financial counseling.  Based on our review of the evidence, there\nis no reason to conclude the Judge erred in this challenged finding because the record contains no\ndetails of the substance of her discussions with the attorney.  Furthermore, her personal subject\ninterview reflects \u201c[she] is not seeking credit counseling services.\u201d  Item 4 at 9 of the FORM. \nApplicant speculates that she would have received a clearance had she filed for bankruptcy\nin 2015.  Although the Board cannot possibly adjudicate a hypothetical case, we see no reason to\nconcur with such speculation.  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s assignments of error, including those addressing other findings\nof fact, amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence.  In these arguments,\nApplicant essentially sets forth her views of how the evidence should be interpreted.  A party\u2019s\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, however, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case 19-02087 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2020). \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant states that she did not request a hearing due to the coronavirus\npandemic and that she did not understand the need to provide documentation to support her\nmitigation claims.  To the extent that she is claiming she was denied due process, we do not find that\nargument persuasive.  Applicant had adequate notice of the adjudication procedures.  She was\nprovided a copy of the Directive when she received the SOR.  Enclosure 3 of the Directive explains\nthe differences between a hearing and a decision based on the written record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nprovides \u201c[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  Applicants, including\npro se applicants, are responsible for the consequences of their decisions.  See, e.g., ADP Case No.\n18-00679 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2019).  The reason behind Applicant\u2019s forum choice raises no\nappealable issue, and the Government bears no responsibility for Applicant\u2019s failure to present\nmitigating evidence.  Based on our review of the record, Applicant has failed to establish that she\nwas denied the due process afforded her under the Directive.  \n   \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error below.  The Judge\nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The\ndecision is sustainable on this record.  The standard applicable to trustworthiness cases is that set\nforth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding security clearances:\nsuch a determination \u201c. . . may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 19-02087 at 3.

On \nFebruary 5, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On January 13, 2021, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in finding Applicant \nfalsified her security clearance application (SCA) and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nApplicant, who is her 20s, has been working for his current employer since 2017. She was \ngranted a security clearance in late 2017. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom October 2011 to April 2018, that she used marijuana while granted access to classified \ninformation, and that she intends use marijuana in the future. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged \nshe falsified a SCA in November 2017 when she responded \u201cNo\u201d to a question that asked whether \nshe used illegal drugs in the past seven years. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegations regarding her prior use of marijuana and denied the allegations regarding her intention \nto use of marijuana in the future and the SCA falsification. The Judge found against Applicant on \nall of the SOR allegations.  \nApplicant began smoking marijuana about twice a week in college to calm her anxiety. Such \nuse was lawful in that state. She stopped using marijuana after moving to a state where its use was \nillegal. In a background interview, Applicant stated she used marijuana while holding a security \nclearance in 2017, but denied that allegation at the hearing, claiming she did not understand the \nquestion. Applicant stopped associating with people who use marijuana, obtained a psychological \nevaluation, and signed a statement of intent not to use marijuana in the future. \nIn 2017, Applicant completed a SCA in which she denied using illegal drugs in the past seven \nyears. She knew she had used marijuana but answered \u201cNo\u201d to that question because she did not \nread the question thoroughly. She also attributed that response to using marijuana in a state where \nit was legal and not understanding it was illegal under Federal law. In completing a SCA in 2019, \nshe changed her answer to the question regarding illegal drug use. She also answered the SCA \nquestion that she intended to use marijuana in the future before talking to either the psychologist or \nthe attorney.  \nNoting that Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred in April 2018, the Judge concluded \nthat the Guideline H security concerns were not mitigated.  Regarding the falsification allegation, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe Judge concluded that the omission of her prior illegal drug usage in her first SCA was \nintentional. Applicant\u2019s explanations for that omission were not reasonable or credible and varied \neach time she responded. \u201cI did not find her claims of confusion to be plausible, given the plain \nlanguage of the question on the SCAs.\u201d Decision at 7.    \nDiscussion \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s findings about her drug \ninvolvement. Instead, she argues that she filled out her 2017 SCA to the best of her abilities, her \nomission in that document was a one-time mistake, and she \u201cdid not intentionally answer \u2018No\u2019\u201d to \nthe pertinent question. Appeal Brief at 3. We do not find her arguments persuasive. Her brief \nessentially repeats claims she made below that the Judge discounted.  The Directive requires us to \ngive deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determination. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. We find no reason to \ndisturb the Judge\u2019s unfavorable credibility determination in this case. From our review of the record, \nthe Judge\u2019s material findings and conclusions regarding the SCA falsification are based on \nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02345 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2021).  \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments amounts to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. For example, she argues that she did not have a good understanding of the defense \nindustry when filling out the SCA, she was not briefed on what was needed to complete a SCA, and \nshe received security training only after her security clearance was granted. None of Applicant\u2019s \narguments are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Id. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record.  Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(i) provides: \nIt must be noted that the adjudicative process is predicated upon individuals \nproviding relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use \nin investigating and adjudicating their national security eligibility.

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn May 20, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in the findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. For the \nreasons stated below, we affirm the Judge\u2019s decision. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling about $27,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, she admitted each of the allegations with explanations. In the analysis, the \nJudge concluded: \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are the result of her losing employment in 2014. \nHowever, she has been gainfully employed since June 2017. She did not take \nmeaningful steps to resolve the delinquent debts until 2021. She had some earlier \npayments plans in place, but they lapsed and she did not resume them. In recent \nmonths she has been proactive with the security clearance issue before her. This late \ncompliance, all of which post-dates the SF-86 and her interview does not constitute \ngood faith as contemplated by Appeal Board precedent. It does not mitigate the \nsecurityconcerns raised byher conduct. It appears the primarycatalyst to address her \ndelinquencies is the desire for a security clearance. She had the ability to pay her \ndebts but chose not to. Applicant\u2019s failure to act responsibly with regard to her \nfinancial obligations preclude finding that she has good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)\u00ad\n20(d) are not established. Applicant did not meet her burden to mitigate the financial \nconcerns set out in the SOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. through 1.g against \nApplicant.  [Decision at 5.] \nDiscussion \nIn her appeal brief, Applicant contends the Judge erred in making findings of fact about three \nof the alleged debts. We examine challenged findings to determine whether they are supported by \nsubstantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nFirst, Applicant asserts the Judge erred in finding the initial payment on an installment plan for a \n1   Applicant\u2019s last name in the caption differs from that in the SOR.  After issuance of the SOR, a court restored \nApplicant\u2019s last name to her maiden name.  See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit card debt of about $2,880 was due in March 2021. Applicant correctly points out the plan \nprovided the first payment was due a month earlier. See AE B. This error, however, was harmless \nbecause it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). Applicant also contends the Judge erred in finding \u201cno proof of [that] \npayment was provided.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. The Judge actually found that Applicant \u201cprovided no \npayment receipts\u201d for that debt, which is an accurate statement. To the extent that Applicant is \nclaiming the Judge erred by failing to give her credit for making that payment because her credit \nreport shows the balance of that debt was reduced by the amount of the first scheduled payment \nbetween February and March 2021 (AE E at 2-3), this purported error also did not likely affect the \noutcome of case. \nApplicant\u2019s challenges regarding the other two debts, in essence, are a disagreement with the \nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence rather than a dispute with specific factual findings. These \nchallenges involve a debt for $460 and another for $65.  Applicant is basically claiming she either \nresolved or disputed these debts and they were removed from her credit report. The Judge entered \nfindings that Applicant made such claims. To the extent that Applicant is contending the Judge erred \nin finding against her on those debts, we do not find that contention persuasive.  The Judge noted \nthat Applicant provided no documentation to substantiate her assertions that she either resolved or \ndisputed these debts. In this regard, the Appeal Board has previously stated that it is reasonable for \na Judge to expect an applicant to present documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve debts. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). Additionally, Mitigating \nCondition 20(e) requires an applicant to provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute[.]\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A\u00b6 20(e). It also merits noting there is more than one plausible \nexplanation for debts dropping off a credit report, such as the removal of debts due to the passage \nof time, and the absence of unsatisfied debts from an applicant\u2019s credit report does not extenuate \nor mitigate an overall history of financial difficulties or constitute evidence of financial reform or \nrehabilitation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments basically advocate for an alternative interpretation of the \nevidence and fail to demonstrate error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). None of her arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of \nthe evidence in the record or sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that \nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Id. Applicant\u2019s brief also notes the impact that an \nunfavorable decision will have on her. The Directive, however, does not permit us to consider such \nconsequences.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02020 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2020).  \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The \ndecision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only \nwhen \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). See also Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b): \u201cAny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d \n3 \n\n          \n             \nOrder \nThe Decision is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Michael Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Ra\u2019anan \nAdministrative Judge \nChairperson, Appeal Board \nSigned: James E.
