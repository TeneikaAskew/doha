Bakke, III, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \n \nOn July 26, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86). \nOn February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn February 27, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on June 5, \n2008, and issued a Notice of Hearing on June 5, 2008. The case was heard on June 25, \nAugust 11, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through C \ninto evidence without objection.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil July 11, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On \nthat day, Applicant submitted two exhibits that I marked as AE D and E and admitted \ninto the record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on July 3, 2008.                                                          \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all factual allegations contained in  \nthe SOR, and offered explanations for the denials.  \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. He is married, but currently separated. He has two \nchildren, ages, 22 and 19. The 22-year old is married and the 19-year old attends \ncollege.  He has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree.  From 1979 to 1997, he worked for a \nfederal contractor in computer engineering. He held a Secret security clearance during \nthose 17 years. (Tr. 66). \n \n \nApplicant left his position with the federal contractor in 1997 to start a software \ncompany with a couple other individuals. Initially, he took $60,000 out of his retirement \nfunds to pay personal and business expenses. Subsequently, the company obtained a \nline of credit on which to operate the business. While working in the business, the \nowners developed a product that they thought would be purchased by the government. \nIn order to pursue that contract, the company merged with a larger software company, a \nfederal contractor. However, the contract never materialized and the business failed in \n2001. When that happened, the business owed about $60,000 in business loans. The \npartners divided the debt, and Applicant took another $19,000 out of his retirement fund \nto retire his portion of the debt. (Tr. 60-61). Applicant continues to work for the \ncompany, as an employee, and applied for a security clearance in 2005. \n \n \nAs a result of the business venture, Applicant accumulated a substantial amount \nof personal debt from 1997 to 2001. (Tr. 45). Although he earned $55,000 to $60,000 \nper year from the new company, he was unable to manage his personal expenses and \npay the business expenses. (Tr. 47, 44). Based on credit bureau reports (CRB) from \nOctober 2005, November 2007, and January 2008, the SOR alleged 20 outstanding \ndelinquent debts, including one judgment, which accrued during that time period.1 (GE \n3, 4 & 5). The status of those debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \n1. Applicant paid two debts: \u00b6 1.b for $127 and \u00b6 1. h for $1,930. (AE C & E). \n \n2. Since June 2004, Applicant has attempted to resolve \u00b6 1.a, which is a $54,032 \njudgment entered against him by a credit card company. (The debts listed in \u00b6 1.c for \n                                            \n1The debts alleged in the SOR total about $225,000; however, some of the allegations are \nduplicate debts. More accurately, the debt amount is approximately $171,000, and possibly less.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n$49,043 and \u00b6 1.d for $4,980 total $54,032, and are duplicates of \u00b6 1.a.) Applicant\u2019s \nattorney had numerous conversations and correspondence with the creditor regarding \nthe matter, and ultimately settled it for $1,930. Applicant submitted a check for that \namount to the creditor, which was cashed. (Tr. 36; AE C).  Although Applicant\u2019s attorney \nrepeatedly sought an executed final Release of Judgment from the creditor, he has yet \nto receive one.  (AE C). \n \n \n3.  Fifteen debts listed on the SOR, totaling about $115,000, remain unpaid or \nunresolved.2 Several of them were charged off in 2000, some in 2001, and others in \n2002. They are no longer legally enforceable, as the statute of limitations expired on all \nof them. At the current time, Applicant does not intend to pay the debts. He was \npreviously advised by his attorney to pay his current bills, but not the delinquent credit \ncard debt. After giving Applicant that advice, his attorney notified Applicant\u2019s unsecured \ncreditors, viz., the credit card companies, that Applicant was financially unable to make \npayments. (Tr. 50; AE A). Applicant feels an obligation to pay the debts, which is a \nreason he did not file for bankruptcy. (Tr. 58). He would pay them if he won the \u201clottery.\u201d \n(Tr. 55).  \n \n \nApplicant began his current position in September 2001 and earns $115,000 \nannually. After paying expenses for two households and college costs, he has about \n$1,000 left a month for living expenses. He borrowed $12,000 from his mother and \nowes about $13,000 in credit card bills, some of which is attributable to his wife. \nPayments on all of his on-going obligations are current. (Tr. 54; AE A). Since the \nbusiness failure, he has paid off some debts not listed in the SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n                                            \n2Some of these debts may be duplicates, but it is unclear in the record.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns, two of \nwhich may be applicable in this case. Under AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201can inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. From 1997 to 2001, \nApplicant accumulated a significant amount of delinquent debt, a large portion of which \nremains unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise those two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the resulting \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n  \n Applicant started accumulating debt in 1997 and continued accumulating it into \n2002 (the date of several charged-off accounts). Given the amount of the delinquent \ndebt, which is owed to numerous creditors and accrued over a five-year period of time, \nthe debts were not infrequent and occurred in the recent past, such that AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose as a result of a business opportunity that failed \nto materialize. That situation was outside of his control. Applicant\u2019s attorney \nsubsequently notified his creditors of his financial problems, in order to resolve the \nsituation. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \nApplicant received financial advice on the management of his delinquent debts \nthrough his attorney, but he has not participated in a program specifically designed to \naddress budgeting, money management, credit card issues, and other financial \nconcerns, as generally contemplated under this condition. Currently, he is on a very \ntight budget and has accumulated $13,000 in credit card obligations over the past \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ncouple years. There is no evidence that fifteen of his previous debts are resolved, other \nthan a determination that they are legally unenforceable.  Hence, the evidence does not \ndemonstrate that he received credit counseling and/or that there is a clear indication \nthat his financial situation is under control, as required under AG \u00b6 20(c). This condition \ndoes not apply. \n \nApplicant\u2019s attorney repeatedly contacted a credit card company in order to \nresolve a large judgment. Applicant also paid two debts. Those actions demonstrate a \n\u201cgood faith\u201d effort to pay or resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b, 1.c., 1.d, and \n1.h, triggering the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). However, this condition does not apply to \nthe fifteen debts that remain unresolved or unpaid. \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant disputed any of the debts for which the \nstatute of limitations expired and remain unpaid. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable.  \nNor is there any evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(f).   \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 49-year-old man, who \nstarted a business that appeared to have great potential for success. While pursuing \nthat endeavor for five years, he supported it with personal funds and assumed a \nsignificant amount of personal debt. Unfortunately, in 2001, the business failed. He \nmanaged to pay off the business loan, pay some other debts, and stay current with on-\ngoing obligations. However, he could not pay about $171,000 of personal debt. In 2004, \nhis attorney began negotiating the settlement of a $54,000 judgment, which did not \nbegin to resolve until 2007. Although he has maintained a good paying position since \n2001, he has not taken any steps to resolve the remaining $117,000, owed to numerous \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ncredit card companies over the last seven to eight years. He honorably chose not to file \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy because he would like to resolve the debts in the future. \n \nApplicant initially defended his case on the theory that the statute of limitations \nexpired on most of the debts, and therefore, he was not legally responsible for the \ndebts. Although that defense is pertinent in civil matters, the Appeal Board has held that \neven though an applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were not legally collectible because of the \nstatute of limitations, that fact did not preclude the administrative judge from considering \nthe applicant\u2019s failure to resolve the delinquent debts before the statute of limitations \nran. ISCR Case No. 98-0349 at 2-1 (App. Bd. Feb. 3. 1999).  In this instance, Applicant \nhas not taken any steps to resolve the $117,000 of debt that was charged off in 2000. At \nthe time he completed his security clearance in 2005 and forthrightly disclosed the \nmultiple debts, he should have realized that the Government would have concerns \nabout those outstanding debts and his finances.  While those debts no longer pose a \npotential for coercion, his failure to seek resolution of the $117,000 for the past eight \nyears raises concerns about his reliability and judgment. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e through 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.t: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n March 26,2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge.

The Government presented eight \nexhibits, marked GE 1-8, which were admitted without objection.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 11, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in all the \nSOR allegations and provided explanations. He denied, however, the validity of the \ncharges reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e-1.h. Concerning the falsification \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, he admitted his failure to disclose the required \ninformation, but claimed his omissions were an innocent mistake and not with the intent \nto mislead or falsify his application.

After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old systems engineer. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy the \nday after he graduated from high school. He served aboard submarines as a sonar \ntechnician from 1968 to 1974. He achieved the rank of E-6 (Tr. 61).

From 1975 to \n1977, he completed a Bachelor of Science degree in Ocean Engineering (Tr. 61). In \n1977, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor, and he has been working basically \nthe same job (testing computer hardware and software), albeit for succeeding \ncompanies, ever since (Tr. 33).  \n \nApplicant had access to classified information while serving in the Navy. When \nhe was hired by the defense contractor in 1977, he received access to classified \ninformation at the secret level. He has maintained his access to classified information to \nthe present. There is no evidence Applicant has ever compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. He has never been cited or reprimanded because of \nsecurity issues, or for his failure to follow security rules and regulations (Tr. 61). \n \nApplicant has been married three times. He could not recall when he married or \ndivorced his first wife. He married his second wife in 2000, and divorced her in 2002. He \nmarried his third wife in 2004 (Tr. 34-35).  \n \nCriminal Conduct Allegations \n \n \nFrom 1985 to 2006, Applicant was implicated in eight incidents involving criminal \nactivity. In 1985, Applicant\u2019s then wife requested police to open an investigation \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s hiring a person to murder her. Applicant denied the allegation. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nHe satisfactorily explained a 16-year-old foster child he and his wife were caring for \nstarted the rumor. After the allegation was investigated by the police, there were no \ncharges filed against him, and the child was removed from the family\u2019s care (Tr. 40).  \n \nIn 1985, Applicant also was charged with two counts of assault and battery on his \nspouse. Applicant admitted he was charged as alleged, but explained these were \nheated verbal arguments which involved no physical contact. Both charges were \ndismissed after the prosecutors interviewed his then wife (Tr. 41-43). \n \nIn 1993, Applicant was convicted of assault and battery on his then girlfriend. He \nclaimed that during a verbal argument she threw hot coffee at him, and he pushed her. \nShe fell down against a kitchen cabinet and received a laceration to her head and broke \na leg. He was sentenced to serve 60 days in jail, which was suspended on the condition \nthat he attend an anger management training class (Tr. 43, GE 3).  \n \n \nIn September 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic assault \nand battery. The following month, Applicant was issued a protective order requiring him \nto refrain from family violence and requiring him to undergo a mental evaluation. The \ncharge was later dismissed, because it only involved a verbal altercation, and he \ncomplied with both protective order provisions (Tr. 45-46). \n \n \nAs a result of the court ordered mental evaluation, Applicant was diagnosed with \na bipolar personality disorder with mood swings and manic depression (Tr. 62). He was \nprescribed two medications which he has been diligently taking since September 1996. \nAdditionally, he sees a doctor every month to readjust his medications and to check for \npossible collateral adverse effects from the medications. Applicant repeatedly \nemphasized he takes the medications diligently and never skips them because the \nmedications make him feel good (Tr. 47-49, 58).  \n \n \nApplicant explained he and his second wife had frequent heated arguments \nbecause of infidelity and other marital problems which were exacerbated by his mental \ncondition. After he started his medications, his mood and demeanor changed and they \nstopped having so many arguments (Tr. 48). \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant shoplifted an $11 item from a retail store. He was involved in a \nverbal argument with the store\u2019s detective and was also charged with breach of peace. \nHe was convicted and sentenced to three months in jail (suspended), placed on 18 \nmonths probation, and released on his own recognizance (Tr. 49-51). Applicant was \nfrank, candid, and forthcoming in his explanations of this incident.  \n \n \nIn February 2004 and January 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nassault and battery on his brother-in-law. Both charges were latter Nolle Processed. In \nhis response to the SOR, Applicant claimed his brother-in-law was upset at him and \nfiled the allegations to get even. At his hearing, Applicant explained his brother-in-law is \nan alcoholic who lives with Applicant and his wife sporadically. His wife is trying to save \nher brother from his alcohol addiction (Tr. 64). Applicant claimed in 2004 and 2006, his \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbrother-in-law was drunk, rude, and verbally abusive towards Applicant\u2019s wife. On both \noccasions, Applicant and his brother-in-law were involved in verbal arguments which \nescalated into a shoving and pushing match. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law filed charges \nagainst Applicant, failed to appear at the court proceedings, and the charges were \ndismissed (Tr. 51-54). \n \n \nSince January 2006, Applicant has been involved in one more incident with his \nbrother-in-law. In late 2007 or early 2008, Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was again drunk \nand abusive towards Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant claimed he has learned his lesson and \nhe no longer resorts to pushing and shoving his brother-in-law (Tr. 56). He was able to \ncontrol his brother-in-law by talking and reasoning with him. As a result of this last \nincident, Applicant received a subpoena to testify in court (AE 1). Since the January \n2006 incident, Applicant has not been arrested, charged, or involved in any other police \nrelated incidents (Tr. 54, 59).  \n \n \nApplicant has not consumed alcoholic beverages since he left the Navy. He is \ndiabetic and requires shots to control the disease. His left hip was replaced and walks \nwith a cane because he has a bad right hip (Tr. 57).  \n \nFalsification Allegations \n \nSOR \u00b6 2a and \u00b6 2b alleged Applicant falsified his answers to question 23(f) of his \nMay 2007 security clearance application. Question 23(f) asked whether in the last seven \nyears he had been arrested, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not previously \ndisclosed elsewhere in his application. Applicant failed to disclose that in January 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 2(a)) and in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2(b)) he was arrested and charged with \nassault on his brother-in-law.  \n \nApplicant admitted his failure to disclose the required information. He \nsatisfactorily explained his omissions were a mistake and not made with the intent to \nmislead the government or to falsify his application. He averred he misread the security \nclearance application. He believed that since the charges were dropped (Nolle \nProcessed) he did not have to disclose them in response to question 23(f). He admitted \nhe did not pay sufficient attention to his application when he was completing it due to \ninterruptions at work (Tr. 36). However, Applicant took responsibility for his lack of \ndiligence. He testified nobody rushed him to complete the application, that he rushed \nhimself. He acknowledged that if he had questions about the application he should have \nasked for assistance, but he failed to do so (Tr. 38). \n \nApplicant\u2019s prior security clearance application was submitted in October 1996. \nAt that time, he properly disclosed in response to question 23(f) his 1993 arrest and \nconviction for domestic assault and battery. Moreover, in his response to question 23(c) \n(asking whether he had any charges pending against him for any criminal offenses), \nApplicant answer \u201cYes,\u201d and disclosed his September 1996 arrest for assault and \nbattery on his wife. He further disclosed his scheduled court date for December 1996, \nand the jurisdiction where the charges were pending (GE 1). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nHaving observed closely Applicant\u2019s demeanor, I find his testimony credible. I \nfind his omissions were not made with the intent to mislead the government or to falsify \nhis application. At his hearing, Applicant promptly answered all the questions asked. He \nwas frank, candid, and forthcoming in his answers and explained his answers without \nhesitation. He readily admitted his bad behavior and apologized numerous times for his \nquestionable behavior. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his actions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nFrom 1985 to 2006, Applicant was involved in six criminal conduct related \nincidents. He was convicted of domestic assault and battery in 1993, and shoplifting in \n2001. Four of the remaining incidents involved charges for assault and battery on family \nmembers that were dismissed or not prosecuted.4 Taken together, these incidents \ncreate doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment, and his ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. Criminal Conduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca \nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted,\u201d apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal related incident occurred in January 2006. The 2007-\n2008 incident with his brother-in-law (disclosed at the hearing) did not involve \nquestionable behavior and raised no further security concerns. Because of his history or \nepisodic criminal behavior over an extended period of time, the passage of time \nmitigates his behavior but only to a certain extent. AG \u00b6 32(a). \n \n \nMost of Applicant\u2019s aberrational behavior was evidently caused by his bipolar \npersonality disorder. Although he has been diligently taking medication since 1996, it is \npossible that fluctuation in his mental condition related to his medicine could have \n \n4  I considered SOR \u00b6 1d (the October 1996 protective order allegation) part and parcel of SOR \u00b6 \n1e (the September 1996 assault and battery charge). Concerning SOR \u00b6 1h, I find Applicant satisfactorily \nexplained it was investigated and dismissed by the police as a false allegation. \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontributed to his questionable behavior. Applicant visits his doctor monthly to insure \nthe proper balance of his medications. Since January 2006, Applicant has been able to \ncontrol his impulses. For example, the 2007-2008 incident with his brother-in-law was \nresolved peacefully by Applicant, and he was not subsequently arrested or charged.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified he has learned his lesson and no longer will rely on \nviolence to resolve problems with his brother-in-law. He also expressed sincere remorse \nfor his questionable behavior. Applicant other afflictions, i.e., his diabetes and bad hip, \nwill make it unlikely he will be able to rely on violence to resolve his disputes. Moreover, \nbecause of the DOHA hearing process, Applicant has come to realize for the first time \nthe adverse impact his questionable behavior could have on his ability to have access \nto classified information, and to retain his employment. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(c) \n\u201cthere is successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse . . .,\u201d applies. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that \u201cconduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d AG \u00b6 15.  \n \nThe government\u2019s evidence established Applicant failed to disclose relevant \ninformation in his answer to question 23(f) of his security clearance application. \nNotwithstanding, I find Applicant\u2019s omissions were not deliberate or with the intent to \nmislead or falsify his application. Considering the record as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s \nomissions were caused by his lack of diligence. He failed to carefully read and pay \nattention to the questions asked of him in his security clearance application. My findings \nare corroborated by his candid disclosure of adverse information in his 1996 security \nclearance application and his hearing testimony. Having observed Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor, and weighing his testimony in light of all available evidence, I find him to be \ncredible. His testimony refutes the allegation of deliberate falsification. Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony was frank, candid, and forthright. I also believe Applicant expressed sincere \nremorse for his omissions. Based on Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I believe he \nhas learned his lesson from his past mistakes, and similar questionable behavior is \nunlikely. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n8 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nFrom 1985 to 2006, Applicant was involved in six criminal conduct related \nincidents. He was convicted of domestic assault and battery in 1993, and shoplifting in \n2001. Four of the remaining incidents involved charges for assault and battery on family \nmembers that were dismissed or not prosecuted. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and educated \nman. He served honorably in the Navy for approximately seven years. He has worked \nfor the same defense contractor (albeit the contractor has changed names) and has had \naccess to classified information at the secret level for approximately 31 years. He has \nreceived treatment for bipolar disease, and has responded to that treatment. He \nscrupulously takes his medications and meets with his doctor once a month to check \nthe effectiveness of his medication. His current marriage and resolution of conflict show \neffective relationships and anger management. Except for the pending allegations, there \nis no evidence of Applicant\u2019s questionable behavior or, more importantly that he has \never compromised or caused others to compromise classified information.  \n \nConsidering his demeanor and testimony, I believe Applicant has learned from \nhis mistakes, and his questionable behavior is unlikely to recur. He is now a more \nmature and savvy person as a result of his brushes with the law and the security \nclearance process. There is no credible evidence Applicant has been involved in \nadditional misconduct or questionable behavior since January 2006. In sum, I find \nApplicant has presented sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence convinces me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from his criminal conduct and personal conduct security \nconcerns.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 18, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on March 3, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 14, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on April 8, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one \nApril 22, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nwitness, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were received without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 17, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to India. Applicant did not object. The request and the attached \ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, \nbelow.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He was born in \nIndia. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Indian university. He came to the United \nStates in 1980 to attend graduate school and obtained a master\u2019s degree from an \nAmerican university. He remained in the U.S. and obtained employment. He has spent \nmost of his career since 1984 working for defense contractors in the aerospace \nindustry. Applicant was married in 1983. His wife was also born in India. He and his wife \nbecame U.S. citizens in 2000. They have a 15-year-old child who was born in the U.S.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and sister are citizens and residents of India. His mother is 73 \nyears old. She has never worked outside the home. His father has been deceased for \nabout ten years. He worked for many years for a local government agency until he \nretired more than 25 years ago. His sister is a college professor and lecturer. Her \nhusband is an engineer in the private sector. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are \nalso citizens and residents of India.2 \n \n \nApplicant considers himself a good son and son-in-law. He and his wife traveled \nto India in 2000, 2001, and 2005 to visit their family. His mother has twice visited \nApplicant in the United States. Applicant talks to his mother about once or twice a \nmonth. When his sister and her husband were living with his mother, he would speak to \nthem on occasion when he called his mother. He does not regularly speak to them now \nthat they are not living with his mother. His sister has never visited him in the U.S. His \nmother owns two homes in India, which he estimates have a value of about $76,000. He \nhas no foreign assets. Applicant estimates the value of his assets in the U.S. at about \n$1,000,000.3  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26-28, 48; GE 1, 2; AE D. \n \n2 Tr. at 24, 29, 32-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE D. \n \n3 Tr. at 24, 36-43, 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nA witness on Applicant\u2019s behalf testified that he is an exemplary person, very \nethical, and a loyal U.S. citizen. Character letters state that he is an excellent employee, \nhighly ethical, and loyal. His performance appraisals have been superior.4 \n \nIndia \n \n \nAccording to its constitution, India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic \nrepublic. It is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament \nand a population of approximately 1.1 billion.  \n \nThe Indian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but numerous \nserious problems remain. Police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial \nkillings of persons in custody, disappearances, torture, and rape. The lack of \naccountability permeated the government and security forces, creating an atmosphere \nin which human rights violations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks have \nbeen committed in recent years by separatist and terrorist groups. \n \nThe U.S. recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to \nstrengthen its relationship with India. The two countries are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies, both committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment, and share common interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting \nterrorism, and in creating a strategically stable Asia. However, differences over India\u2019s \nnuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform exist. There are also concerns \nabout India\u2019s relations with Iran, including their increasing cooperation with the Iranian \nmilitary. \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India, including technology and equipment which \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign \ngovernment entities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have \ncapitalized on private-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive \nU.S. technology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments \nor its use in military applications. \n \nThe U.S. views India as a growing world power with which it shares common \nstrategic interests. There is a strong partnership between the two countries and they are \nexpected to continue to address differences and shape a dynamic and collaborative \nfuture. The U.S. and India are seeking to elevate the strategic partnership further to \ninclude cooperation in counter-terrorism, defense cooperation, education, and joint \ndemocracy promotion. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 52-57; AE A-C, E, F. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \n\n \n5 \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, brother-in-law, and parents-in-laws are citizens and \nresidents of India. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works closely with the U.S. on \nmany matters, shares common strategic interests, and generally respects the rights of \nits citizens. But it also continues to have some human rights issues, has been victimized \nby terrorist attacks, and restricted, dual use technology has been illegally exported to \nIndia. This creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and \n(d) have been raised by the evidence. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant came to the U.S. as a young man to further his education. He \nremained, obtained a successful career as an engineer, married, had a child, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen. While he and his wife still have family in India, their life and \nfuture are here. India is a democracy and strategic partner of the U.S. Technology has \nbeen illegally exported to India, but the Hearing Exhibits provided by Counsel do not \nshow that coercion was utilized. I find that it is not likely Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of the Indian government or his \nfamily members in India and the interests of the United States. I further find there is \nminimal conflict of interest, because Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are partially applicable. No \nother mitigating condition is applicable. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in India. He \ncame to the U.S. in 1980 to further his education. He remained in the U.S., thrived and \nbecame an established, highly regarded engineer, with considerable U.S. ties and \nassets. He and his wife became U.S. citizens in 2000. They have a 15-year-old child \nwho was born in the U.S. His life, immediate family, professional career, financial \nassets, and future are now here.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to India. There is a strong \npartnership between the U.S. and India and they share common strategic interests. \nHowever, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d5 The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly \ngovernments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, \nsometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged \nin espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with \nthe U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. Also very \nimportant is whether the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \n \nIndia is a democracy that generally respects the rights of its citizens, but \nnumerous serious problems remain. Like almost every country, including the United \nStates, it has been victimized by terrorist acts. Restricted, dual use technology has been \nillegally exported to India, but there is no indication that India utilizes coercion against its \ncitizens for espionage purposes. Many of our allies conduct intelligence gathering \nagainst the U.S. India would be jeopardizing its relationship with the U.S. by raising the \nstakes, and attempting to use duress against one of its citizens in an attempt to coerce \na U.S. citizen to commit espionage. Applicant\u2019s position, assets, and ties in the U.S. \nmake economic coercion through his mother, sister, brother-in-law, or parents-in-law \nthrough his wife, extremely unlikely to happen. In the very unlikely event that a conflict \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n8 \n \narose, I am convinced that because of Applicant\u2019s strong ties to the United States, that \nhe would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 9, 2008, and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe government\u2019s written case on July 23, 2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file \nDecember 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant received the FORM on August 21, 2008. As of October 21, 2008, he had not \nresponded. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 21, \n2008, and reassigned to me on December 15, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nThe Government offered Exhibit (GE) 11, which purports to be a certified result of \ninterview. It includes a signed affidavit from Applicant dated February 15, 2008, stating \n\u201cthat the information [he] provided to an investigator in May 21, 2007 is true and \ncorrect.\u201d Attached are Office of Personnel Management (OPM) reports of investigation \n(ROI). An ROI stated that a personal subject interview (PSI) was conducted on \nFebruary 15, 2008, to obtain a signed affidavit. The PSI of May 21, 2007 was not \nincluded in GE 11. There were additional ROIs about information apparently obtained \nby the OPM investigator. The only item that Applicant certified as true was the \ninformation provided to the OPM investigator on May 21, 2007, and that information was \nnot included in GE 11. The other information in GE 11 is inadmissible without an \nauthenticating witness under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Additional Procedural Guidance. Since \nthere is nothing admissible contained in GE 11, it will not be admitted or considered.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since September 2006. He is a high school graduate. He was \nmarried in 1991 and divorced in 1993. He has two children, ages 16 and 12.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in August 1990, and charged with possession of stolen \nproperty. He pled guilty and was sentenced to a fine, 30 days confinement, with 4 days \nconverted to community service, and 12 months probation. Applicant indicated that he \nwas in a friend\u2019s car, which had a stolen stereo installed in it, when the car was stopped \nby the police.2   \n \n \nApplicant was cited in January 1994 for public nuisance. He and a friend were \nplaying loud music on a portable stereo at about 4:30 am in the parking lot next to a \nhigh school football field. He and the friend were exercising on the field and did not \nrealize the music would carry as far as it did. He was found guilty of the infraction, fined, \nand given a 10-day suspended sentence.3   \n \n \nApplicant let two girls drive his car in September 2001. The car was involved in \nan accident when they hit a mail box and the car ended up in a ditch. The girls left the \nscene of the accident. Applicant came back and removed the car from the ditch and left. \n                                                          \n1 GE 9. \n \n2 GE 3, 4, 10. \n \n3 GE 3, 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nWhen he was contacted by the police he provided them false information and stated \nthat he was the driver of the vehicle. He was arrested and charged with obstruction of \nlaw enforcement. He was convicted, fined, and sentenced to 365 days in jail, with 364 \ndays suspended.4   \n \n \nAn Order for Protection was issued against Applicant on June 30, 2003, ordering \nhim to have no contact with an ex-girlfriend except by U.S. mail, and to remain 500 feet \nfrom her residence and place of employment. He was investigated in August 2003, for \nviolating the Order of Protection. He admitted to the police officer that he left a vulgar \nnote on her windshield and that he went to see her at her new boyfriend\u2019s house. He \nwas charged on September 3, 2003, with criminal trespass which occurred in May 2003, \nprior to the issuance of the Order of Protection. Prosecution was deferred for two years \npending payment of a fine and completion of a mental health evaluation and an alcohol \nevaluation. Applicant completed the terms of the deferred adjudication and the charge \nwas dismissed in December 2005.5  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in June 2006, and charged with rape of a child, third \ndegree. He pled guilty in August 2006, to communicating with a child for immoral \npurposes. He was sentenced to a fine, 365 days confinement with 363 days suspended \nfor two years, two years probation, and he was ordered to register as a sexual offender. \nApplicant indicated that a neighbor wanted to drive his car. She told him that her friend \nwanted to have sex with him. He let the neighbor drive the car. He stated that he \nthought the age of consent was 16, and both girls told him that the friend was 16 years \nold. He also stated that \u201cthe girl lied about her age.\u201d The age of the girl is not in \nevidence, but she must have been under 16 years old.6   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \n                                                          \n4 GE 3, 6. \n \n5 GE 3, 7, 8. \n \n6 GE 3, 4, 9, 10. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrests and convictions raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c) as disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a)-(d) are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent conviction is the most serious. He was on probation for \ntwo years, which at best, just ended a few months ago. He is a registered sexual \noffender. Applicant did not submit sufficient evidence to raise any mitigating condition. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n\n \n6 \n \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nAn Order for Protection was issued against Applicant, ordering him to have no \ncontact with an ex-girlfriend. I do not find that the issuance of the Order of Protection \nindependently raises any disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 2.a is found for Applicant. \nThere is evidence that Applicant on at least two occasions violated the Order of \nProtection. Those illegal actions are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(c) and (e) as \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant violated the Order of Protection in 2003. He was convicted in 2006, of \ncommunicating with a child for immoral purposes. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a lengthy history of \ncriminal acts. He is a registered sexual offender arising from a 2006 conviction. His \nexplanation for the 2006 act is that he mistakenly thought the girl was 16 years old.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

On December 17, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 3, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard\ndenied  Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether he was denied certain procedural\nrights and information prior to and during the hearing; (b) whether the Judge failed to consider\nrecord evidence;  and (c) whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFor the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nApplicant makes numerous references in his appeal brief to alleged facts (some of which\nconcern alleged historical events that post-date the hearing) that are not part of the record below.\nThe Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant contends that he was untrained and was an unknowledgeable person in legal\nmatters and yet was required to represent himself, even though he could not do so effectively.\nApplicant states that he was unable to afford an attorney, and speculates that, if he had the right to\nfree legal representation by the federal or state governments, he was not informed of any such rights.\nHe also claims that he asked for instructions, information or other advice about preparing for the\nclearance hearing, but that nothing was provided to him by his superiors.  Applicant asserts that this\nfailure to provide requested materials meant that he had no legal guidance concerning what the\nhearing was all about.  Additionally, Applicant claims he was not informed that he could bring\ncharacter witnesses to the hearing, and was unaware that he could discuss such matters as his military\nand job performance.\n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts on appeal concerning pre-hearing and hearing procedure are hindered\nsignificantly by the fact that he made no mention of these alleged irregularities before or during the\nhearing below.  Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected\nto take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their\nrights, that failure to act does not  constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n19896 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).  Given the legal maxim that there is no presumption of error below,\nApplicant\u2019s failure to address these matters at the hearing level makes his burden on appeal a\nparticularly challenging one.    \n1\nApplicants have the right to retain counsel to represent them in these proceedings, Executive\nOrder 10865, Section 3(5); Directive, \u00b6 4.3.4 and Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00b6 E3.1.8.  Absent\na constitutional right to counsel, Applicant was not entitled to have the government pay for an\n\nSee, e.g., Lavado v. Keohana, 992 F.2d 601, 605-06 (6  Cir. 1993); United States v. Gosnell, 961 F.2d 1518,\n2\nth\n1521 (10  Cir. 1992). \nth\n3\nattorney to represent him.  There is no constitutional right to counsel in civil proceedings,  and\n2\nDOHA proceedings are civil in nature.  Therefore, in these proceedings an applicant is not entitled\nto have an attorney appointed to represent the applicant or be reimbursed by the government if the\napplicant retains an attorney.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).  A\nreview of the hearing transcript demonstrates that the Judge took great pains to describe Applicant\u2019s\nadministrative rights, especially with regard to his right to representation.  Applicant\u2019s claims are\nsignificantly undermined by the extensive discussion on the record of his rights and his failure to\nraise any claims or concerns at the hearing.      \nApplicant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel argument also lacks merit.  The ineffective\nassistance of counsel doctrine does not apply to civil proceedings.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0127\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 1997)(citing federal cases).  Thus, the ineffective assistance of counsel\ndoctrine does not apply to DOHA proceedings.  Having decided to represent himself, Applicant\ncannot now complain about the quality of his self-representation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0752\nat 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1998).  \nAlthough he specifically talks about only his superiors\u2019 failure to provide him with\ninstructions and information about the hearing, Applicant also states generally that he had no legal\nguidance concerning what the hearing was all about.  The Board will construe Applicant\u2019s argument\nas stating that DOHA failed to provide Applicant with a copy of the Directive and the written\ninstructions that are routinely provided applicants in DOHA proceedings.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption of regularity in administrative proceedings, and Applicant\nhas proffered no evidence that would justify a conclusion by the Board that Applicant did not receive\nwritten pre-hearing instructions.  Moreover, at the outset of the hearing, the Judge  specifically asked\nApplicant if he felt he was prepared to proceed with the hearing.  Applicant responded unequivocally\nin the affirmative during questioning of him by the Judge, a course of dialogue clearly intended to\nillicit feelings of confusion and/or unease on the part of the Applicant.  Thus, the record seriously\nundercuts any argument on appeal that Applicant, at the critical time, considered himself unprepared\nfor the hearing, whether through any omissions by DOHA or otherwise.  Similarly, Applicant\u2019s\nassertions about his lack of knowledge concerning the use of character witnesses and the production\nof other favorable evidence are without merit.  The onus was on Applicant to make inquiries and to\nclear up any doubts he had about these matters prior to and during the hearing.\nApplicant argues that numerous facts in evidence were not considered by the Judge.  There\nis a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence presented unless the Judge\nspecifically states to the contrary.  After a review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision, the Board\nconcludes that Applicant has failed to carry the burden of overcoming the presumption.  In fact,\nseveral of the evidentiary matters Applicant claims the Judge ignored are specifically mentioned in\nthe Judge\u2019s decision.\n\nAs indicated in an earlier paragraph, Applicant makes a number of assertions of fact that were not part of the\n3\nrecord below, and most of these involve his more recent actions regarding his finances.  The Board will not consider\nthese.  \n4\nImplicit in Applicant\u2019s appeal is the assertion that the Judge did not give proper weight to\nmatters presented by Applicant in mitigation, and his decision is therefore arbitrary, capricious and\ncontrary to law.  In his brief, Applicant summarizes the favorable evidence he presented below and\ndescribes his ongoing efforts to resolve his financial problems.   Applicant\u2019s arguments do not\n3\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred.  \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  After a review of the entirety of the record, the Board concludes that the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\n   \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December 17, 2007. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems. For the reasons discussed below, this case is decided against\nApplicant. \nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nJuly 3, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received on January 10, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2008. The hearing\ntook place as scheduled on May 16, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 2,\n2008.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 27 delinquent debts (\u00b6 1.a\u2013\u00b6 1.l) ranging\nfrom $74 to $12,151 for about $66,000 in total. The delinquent debts include collection\naccounts and charged-off accounts. He admitted 21 of 27 debts. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked as a\nnetwork engineer for his current employer since about January 2005. He held a security\nclearance when he was on active military duty, and he now is seeking to obtain an\nindustrial security clearance for the first time. To that end, he completed a security-\nclearance application in December 2005 (Exhibit 1). In response to questions about his\nfinancial record, he disclosed a repossession, an unpaid judgment, and numerous\ndelinquent accounts. \nHis annual salary is about $49,000. He has married and divorced twice. His most\nrecent marriage took place in 1993 and ended in divorce in about August 2001.\nApplicant attributes some of his financial problems to this divorce, as he agreed to take\non the marital debts. \nIn 1987, Applicant enlisted in the Army after completing his high-school\neducation. He intended to serve to obtain educational benefits, but he enjoyed it and\ndecided to make it a career. He worked as an automated logistical specialist. He served\n12 years and 11 months before he retired in June 2000 due to disability. \nHis disability arose from a traffic accident in July 1998 that resulted in a head\ninjury. Initially, he was in a coma and was thereafter hospitalized for several months.\nIndeed, from July 1998 to his retirement in June 2000, he was either hospitalized or\nconvalescing at home, all the while receiving full pay and benefits at his paygrade of E-\n6. His disability was initially categorized as temporary, but he was not allowed to return\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain\nth\nthat there is no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases\nsuch as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n3\nto active duty. He suffers from a lack of balance or stability (\u201cBut if I stand up and you\nwere to push me, I\u2019ll fall down\u201d) (Tr. 55). \nThe VA has rated Applicant 60% disabled and he now receives $324 monthly. In\naddition, he received a lump-sum payment of about $45,000 in about January 2003 (Tr.\n58). He was able to account for that money in only very general terms (Tr. 58\u201360).\nApplicant experienced underemployment and unemployment after his disability\nretirement. He worked several different jobs without satisfaction and had a six-month\nperiod of unemployment in 2002. In September 2002, he returned to school (he had\npreviously earned an associate\u2019s degree) at a state university. He earned a B.B.A. in\ninformation systems in December 2004, and he started his current job the following\nmonth. He loves his current job and desires to continue working there for the\nforeseeable future. \nApplicant\u2019s two minor daughters have lived with him from time-to-time during the\nlast few years (Tr. 48\u201352). This circumstance resulted in additional living expenses.\nCurrently, his youngest daughter is living with him. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is well documented (Exhibits 1\u20136). The\ndelinquent debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the admitted\ndocumentary evidence. He has not paid in full, settled, or resolved any of the debts in\nthe SOR. He established a debt snowball payoff plan for 26 accounts (Exhibit 2). But he\nhas been unable to take action via the plan due to his regular monthly expenses (Tr. 54,\n60). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\nlevel and retention of any existing security clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order\n6\n10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n16\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more\n17\nthan sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\n\n6\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and,\nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\n \nThe most pertinent is MC 2; the others do not apply based on the facts and\ncircumstances of this case. \nMC 2\u2014conditions largely beyond a person's control\u2014applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nIt \nappears \nApplicant \nwas \na \nfinancially \nresponsible \nperson \nserving \nas \na\nnoncommissioned officer in the Army in 1998 when he was in a traffic accident resulting\nin a serious head injury. As a result, he was unable to continue with his military career,\nwhich ended with a disability retirement in 2000. A divorce from his second wife followed\nshortly thereafter in 2001. His post-Army employment history also contributed to his\nfinancial problems, as he experienced both underemployment and unemployment.\nTaken together, these circumstances were largely beyond his control. He has acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances by seeking work and additional education. His\ndecision to further his education was wise, but it limited his ability to address his\nindebtedness. Nevertheless, returning to school to improve one\u2019s job skills and\nemployability is rarely an irresponsible decision. \nAnother potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to initiate\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. He has taken a\nfew positive steps to resolve his financial problems as evidenced by establishing the\nsnowball debt repayment plan. But his efforts, in light of the extent of ongoing financial\nproblems, are not enough to qualify as a good-faith effort. Indeed, Applicant\nacknowledged that he has been unable to act upon his plan, which suggests that it is\nnot a realistic and workable plan. \nThis case presents both unfavorable and favorable evidence, which requires\nthoughtful balancing in light of the clearly-consistent standard. I have considered the\ntotality of facts and circumstances and conclude the favorable evidence is not\npersuasive. Applicant is facing a mountain of delinquent debt and he has not made any\nmeasurable improvement to his situation. Although he has experienced difficult\ncircumstances, starting with the traffic accident in 1998, some forward progress on\nresolving his indebtedness is necessary to obtain a favorable decision. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of\npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.aa:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIn April 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a determination be \nmade in his case without a hearing.  On May 20, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a \nFile Of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM was mailed to Applicant on May 21, \n2008. Applicant received the FORM on June 20, 2008. He had thirty days from the \nreceipt of the FORM to submit additional matters. He did not submit additional matters. \nOn August 15, 2008, the case was forwarded to the hearing office and assigned to me. \nSeptember 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to update his security clearance.  He is an electronic assembler specialist and \nhas worked for his current employer since October 2002. He holds a secret security \nclearance. He is divorced and has two adult children, a son, age 30, and a daughter, \nage 28. (Item 5.)   \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents. He was arrested on three \noccasions for Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) in 1969, March 2003, and September \n2006. (Item 5, question 23(d); Item 10, question 24.) He began to drink alcohol at age \n15. In 1974, he was intoxicated and walking home. He lived near some train tracks and \nfell asleep next to the tracks. He was run over by a train and lost both of his legs. After \nthe accident, he stopped drinking for awhile but became addicted to pain medication. \n(Item 8 at 4.) \n \nOn March 2, 2003, Applicant was out with his friends drinking and later drove \nhome while intoxicated. He does not recall driving home but he pulled his car up to the \nside of the road next to the driveway entrance of his home and fell asleep in his car. The \nlights were on and the car was running. Early in the morning, he was awakened by \npolice officers. He was arrested and charged with DWI. He pled to a reduced charge of \n\u201creckless driving.\u201d He lost his driver\u2019s license for 90 days, paid a $300 fine, and received \nthree years probation. (Item 8 at 3.) \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant was at a bar with his friends and drank to \nintoxication. He drove in the direction of his home and fell asleep at the wheel. He did \nnot remember driving home. The police discovered him in his car asleep. His car was in \nthe middle of the road and the engine was running. His breathalyzer registered .15, \nwhich is over the legal limit. He was arrested and charged with DWI. He pled guilty to \nDWI First Offense and was issued a $900 fine, a one year license revocation, 3-5 years \nprobation, and was ordered to attend alcohol classes.  He attended three eight hour \nclasses, and it was recommended he seek further alcohol treatment. He started to \nattend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in June 2007. (Item 8 at 3-4; Item 9.) It is not \nclear whether Applicant continues to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.    \n \nApplicant refers to himself as a \u201cfunctional alcoholic.\u201d He admits to being a heavy \ndrinker since his divorce in 1991. His drinking was a cause of the divorce. He reduced \nhis drinking after his 2006 DWI. He recognizes that he has a problem with alcohol. It \ntakes him 10-12 beers to become drunk. He sometimes misses work due to his alcohol \nuse. (Item 8 at 4.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn his answer to interrogatories, dated December 18, 2007, Applicant stated that \nhe occasionally drinks beer or wine on a special occasion. He estimated his alcohol use \nwas monthly. He no longer drinks to intoxication. The last time he was intoxicated was \nhis September 2006 arrest.  He indicated that the last time he drank alcohol was when \nhe drank \u201csome wine and few beers with [his] family.\u201d (Item 7 at 1.) He did not provide \ninformation on his current drinking habits when he answered the SOR. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG & 21:       \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \napply: \n \nAC DC &22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent) applies. Since 1969, Applicant has had three alcohol-\nrelated arrests. His last two arrests were in 2003 and 2006.  These arrests raise cause \nfor concern due to Applicant falling asleep in his car while the car was still running. He \nalso was not aware how he drove home on each occasion.  \n \nAC DC &22(b) (alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) does not \napply.  There is no information in the record applicable to this disqualifying condition. \nApplicant admits to occasionally calling in sick due to his alcohol consumption but this \ncannot be considered an alcohol-related incident at work.  \n \nAC DC &22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the person is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or \nalcohol dependent) applies. Applicant has a history of drinking alcohol to point of \nimpaired judgment.  He admits that he is a heavy drinker. His excessive consumption of \nalcohol resulted in the loss of his legs in an unfortunate accident in 1974 and three \nserious alcohol-related incidents (i.e. DWIs).   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. Although \nApplicant claims that he has reduced his drinking since his 2006 DWI, he still continues \nto drink.  \n \n \nAC MC & 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser) does not apply.  Applicant describes himself as a functional alcoholic. \nAfter his 2006 DWI, he started to attend alcoholics anonymous meetings. However, he \ncontinues to occasionally drink alcohol. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to provide evidence of \nactions that he has taken to overcome his alcohol problem. There is minimal evidence \nin the record pertaining to his efforts to overcome his alcohol problem. Considering that \nhe still occasionally drinks alcohol, a pattern of abstinence has not been established.    \nApplicant has not met his burden to apply this mitigating condition.  \n \nAC MC \u00b623(c) (the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or a treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress) is not applicable. Aside from court-ordered classes \nand Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, Applicant has never participated in an alcohol  \ntreatment program. FC MC &23(d) (the individual has successfully completed inpatient \nor outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of \nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program) does not apply for the same \nreason. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide information \npertaining to his work performance or other whole person factors. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and his three DWIs. While Applicant attended \nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings after his 2006 DWI, he still drinks alcohol occasionally. \nApplicant has the burden to mitigate the concerns under Guideline G, Alcohol \nConsumption. He has not met that burden. Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, is found \nagainst Applicant.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 6, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive).  Applicant Counsel requested a hearing.  On February 27, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s finding that\nApplicant did not falsify his time sheets is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the record evidence;\nwhether the Judge\u2019s application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 17(c), (d), and (e) is\nunsupported by the record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s application of those mitigating\nconditions and her whole-person analysis are unsustainable because they fail to consider a significant\naspect of the case.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent factual findings: Applicant served on active duty in\nthe U.S. Navy for over six years and then served in the reserves for over twenty years.  After\nApplicant left active duty, he began working for the Navy as a civilian employee and later for a\nDefense contractor.  Applicant was working on several projects at a time, including some of a highly\nsecret nature.  It was Applicant\u2019s understanding that he could not reveal to his supervisors the work\nhe did on those projects or the amount of time he spent away from the office due to his work on\nthem.  Investigations were conducted on the accuracy of Applicant\u2019s time and attendance records and\nhis use of his government credit card.  The investigations revealed discrepancies on Applicant\u2019s time\nsheets.  At the time in question, Applicant completed his time sheet at the end of the week and did\nnot keep daily records of his time spent in his office or away working on other projects.  Applicant\nacknowledged that he did not maintain accurate records and may have included time spent at the gym\nas work time.  Investigations also revealed that Applicant had used his government credit card for\npersonal expenses and for military reserve travel, although he only claimed reimbursement for the\nitems properly charged on the card.  In March 2003, after the investigations, Applicant\u2019s agency\nissued a notice of his proposed removal.  Instead, Applicant reached an agreement with the\ngovernment under which he agreed to reimburse the government in the amount of $3,827.70 for the\nexcess work time he had claimed, and was allowed to resign.  Applicant later began working for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor.  Applicant submitted 14 letters of recommendation attesting to\nhis work skills and ethics.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\n\n3\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s appeal concerns the conclusions the Judge drew from the factual\nfindings.  In arguing the issues on appeal, Department Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision\ndoes not take into account significant contrary record evidence.  The Board will address that\ncontention below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\n\nGovernment Exhibit 15 has a document in which Applicant\u2019s supervisor determined that 96 of the 137\n1\npurchases on Applicant\u2019s government credit card were for unauthorized personal expenses when Applicant was not on\nofficial government travel.\n4\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant had not falsified his time\nsheets was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument has merit.  There is substantial record evidence of the following:\nApplicant was required to submit time sheets showing how many hours he\nworked each workday.  Investigations into Applicant\u2019s time sheets revealed\ndiscrepancies between the number of hours Applicant claimed and the hours recorded\nby the electronic badging system of his agency.  One investigation was performed by\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and covered approximately three months in 2002.  The time\nperiod was later expanded when Applicant refused to cooperate with the\ninvestigation.  Later Applicant claimed that the badging system was inaccurate and\nthat he was attending classified meetings.  The badging system was tested and found\nto be accurate, and Applicant provided no evidence (including travel records) of his\nattendance at meetings away from his primary worksite.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor\nfound that Applicant had claimed military leave on his time sheets, but had provided\nno paperwork to justify it.  The supervisor determined that Applicant had claimed\n157.21 hours which he had not worked.   \n1\nThe security director investigated the time sheet discrepancies as well.  He\nfound no substantiation for Applicant\u2019s explanations of the discrepancies.  The\nsecurity director found three instances when Applicant claimed to be at work when\nelectronic records showed that Applicant was at the gym.  The security director found\nthat 218.26 hours were unaccounted for. \nApplicant\u2019s agency department head reviewed the supervisor\u2019s report and a\nresponse by Applicant.  In his response,  Applicant provided several explanations for\nthe discrepancies\u2014e.g., that he was working on secret projects the existence of which\nhe could not divulge to his supervisor, that he was on annual leave, that he was\nclaiming hours to make up for uncompensated overtime hours he had already\nworked, that the electronic badging system was inaccurate, or that he was performing\nreserve military duty.  The department head found Applicant\u2019s explanations to be\nincredible and /or unsubstantiated.  The supervisor and department head found that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct diminished his trustworthiness, and the department head\nproposed Applicant\u2019s removal from government service.\nAs Department Counsel points out, the Judge overlooked significant evidence in concluding\nthat Applicant did not falsify his time sheets.  There is substantial evidence that the three government\nofficials who were involved in investigating Applicant\u2019s conduct found Applicant\u2019s explanations for\nthe discrepancies on his time sheets to be incredible and/or unsubstantiated.  The Judge found\n\nDirective, Personal Mitigating Condition 17(c):  \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\n2\nbehavior is to infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nDirective, Personal Mitigating Condition 17(d):  \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\n3\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d \nDirective, Personal mitigating Condition 17(e): \u201cthe individual has taken steps to reduce or eliminate\n4\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d \nThe Judge\u2019s decision contains a lengthy footnote discussing her appraisal of  limitations on the Board\u2019s review\n5\nauthority.  Decision at 7-8.  It is well-settled that the Board reviews decisions from the Hearing Office, as opposed to\nthe other way around.  See Directive, Enclosure 3, and ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009).\n5\nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony to be credible and accepted it at face value.  While a Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations are entitled to deference, such a determination does not relieve the Judge\nof the obligation to decide how much weight can properly be given to an applicant\u2019s testimony in\nlight of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-02486 at 7 (App. Bd. Aug. 31,\n2004), citing Anderson v. City of Bessemer, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985).  The record as a whole does\nnot support the Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s recording of his time and attendance while\nin government service. \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s application of Personal Conduct Mitigating\nConditions 17(c) , (d) , and (e)  is unsupported by record evidence and fails to consider a critical\n2\n3\n4\naspect of the case.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention has merit.  The Judge referred to portions of\nApplicant\u2019s testimony and found that portions of Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 17 (c), (d),\nand (e) partially apply in Applicant\u2019s case.  The fact that there is some mitigating evidence does not\ncompel the Judge to grant a security clearance.  As the trier of fact, the Judge must weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  In deciding whether the Judge has weighed the evidence in a reasonable manner, the\nBoard considers whether the Judge exercised common sense and sound judgment and made findings\nof fact and reached conclusions that reflect a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the record\nevidence as a whole, taking into account whether there is record evidence that runs contrary to the\nJudge\u2019s findings and conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-02892 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2004) .\n5\nIn discussing mitigation as to Applicant\u2019s time and attendance sheets, the Judge mentions only one\nof the explanations Applicant gave for the discrepancies and accepts that explanation.  The record\nindicates that another of Applicant\u2019s explanations for discrepancies on his time sheets was that he\nwas on military leave.  Applicant was asked during the investigation process to provide\ndocumentation for his military leave. Applicant provided evidence only of inactive duty training, for\nwhich military leave is not authorized.  When the record was held open after the hearing for him to\nprovide documentation of his reserve duty, he failed to do so.  Moreover, the record evidence\nindicates that responsible government officials found Applicant\u2019s explanations to be incredible or\nunsubstantiated and his conduct to have diminished his trustworthiness to the extent that the agency\nproposed to remove him from his job, although he was eventually allowed to resign.\n\n6\nDepartment Counsel understands the Judge\u2019s decision as saying that she is prohibited from\nconsidering conduct that was not \u201ccharged\u201d against Applicant by his previous employer.  To the\nextent that such a reading is what the Judge intended, then Department Counsel is correct that the\nJudge erred.  There is no prohibition in the Directive against considering security-related conduct\nmerely because a previous employer chose not to pursue it in a particular forum.   \nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause it fails to consider a critical aspect of the case.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.\nDepartment Counsel points to the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the discrepancies on Applicant\u2019s time\nsheets were \u201cthe result of carelessness.\u201d  Decision at 12.  Department Counsel contends that the\nJudge failed to consider crucial record evidence to the contrary.  In discussing the issues of\nfalsification and mitigation above, the Board concluded that the Judge committed harmful error in\naccepting Applicant\u2019s explanations of his conduct at face value rather than weighing Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony in light of the record evidence as a whole.  The same conclusion is applicable to the\nJudge\u2019s whole-person analysis.  The Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

The government offered 16\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 16, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted 15 exhibits\n(AE) A through O, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 26, 2008. I requested\nadditional information from Applicant and held the record open until December 8, 2008,\nfor Applicant to submit this information. On December 1, 2008, Applicant through\ncounsel, requested an additional 25 business days to obtain the information requested.\nFor good cause, I granted Applicant\u2019s request for an extension of time by Order dated\nDecember 2, 2008. On January 12, 2009, he timely submitted AE P, which was\nadmitted objection. The record closed on January 14, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 2, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 2.a of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 53 years old, works as software engineer and manager for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He started working for his current employer in May\n2008. He graduated from a major university in the United States (U.S.) in 1977 with a\nBachelor of Science degree in environmental resource management. He has taken\ncourse work towards a masters degree in business administration, but has not\ncompleted this degree. He married in 1978 and has two children, ages 22 and 13.1\nImmediately after graduating from college in 1977, Applicant enlisted in the U.S.\nNavy. He served on active duty until February 1984, when he resigned his commission\nand took a reserve commission. He continued as an active reservist until May 2004,\nwhen he became an inactive reservist. During this time, he served in Desert Storm, the\nfirst Gulf war. He retired from the Naval reserves in September 2006 with almost 30\nyears of military service and at the rank of Captain (O-6).2\nIn December 1984, Applicant started working for the Navy as a civilian employee.\nOver the years, his duties and responsibilities expanded. He held a top secret clearance\nand later, the Navy granted him a sensitive compartmented information (SCI) clearance.\nDuring the many years Applicant held a security clearance, the Navy never alleged or\ncharged him with any violations of security procedures nor is there any evidence that he\n\nGE 6, supra note 1, at 24-25; AE A to AE M; Tr. 34. I note, however, that the government has no burden any\n3\nsuch violations.\nTr. 43-44, 53-54.\n4\nTr. 42-43, 62-63, 74, 88-90.\n5\nGE 16; Tr. 59, 88-89.\n6\n3\nviolated security procedures. His references indicate that he always followed security\nrules.3\nBy 1998, Applicant was a senior scientific and technical intelligence officer with a\nstaff of 10 to supervise. His work involved special access programs, which he called\nwhite and black programs. White programs are specific programs acknowledged as\ndefense programs. In the late summer of 2002, through his work in a white program, he\nbegan working in black programs. Black programs are special access programs which\nrequire a SCI clearance and are programs which the Navy does not publicly\nacknowledge their existence. Applicant split his work time between both programs. His\npayment for work on the black programs came as a result of a paper trail through the\nwhite programs. At the hearing, he declined on two occasions to provide any additional\ninformation on the black programs.4\nApplicant\u2019s second level supervisor had no access to black programs and his first\nlevel supervisor had access to one black program, which was different from Applicant\u2019s\nprograms. Accountability and assignments for the black programs came through a\ndifferent chain-of-command than his usual first and second level chain-of-command. As\na result, Applicant\u2019s supervisors had neither knowledge nor input on his work in the\nblack programs. Based on his understanding and belief that he could not reveal\nanything about his work in black programs, including when his work involved the black\nprograms, Applicant provided no information to his supervisors about his absence from\nhis office when his work on black programs took him out of his office to other locations\non the base or off the base. His unexplained absences created concerns with his\nmanagers about his whereabouts and what work was being performed. As the record\ncontains no evidence or even a reference to poor performance of actual duties, his\nmanagers\u2019 concern focused on whether he was actually working when his whereabouts\nwere unknown.5\nAt his last Navy civilian job site, the base had four different access systems,\nwhich were not linked together. Specifically, his office building was on a system different\nfrom other buildings in which he also worked. Applicant had three cards to access his\nwork locations on the base. One card gained him entry to the base; the second card\ngained him entry to his work building; and the third card gained him entrance to SCI\nareas outside his usual work building.6\nApplicant prepared his time and attendance sheets at the end of each week, not\non a daily basis, a process which was proper under the personnel regulations. He\n\nTr. 55-59, 71.\n7\nId. 40-41, 64-65; AE P.\n8\nGE 15 (Documents related to the revocation of Applicant\u2019s SCI clearance) at 11.\n9\n4\nreported his time spent on each work project each week. He, however, did not keep an\naccurate daily record of his time spent on various work projects or programs. Thus, his\ntime sheets reflected his honest belief about the actual amount of time worked on each\nprogram on any given day, rather than an accurate statement of the time worked based\non good record keeping on his daily work hours. At the hearing, Applicant\nacknowledged that his time keeping habits were not good because he did not keep an\naccurate daily record of the work he performed on various projects. He also\nacknowledged that as a result, he submitted inaccurate time records, which may have\nincluded, as work time, time spent at the gym. He always provided documentation to his\nsupervisors when he needed military leave. Applicant now enters his work time at the\nend of each workday. He programed his computer and blackberry so that he is\nreminded at the end of each day to record his work hours.7\nApplicant possessed a government travel credit card for his civilian job. In the\npast, he also had a government credit card or received advance payment for his military\nreserve expenses. In 1998, the Navy withdrew authorization for a separate travel card\nfor advance payment of reserve activities expenses. Applicant used his travel card to\npay for reserve duties expenses and for personal expenses when he did not have his\npersonal credit card with him. He admits that use of the government travel card for\npersonal purchases was against the rules. Because the government travel credit card\nbill came directly to him, he always paid his personal charges when he paid the bill. He\ndenies submitting any personal expenses for payment by the government and the\nrecord contains no evidence that he did. For a long time, Applicant also paid all of his\ngovernment travels expenses before receiving his reimbursement for these expenses\nbecause his base often took 90 days to reimburse him for his travel expenses. Towards\nthe end of 2002 or at the beginning of 2003, he stopped paying his travel expenses\nbefore the government reimbursed him for his expenses.8\nIn November 2002, a female employee filed a sexual harassment charge against\nApplicant. The Navy placed him on administrative leave until March 2003. While\ninvestigating this misconduct allegation, the Navy started a second investigation, which\nidentified problems with Applicant\u2019s time and attendance records and his use of a\ngovernment credit card. Although the Navy took no action on the sexual harassment\ncharge, on January 30, 2003, the Navy issued a proposal to remove Applicant from\nfederal service based on misuse of the government travel card for personal expenses\nand inaccurate time and attendance records.9\n\nNeither the proposal to remove nor his response with documentation are included in this record. Applicant\n10\ndoes not have copies of the documents sent with his response.\nW hen an agency removes an employee from federal service, the employee has a right to appeal the\n11\ndismissal to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), challenging the reasons for the removal. If an\nemployee appeals, the agency must prove all the elements of the charge it brings by a preponderance of the\nevidence. See Alvardo v. Department of Air Force, 103 M.S.P.R. 1 (2006).\nGE 15, supra note 9, at 37-39.\n12\nThe DONCAF letters granting Applicant\u2019s request for an extension of time are in the record, but Applicant\u2019s\n13\nrequests are not. GE 15.\n5\nApplicant timely responded to the proposal to remove and submitted\ndocumentation to be considered.  In March 2003, Applicant submitted his resignation\n10\nwhen he recognized that the investigation into his conduct was \u201cnot going well\u201d. The\nagency refused to accept and process his resignation. On March 14, 2003, the agency\nissued a notice of decision on proposal to remove. On March 20, 2003, Applicant and\nthe agency entered into a settlement agreement. Under the terms of the agreement,\nApplicant agreed to resign his position effective, March 21, 2003, to comply with all\ncheckout procedures, to reimburse the agency $3,827.70 for time, to turn in all his\ngovernment equipment, badges and decals, and to waive all his legal rights as a federal\nemployee, including his right to appeal his job termination to the Merit System\nProtection Board.  Applicant did not waive his right to appeal any adjudication of his\n11\nsecurity clearance. The agency agreed to accept the settlement agreement as a\nresolution of the discipline for Applicant\u2019s misconduct and to cancel the removal action,\nto implement the terms of the agreement, to notify the Department of Navy Central\nAdjudication Facility (DONCAF) of his resignation, to not enter either the proposal to\nremove or the decision to remove letters in Applicant\u2019s Official Personnel Folder (OPF),\nalthough his OPF would reflect that he resigned after being issued a notice of adverse\naction for misconduct, and to pay any unpaid local and travel claims for expenses if\nsubmitted by Applicant. The parties complied with the terms of the settlement\nagreement.12\nSubsequent to his resignation as a civilian employee, on April 18, 2003, the\nDONCAF issued a Letter of Intent (LOI) to revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance and\neligibility for access to SCI and a SOR, which referenced security concerns under\nGuidelines E, F and I. Applicant received the LOI on May 22, 2003. He immediately\nrequested a 45-day extension of time to reply as he needed records from the agency.\nHe provided a letter from the agency dated August 12, 2003, advising it would process\nhis request for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and could not\ngive him a time estimated for when he would receive the information. He requested four\nmore extensions of time because the agency had not provided him with the information\nhe had requested. The DONCAF granted three more extensions of time.  On April 22,\n13\n2004, DONCAF denied his last request for an extension of time, and issued a letter of\nRevocation (LOR) on the grounds he did not answer the LOI and revoked his clearance.\nTwo days after his clearance was denied, he received a letter from the agency general\n\nGE 15, supra note 9, at 1-33; GE 16.\n14\nGE 7; GE 8; GE 9; GE 10; GE 11; GE 12; GE 13; GE 14.\n15\nAE A to AE O; Tr. 21-27, 45-46.\n16\nGE 16; AE O; Tr. 46-47.\n17\n6\ncounsel apologizing for the delay. Applicant believes this information was deliberately\nwithheld by the person who conducted the investigation for the agency. He also\nbelieves that this individual wanted his job and did not conduct a full and complete\ninvestigation as information Applicant provided was not verified and persons were not\ncontacted. The decision to remove letter indicates that the investigator only checked\naccess to Applicant\u2019s usual office building, not other buildings. It also verified that his\nreferences for black programs  provided no information on his work time.14\nApplicant obtained employment with a Department of Defense contractor after he\nresigned from federal service. The Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office\n(DISCO) converted his military service clearance to a top secret clearance for his new\nemployer. The government revoked this clearance after receiving notice that the\nDONCAF had revoked his clearance as a Navy reservist in April 2004. The government\nbased the second revocation on the DONCAF\u2019s revocation and did not conduct a new\ninvestigation.15\nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from 14 individuals who worked\nwith him and know him. All describe him as a professional and excellent leader. All\nopine that he would not compromise or jeopardize classified information or national\nsecurity. One individual stated that he was proactive in protecting classified information\nand another indicated that he always followed the security rules. All praised his work\nskills and work ethics. Applicant testified that if a foreign agency approached him, he\nwould not tell or give the agent anything and he would contact the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation immediately. Based on his general knowledge, his witness also testified to\na hypothetical and to his belief that if Applicant was approached by a foreign agent,\nApplicant would break his arm and then turn him into authorities. This witness has no\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified information.16\nApplicant does not own property outside of the U.S. His most recent credit report\nindicates that his bills are paid and he does not have any unpaid debts. His budget\nshows he lives within his monthly income. He has money in a 401k account. Applicant\nsuffers from depression and anxiety and has been treated for these conditions since\nreturning from Desert Storm.17\nWhen he completed his SF-86, Applicant provided the information concerning the\nloss of his job and his security clearance. He has been open and honest about the\nproblems and his perception as to why this situation occurred. In hindsight, he\nacknowledged that his poor time keeping caused problems with his time and attendance\nrecords and he wrongly used his government travel credit card for personal expenses.\n\nGE 6. \n18\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n19\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE#.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\n7\nHe still believes that he did not misuse his government travel credit card for reserve\nduty expenses and his witness confirms that the criteria for use of the government travel\ncredit card were not clear. He now carries only one personal credit card for his use.18\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n19\n\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of \u201cthe administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)( explaining\nstandard of review).\n8\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\n\nDepartment Counsel argued that I should find that Applicant intentionally and deliberately falsified his time\n20\nand attendance sheets. The agency did not charged applicant with intentional falsification or fraud in regards\nto his time and attendance. It is beyond my authority to review and redecide the agency\u2019s decision on the\ncharges made against Applicant for misconduct. \n9\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n. . .\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\nIn the instant case, the Applicant has not omitted any information from his\nsecurity clearance application or any other document as specified in AG \u00b6 16(a). Rather,\nhe provided the negative information in his SF-86 which became the basis for the SOR.\nThus, AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable in this case.20\nApplicant\u2019s use of his government travel credit card for personal expenses is a\nclear violation of the rules for use of this card, which he acknowledged. Applicant\u2019s\nagreement to reimburse the government for some of the work time previously paid, but\nnot worked, reflects a significant misuse of the government\u2019s resources. Thus, the\ngovernment has established a security concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) and 16(d)(4).\n\n10\nUnder AG \u00b6 17, Applicant could mitigate security concerns under the following\nconditions:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\nApplicant\u2019s time and attendance issues occurred between September 2002 and\nDecember 2002, more than six years ago. More importantly, this issue arose when he\nwas working in black programs. He could not reveal the work he was doing and\nmistakenly believed that he could not tell his supervisors when he was actually working\non black programs. Since Applicant no longer works for the Navy and will not be\nworking in black programs, the source of his time problems has been eliminated. AG \u00b6\n17(c) has partial applicability to his time and attendance issue only.\nApplicant has acknowledged his behavior on a number of occasions. In response\nto questions on the SF-86 about his past employment, Applicant clearly acknowledged\nhis resignation after receiving an adverse action for misconduct and explained the\nmisconduct. He also acknowledged that he lost his security clearance in 2004. He\nadmits that his conduct resulted in his job loss and revocation of his security clearance.\nHe changed his habits and behavior to prevent problems with his time records and\ncredit card use in the future. His blackberry and computer remind him at the end of each\nday to complete his time sheet and he does. He no longer uses a business credit card\nand does not intend to do so in the future. By admitting his conduct, changing how he\nhandles his time and limiting his access to credit cards, Applicant has taken positive\nsteps to eliminate or reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, duress and coercion. Thus,\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) apply partially.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n11\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security\nconcerns. In the instant case, the government failed to present any evidence which\nindicates that Applicant\u2019s has financial problems. Applicant\u2019s admissions about his use\nof his government credit card for personal purchases, however, raise a security concern\nunder AG \u00b6 19(d) \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . and other\nintentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d \nApplicant submitted evidence which indicates that he lives within his financial\nmeans and has paid his bills as required. He paid his personal purchases each month\nafter receiving his bill for his government credit card. His evidence does not reflect a\nneed to use the government credit card for purchases because he did not have\nresources available to him. Rather, Applicant used his government travel credit card for\npersonal convenience. Applicant\u2019s use of the government credit card occurred over six\nyears ago. His past conduct does not reflect on his current trustworthiness and\nreliability. He no longer uses a business credit card so as to ensure he will not use such\na card for personal purposes. Guideline F is found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both good\nand bad. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record to\ndetermine if a security concern is shown. A determination on an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\na security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but\non a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern.\n\n12\nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nmisconduct while holding a senior intelligence officer position is serious. His misuse of\ntime was not intentional, but the result of carelessness, poor record keeping, and his\nwork in black programs. The record lacks any evidence that Applicant misused\ngovernment time over a long period of time. The misuse of time issue coincides with his\nfew months of work in the highly secret black programs. He acknowledged that despite\nhis belief that he could not reveal anything about what he was doing when working in\nthe black program, he should have advised his supervisors when he started working in\nthe black programs. His use of the credit card for personal expenses violated the rules\nand he knew it. He never sought financial payment from the government for these\nexpenses. He always paid these charges from his own finances. The government did\nnot incur any financial losses or other harm because of his conduct. If anyone incurred a\nloss, it was Applicant because, at times, he used his own money to pay his government\ntravel expenses which resulted in a loss of use of his money.\nApplicant served as an active duty service member or as a reservist in the U.S.\nmilitary for nearly 30 years without any misconduct issues. By serving in Iraq during the\nfirst Gulf war, Applicant put his country before his life. For 18 years prior to 2002, he\nworked for the Navy as a civilian without any misconduct. He always safeguarded the\ngovernment\u2019s secrets and always followed the rules for guarding these secrets. His co-\nworkers all agree that he would never betray the government\u2019s trust by compromising\nclassified information.  He would report any approaches by a foreign agent to the proper\nauthorities immediately. While I recognize that the Appeal Board does not view past\ncompliance with security rules as a determinate for future compliance with security rules\nwhen questions of misconduct arise, 25 years of security rules compliance warrants\nsome credit under the whole person concept to ensure Applicant receives a fair and\nimpartial evaluation of all evidence in the record. Applicant\u2019s recognizes his poor\nbehavior and has taken definitive steps to prevent a future occurrence of the same\nconduct. \nApplicant has sufficient income to pay his bills and has a substantial 401(k)\naccount. His credit report reflects good financial management. He did not use his\ngovernment travel credit card because he did not have access to a credit card or funds,\nbut used the card for convenience. He frequently used the card for reserve duty\nexpenses, which he believed to be a proper use of the card. The record contains no\nevidence that it was illegal to use the card for reserve expenses. Applicant understands\nthat he acted improperly on matters related to work. He, however, has never acted\ncontrary to the government\u2019s interest in matters of security. He fully understands the\nneed to protect classified information and has done so many times. He has taught\n\nThe record is incomplete because it does not contain all the relevant information concerning the investigation\n21\nof his misconduct, including the proposal to remove and his response with documents. The decision to remove\nApplicant indicates that the agency only reviewed access to his building not other buildings where he\nperformed black program work. The decision also supports his contention that his black program work would\nnot be verified. The lack of thoroughness in the investigation failed to confirm the paper trail for his black\nprogram time in a white program. Based on my years of experience as a federal sector employment lawyer\nbefore becoming an administrative judge, I have serious concerns about the completeness of the investigation\nand the ultimate determination. In any proceeding before the MSPB, the agency would be required to produce\nthis missing evidence and to establish all the allegations in the proposal to remove.\n13\nothers to do the same. In fact, his desire to fully comply with this duty may be the\nreason for his time and attendance issues.21\nThe ultimate question is whether Applicant\u2019s past negative conduct presents a\nsecurity concern about his current fitness to hold a security clearance. I find that it does\nnot. When weighing his conduct 2002 against his long years of service to the U.S., he\nmilitary service in Iraq during the first Gulf war, and his strict adherence to security rules\nand procedures for many years, I find that overall, Applicant past conduct does not raise\nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct.\nThe government did not establish its case under Guideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He has been married for over 13 years and has two middle school age children. He has held a security clearance since 1994 while employed by various defense contractors (Tr. 30-31; Gov. Ex. 1.

The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on \nAugust 12, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 17, 2008.  He admitted the \nfactual allegations with explanation under Guideline F and denied the falsification \nallegations under Guideline E.  He provided an explanation for his admissions and \ndenials, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department counsel \nwas prepared to proceed on October 22, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOctober 23, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 27, 2008, for a hearing \non November 18, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered \nnine exhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 9, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant submitted two documents, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. \nEx.) A-B, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The \nrecord was left open until December 5, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments.  Applicant timely submitted four additional documents marked App. Ex. C-F.  \nThe government did not object to the admission of the documents (See Gov. Ex. 10, \nDepartment Counsel Letter, dated December 4, 2008).  The documents are admitted \ninto the record.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 26, \n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and has been an information assurance officer for a \ndefense contractor for about 18 months.  He served as an active and reserve enlisted \nmember of the Army for over six years.  He received a technology certificate from a \ncomputer learning center.  He has been married for over 13 years and has two middle \nschool age children.  He has held a security clearance since 1994 while employed by \nvarious defense contractors (Tr. 30-31; Gov. Ex. 1. Public Trust Position Application (SF \n85P), dated June 22, 2006; Gov. Ex. 2, Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF \n86), dated August 24, 2007).   \n \n \nThe SOR alleges (See Gov. Ex. 7, credit report, dated July 11, 2006; Gov. \nEx. 8, credit report, dated September 27, 2007; Gov. Ex.9, credit report, dated March 7, \n2008) list the following delinquent debts for Applicant: $1,147.60 charged off for a \nfinance company (SOR 1.a); an IRS tax lien for $8,627 for tax year 2002 (SOR 1.b, \nGov. Ex. 6 Judgment and tax lien); a charged off debt to a catalog company for $801 \n(SOR 1.c); a student loan in collection for $23,960 (SOR 1.d); a judgment by a home \nowners association for $545 (SOR 1.e; Gov. Ex. 4, Judgment, dated November 19, \n2004); another judgment for the same home owner's association for $880 (SOR 1.f; \nGov. Ex. 5 Judgment dated June 6, 2006); and another IRS tax lien for tax year 2006 \nfor $21,889 (SOR 1.g).  While Applicant admitted the debts in his answer to the SOR, \nhis explanation indicates that he has either disputed, paid, or is paying the debts. \n \nThe $1,147.60 debt to the finance company is for books and learning material for \nhis daughter that Applicant and his wife purchased from a door-to-door salesperson in \nabout 1998 (SOR 1.a).  Applicant received some of the material and was dissatisfied \nwith the material he received.  He paid for about 75% of the material and returned what \nhe had received.  In 2007, he received an IRS form 1099-C noting a cancellation of debt \nfrom the finance company (See Answer to SOR, Form 1099-C, dated August 20, 2007).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant did not realize the debt had been charged off until he received security \nclearance interrogatories to answer (Tr. 31-34). \n \nApplicant and his wife were notified by the IRS that they owed approximately \n$8,600 for tax year 2002 (SOR 1.b).  Applicant's wife talked to IRS agents and reached \nan agreement to have funds deducted from her pay account to pay the debt.  Applicant \nis unaware of when his wife made the agreement or the terms of the agreement.  \nApplicant and his wife filed an amended tax return for 2002 on March 1, 2008, and listed \n$5,286 as the amount owed (Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to interrogatories, dated March 5, \n2008, at 20-24).  Funds have been deducted from his wife's pay.  At the hearing, \nApplicant believed that this IRS debt has been paid.  However, the IRS information \nprovided by Applicant after the hearing shows the principle of the tax was paid and \ninterest payments of $1,561.32 remain to be paid.  Funds are still taken from Applicant's \nwife's pay to pay tax liens (Tr. 35-40, 82-85; App. Ex. F, IRS Account Transcript, dated \nDecember 3, 2008).   \n \nThere is a second IRS tax lien for tax year 2006 listed in the SOR for $21,889 \n(SOR 1.g).  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt but stated that the \ndebt was not accurate.  He stated an accurate tax return for 2006 has been filed, the \nlien should not have been on his record, and is reflected as satisfied on his latest credit \nreport.  Department Counsel noted that there is no independent information in the case \nfiles to verify this debt (Tr. 59-66).  The 2006 amended tax return for 2006 shows \nApplicant and his wife owed taxes of $8,354 to the IRS.  Applicant also noted that funds \nare still being taken from his wife's pay to pay this tax lien.  Applicant and his wife \nprepared their own tax returns and did not have a professional tax preparer provide \nassistance on either the 2002 or 2006 tax return (Tr. 82-84).  I find from the totality of \nthe information that there is a tax debt for tax year 2006 which is being paid by \ndeductions from Applicant's wife's pay.   \n \nApplicant stated the catalog company debt of $801 was his wife's (SOR 1.c).  \nApplicant stated he first learned of the debt when he received the request for \nInterrogatories.  In response to the Interrogatories, Applicant stated that the debt was \ndisputed with the catalog company and was charged off (Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to \nInterrogatories, dated March 5, 2008 at 4).  In his testimony at the hearing, Applicant \nstated that his wife contacted the company and she paid the debt in full. (Tr. 40-44).  \nApplicant did not provide documented information on the status of this debt even though \nprovided the opportunity to do so. \n \nApplicant received student loans in the 1990s totaling $24,043.69 to attend a \ncomputer school working towards a certificate as an electronic technician (SOR 1.d).  \nAfter graduation, he was not immediately able to secure a good paying job in his field.  \nHe received contract work when he could and made payments on the loan.  He was \nunable to continue the payments on a recurring basis since he was not regularly \nemployed.  After being reminded of the debt when he was served interrogatories, he \nmade arrangements to rehabilitate the student loans.  He entered an agreement with \nthe creditor to make payments of $250 per month to rehabilitate the loan (See Letter \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfrom ECMC and Agreement, Answer to SOR, dated September 10, 2008).  Applicant \nwas advised that his student loan account had been successfully rehabilitated and he \nwas assigned to an education credit service company for continued payment of the \nloan.  The amount of the loan remaining is now $21,779.20.  His new agreement is for \n$145 per month which is taken by direct deposit from his bank account (Tr. 24-26, 44-\n52, 86-88; App. Ex. A, Letter, dated November 5, 2008; App. Ex. D, Repayment \nAgreement and Account Debit request, dated November 10, 2008). \n \nThere were two judgments placed against Applicant by the Homeowner's \nassociation where his house is located (SOR 1.e and 1.f).  In answers to interrogatories, \nApplicant forwarded a garnishment summons for Applicant's wife's employer for the \npayment of the judgment.  The garnishment amount is for $1,482.73 and dated \nDecember 19, 2007.  There is a notation that $776.06 was paid on February 11, 2008 \n(Gov. Ex. 3, Answer to Interrogatories, dated March 5, 2008, at 26 Garnishment \nSummons).  The judgments have been satisfied (Tr. 52-57, 88-94; App. Ex. E, Letter, \ndated October 8, 2008).   \n \nApplicant presented his latest credit report.  It shows only the catalog company \ndebt and student loan accounts as delinquent.  There is an account for a dental bill that \nApplicant stated he has paid.  Applicant has not received or sought credit counseling for \nhis debts (Tr. 77-78; App. Ex. B, credit report, dated November 17, 2008). \n \nApplicant initially submitted an application for a public trust position (SF 85P) in \nJune 2006 while working for a defense contractor.  Applicant left the employment of the \ncontractor before a final decision was made on this application.  He started work with \nhis present defense contractor employer and the contractor had Applicant file a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86) in August 2007.  The responses to \nquestions on these two security clearance applications submitted by Applicant raise \nsecurity concerns.   \n \nThe 2006 public trust position application (Gov. Ex. 1) has a negative response \nto question 19 which asked in the last seven years did he have any judgments not paid.  \nThere was also a negative response to question 20 asking if Applicant was over 180 \ndays delinquent on any loan or federal obligation.  On the 2007 Questionnaire for \nNational Security Position (Gov. Ex. 2), there was a negative response to questions 27 \nc and d asking in the last seven years if he had any liens placed against property for \nfailing to pay taxes or other debts, and if there were judgments he had not paid.  There \nwas also a negative response to questions 28 a and b asking if he had any debts in the \nlast seven years over 180 days delinquent or presently had any debts more than 90 \ndays delinquent.  At the time Applicant completed these applications, there were \ndelinquent debts from the catalog company and student loans that had been past due \nover 180 days in the last seven years and presently debts past due over 90 days.  Also, \ntwo judgments and two tax liens had been filed against Applicant and his wife.   \n \nIn completing the public trust position application in 2006, Applicant knew of the \ntax lien for tax year 2002 but did not list this lien on either application because he \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbelieved it had been paid off and did not have to be noted on the applications.  His wife \nmade all of the contact with the IRS on the tax liens.  After 2002, he had not seen or \nreceived any correspondence from the IRS informing him that he owed a debt.  He \nknew his wife had discussed the debts with the IRS and had entered a payment plan \nwith them.  He knew his wife was still having funds taken from her pay for the 2002 tax \nlien.  He does not remember receiving notification from the IRS that the 2002 tax lien \nhad been satisfied.  Applicant also knew he had delinquent student loans.  In \ncompleting the 2006 Public Trust Position application, he knew he had been making \nsporadic payments on the loans so he did not believe he was over 180 days past due \non the loans.  When he completed the 2006 application, he also knew about the \nhomeowner's association judgments.  He believed the judgments were entered in error \nso he did not note them on the application.   \n \nAs for the 2007 Questionnaire for National Security Position, Applicant did not \nnote the IRS tax liens or the homeowner's association judgments because he believed \nthey had been paid.  He misinterpreted the questions on the application and did not \nbelieve he needed to list the liens or judgments.  He did not intend to provide false \ninformation because he knew his finances would be checked.  He tried to be as \naccurate as possible (Tr. 67-76). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The tax liens, judgments, and delinquent debts that Applicant admits and \nare listed in credit reports are a security concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting financial obligations.  These debts show a \nhistory of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns raised under financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15).  An applicant has the burden \nto refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating condition, and the burden of \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndisproving it never shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005)).   \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\" and determine it does not apply.  \nApplicant claims that most of his delinquent debts are either in dispute, paid or being \npaid.  He disputed the debt from the books he ordered for his daughter and paid the \ndebt that was owed.  He started paying on the 2002 tax lien in December 2007 and the \nlien has almost been satisfied.  Most of the remaining debts were not addressed until \nFebruary 2008.  The 2006 tax lien and the student loans are still being paid.  The \ncatalog company debt appears to be paid.  The homeowner's association judgments \nwere paid in October 2008.  Since some debts are still being paid, there are current \ndebts.  Applicant frequently incurred delinquent debts consisting of tax liens, judgments, \nstudent loans, and store loans.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\" and determine it applies to some \nof the debts.  The tax liens in 2002 and 2006 were incurred either because Applicant \nincorrectly filed or calculated his taxes.  He and his wife completed their tax return \nthemselves so any errors were within their control.  He has acted responsibly since he \nfiled amended returns and his wife is making payments on the debts owed.  As to the \nstudent loans, Applicant's sporadic employment was a condition beyond his control and \ndirectly led to his falling behind on payment of the loans.  He rehabilitated the loans and \nhas a payment agreement with the creditor.  He is making payments according to the \nagreement.  This shows that he acted responsible as to the student loans.  While he \nmay have had a dispute concerning the homeowner's fees, the dispute and the \nresolution were not beyond his control.  However, he has paid the judgments and they \nare satisfied. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol\" does not apply.  Applicant has not sought credit counseling but has managed \nhis finances on his own.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the ability to pay the debts, has shown a strong desire to pay them, and \nhas shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  He stated that his wife paid the catalog \ncompany debt.  However, he was unable to present proof of payment.  Considering that \nall other debts were paid as Applicant stated, I conclude his testimony that the catalog \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncompany debt is paid is sufficient to establish that fact.  Applicant provided proof that his \nwife paid the homeowner's association judgments.  Applicant has an agreement to pay \nhis student loans and he is current on paying the loans according to the agreement.  His \ntax liens are being paid according to an agreement with the IRS.  The government \nestablished Applicant's delinquent debts were a security concern.  The Applicant had \nthe burden to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern.  The information \npresented by Applicant is sufficient information to verify his claims.  Applicant has acted \nresponsibly towards his debts.  He has mitigated security concerns raised by his \nfinancial situation. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning financial issues involving judgments and tax \nliens raise a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \nAG \u00b6 16(a) \"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness\". \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  Applicant states that while he knew of \nthe tax liens and judgments, he thought they had been taken care of and did not need to \nbe listed on either the application for public trust position or the questionnaire for \nnational security position.  He was aware of the student loans but since he made \nsporadic payments, he did not know they were past due either 180 days or 90 days.  \nWhile there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification of a \nmaterial fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when \napplying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement \nis not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it \nis done knowingly and willfully.  The questions concerning tax liens and judgments are \nvery clear.  The questions ask if in the last seven years, the applicant had judgments or \ntax liens placed against them.  Applicant stated he misinterpreted or misread the \nquestion.  It is plausible that Applicant did not understand the question.  Because of his \nlack of understanding, he established that he did not deliberately provide false \ninformation on the security clearance application with intent to deceive.  I find for \nApplicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered that while Applicant \nencountered delinquent debts, two tax liens, and two judgments, he has taken \nresponsible and reasonable actions to resolve the debts.  He paid the debt on the books \nand to the catalog company.  He is paying the tax liens and has paid the two judgments.  \nHe rehabilitated his student loans and is now current with the payments.  Applicant lives \nwithin his means and meets his personal financial obligations.  His actions do not \nindicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations.  He did not provide incomplete information on his security clearance \napplication with the intent to deceive.  He misunderstood the questions regarding the \nstate of his finances.  Overall, on balance, the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Michael Lyles, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Investigations Processing dated\nJanuary 27, 2006.  On April 9, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 30, 2008, in which\nhe elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on December 3, 2008.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on December 16, 2008, and he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to\nanother Administrative Judge on February 13, 2009, and was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on March 16, 2009.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe FORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 33 years old and married.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with\nhis employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits all of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 14, 2006, and November 26,\n2007, indicate that he remains indebted to sixteen creditors in the amount of\napproximately $16,585.00.  (Government Exhibits 10 and 11).  The delinquent accounts\ncomprise debt associated with personal and household expenses, loans, credit cards,\nmedical services, utilities and back child support.  \nThe Applicant attributes his financial problems to \u201cpoor budgeting skills\u201d after he\nseparated from the Air Force in 2000.  From 2000-2003, he was employed but did not\nearn enough money to cover his expenses.  He claims that his former wife opened\nsome financial accounts and included him on the accounts without his knowledge.  They\ndivorced in October 2001.  He states that his new job increased his salary sufficient to\nrepay his delinquent debts and that he has developed a budget which shows how he\nplans to cover his expenses and debt repayments.  Applicant did not to submit any\ndocumentation to support his claim.  \nApplicant also claims that he and his current wife have made a mutual decision\nto move into a small apartment on top of her store in order to cut down on their\nexpenses, get current with their bills, and then begin the long process of paying back\ntheir old delinquent debts.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR).  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material\naspects of his personal background during the employment process.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he has engaged in criminal\nactivity which creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\n\n3\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing dated January 27, 2006. \nQuestion 23(f) of the application asked the\nApplicant if in the last seven years he has been arrested for, charged with, or convicted\nof any offense(s) not listed listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e.  The Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).  This was a false answer.  Applicant failed to\nlist that he was arrested twice in 2002 for Contempt of Court, Failure to Pay Child\nSupport/comply with Court Order.  (Government Exhibit 5).  \nQuestion 24(a) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if since the age of\nsixteen or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, has he illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics, etc.  The Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).  This was a\nfalse answer.  Applicant failed to disclose that he used marijuana at least twice in\nFebruary 2000, after he received his General Discharge from the United States Air\nForce.  (Government Exhibit 5).  \nQuestion 27(b) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if in the last seven\nyears has he had his wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any reason.\nThe applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).  This was a false answer.  He\nfailed to list the fact that his car was repossessed in early 2002.  (Government Exhibit\n5).\nQuestion 28(a) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if in the last seven\nyears has he been over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered,\n\u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 4).  This was a false answer.  He failed to list that in the last\nseven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on fourteen of the seventeen debts\nlisted in the SOR.  (Government Exhibit 5).\nQuestion 28(b) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if he was currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government\nExhibit 4).  This was a false answer.  He failed to list that at the time he filled out the\nquestionnaire he was over 90 days delinquent on fifteen of the seventeen debts listed in\nthe SOR.  (Government Exhibit 5).\nThe Applicant admits that he was \u201cwrong to put NO for all of those questions\u201d.\nHe states that he was \u201crushing though the paperwork\u201d so that he could get a better\npaying job overseas to earn a better salary that would allow him to pay his delinquent\ndebt.  (Government Exhibit 3).    \nI find that the Applicant deliberately failed to answer the questions accurately on\nthe questionnaire because he intentionally wanted to conceal the truth from the\ngovernment.  By deliberately providing false information to the Government on this\nquestionnaire, the Applicant violated federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section\n1001.   \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\n\n5\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30(a) The Concern.  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor unwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility, dishonesty and criminal conduct which\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F), that he has been untruthful on\nhis Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (Guideline E) and that he violated\nfederal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, when he did so (Guideline J).\nThis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n7\nWith respect to his finances, the Applicant has in excess of $16,500.00 in\ndelinquent debt.  The record is void as to any evidence of mitigation.  He has not paid\nany of his delinquent debts although he indicates that he recently set up a payment\nplan.  Giving him the benefit of the doubt, it can be said that he just started the financial\nrehabilitation process, but he has a long way to go before his delinquent debts are\nresolved.  At the present time, he has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate\na track record of financial responsibility or that he has resolved his financial\nindebtedness.\nUpon review of his financial statement, it appears that he has little disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his past due bills.  There is little evidence of\nfinancial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nDisqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions\napply.  His financial problems remain current and they are not isolated.  The Applicant\nhad not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve his debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Applicant deliberately concealed material\ninformation from the Government on his security clearance application in response to\nhis arrest record, drug involvement and financial matters.  With the particular evidence\nthat I have been provided, there is no reasonable excuse for his failure to answer the\nquestions truthfully. He was obviously not careful or serious when he was filling out the\nanswering to the questions on the application.  Consequently, the evidence shows that\nthe Applicant cannot be trusted with the national secrets.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)\nthe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \nBy deliberately concealing material information from the Government, the\nApplicant violated Federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.\nDisqualifying Condition 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and\n31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  Therefore, Guideline J is also found against him.\n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \n\n8\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.

On June 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 18, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 8, \n2008. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 13, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September \n10, 2008. The government called one witness and offered Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1 through \n7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called \none witness and submitted three documents which were marked as Applicant Exhibits \nOctober 21, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n(AE) A \u2013 C and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr) on September 22, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nOn August 18, 2008, Department Counsel prepared a motion to amend the SOR \nand forwarded the amendment to Applicant. The motion to amend added \nsubparagraphs 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d. On August 25, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \namendments. There being no objection to the amendment from Applicant at hearing, \nthe amendment was allowed in accordance with Enclosure 3, Additional Procedural \nGuidance, of the Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.17. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 18, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e., and denied SOR \u00b6 2.a. In response to the SOR amendment, \ndated August 18, 2008, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d.   \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems engineer employed by a Department of \nDefense contractor seeking a security clearance.  This is his first time applying for a \nsecurity clearance.  He has worked for his current employer for three years. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s of Science degree in computer engineering technology. He is single and has \nno children. (Tr at 6-8; Gov 1.)   \n \nOn August 23, 2005, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) in order to apply for a security clearance. Applicant \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to \u201cSection 23. Your Police Record: For this item report \ninformation regardless of whether the report in your case has been \u201csealed\u201d or stricken \nfrom the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions \nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. Have you \never been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d (Gov \n1.)   \n \nOn the same e-QIP application, Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to Section \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 \nyears, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for \nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, \ncodeine, heroin, etc.) amphetamines, depressants (barbituates, methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.) hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d (Gov 1.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed several arrests. In May 1999, he \nwas charged with Possession of Drug Paraphernalia and Possession of Cannabis. He \nwas 15 years-old at the time. He was caught with a bag of marijuana in his pocket at \nschool. A friend had given it to him. A classmate saw the marijuana in his pocket and \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntold the teacher. The police were called and Applicant was arrested. After community \nservice and teen court, the charges were expunged. Applicant claims he had never tried \nor taken drugs prior to this incident.  He did not deliberately omit this arrest from his e-\nQIP application. He claims that he thought he did not have to list it because the case \nwas expunged from his records because he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest. (Tr \nat 63; Gov 2; Gov 7; Answer to SOR.) \n \n  In 2003, he was given a verbal warning for trespass for drinking in a park after \nhours. In August 2004, he was charged with careless driving. He also had numerous \ntraffic offenses that were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr at 63; Gov 6.)   \n \nOn September 7, 2006, Applicant was observed by Officer M. to be driving \nerratically. Officer M. was driving his private owned car into work to start the evening \nshift. He called a patrol officer who was on duty in the area who pulled over Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle. After his car was pulled over, Officer M. approached Applicant\u2019s car. He \nexplained the reason for the stop. Applicant was defensive and uncooperative. Officer \nM. noticed that Applicant and the inside of Applicant\u2019s car smelled heavily of burnt \ncannabis (i.e. marijuana). He asked Applicant if he had been smoking cannabis. \nApplicant replied, \u201cNot today.\u201d (Tr at 28-29.) \n \nOfficer M. informed Applicant that he had probable cause to search his car \nbecause the car smelled like burnt cannabis. Applicant replied, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. I \ndon\u2019t smoke weed in my car. I only smoke in my house.\u201d Upon search of Applicant\u2019s car, \nOfficer M. noticed a green leafy substance on the driver\u2019s side on the floor mat. He \nnoticed a pink-colored cigar tube on the floor of the passenger side of the car which was \naltered to be used as a device for smoking marijuana. The cigar tube had burnt black \nresidue inside and small pieces of what appeared to be marijuana.  The substance \ntested positive for marijuana in a subsequent field test. (Tr at 30 \u2013 31; Gov 4.)  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana, Possession of \nDrug Paraphernalia, and Careless Driving.  There were no passengers in Applicant\u2019s \ncar.  Officer M. completed an arrest report within 30 minutes of the charging affidavit. \nGovernment Exhibit 4 is a copy of the report he prepared. (Tr at 31-32.) Applicant pled \nguilty to both charges and one charge was dropped. He was ordered to pay a $150 fine \nand court costs of $385.50. (Gov 5.)  \n \nOn October 3, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the Office \nof Personnel Management pertaining to his security clearance background \ninvestigation. During this interview, he detailed his arrest history. He stated that he does \nnot use drugs and has never used drugs. (Gov 2.) \n \nAn incident report, dated October 27, 2006, detailed Applicant\u2019s September 7, \n2006, arrest for possession of marijuana. It is unclear who prepared the report but the \nreport apparently summarizes a statement Applicant previously made. In the statement, \nApplicant states he was initially pulled over for careless driving. Marijuana was found on \nthe passenger\u2019s side of the car and he was arrested for possession of marijuana. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant claims the marijuana found in the car belonged to his friend, Mr. R., who left it \nin his car a few days earlier. Applicant apparently made the statement that he does not \nparticipate in the buying, taking, or selling any type of drugs and that he is willing to take \na drug test to prove it. (Gov 3.) \n \nMr. R., Applicant\u2019s friend, testified. He claims he would often roll joints in \nApplicant\u2019s car prior to working out. He claims that the marijuana found in Applicant\u2019s \ncar on September 7, 2006, was his. He claims that he is the only person that Applicant \nknows who uses marijuana.  He has never seen Applicant smoke marijuana. Applicant \nalways told him that he did not want marijuana in his car or in his house. In September \n2006, he saw Applicant an average of once a week.  He did not see him on the day he \nwas arrested. When Applicant told him about the arrest, he knew it was his fault but did \nnot come forward when Applicant appeared in court to admit the marijuana was his \nbecause he did not think it would do any good. Applicant never told him to appear with \nhim in court to take responsibility for the marijuana.  Mr. R. has been arrested for \nmarijuana possession on three occasions. He was arrested a couple times in 2002. His \nmost recent arrest was six months ago. The charges against him are still pending. He is \ngoing through drug court and hopes to have the charges dropped if he completes all the \nrequirements. (Tr at 43-60.)  \n \nThe Lab Manager where Applicant works states that Applicant has worked for \nhim since November 2005.  He has seen him progress from a college student to a well \nrounded mature and ethical engineer.  He has handled classified information on a daily \nbasis without incident. Applicant is a stellar performer and he recommends that his \nclearance be reinstated. (AE B.) Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations from 2005 to \n2007, rate him as a \u201csuccessful contributor.\u201d  He is noted as a good team player with \nexcellent verbal and written skills.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s 1999 arrest for Possession of Drugs, and Possession of Drug Paraphernalia \nand his arrest on September 7, 2006, for Possession of Marijuana, and Possession of \nDrug Paraphernalia. I find for Applicant with respect to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n\n \n6 \n \n \n1.d, and 1.e.  While the incidents happened, the record evidence is unclear as to \nwhether these were criminal offenses. These appear to be traffic offenses or citations as \nopposed to criminal offenses. \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence by way of exhibits and testimony \nto raise the CC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigated the security concerns (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. September 22, 2005.)   \n   \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not \napply with respect to Applicant\u2019s September 2006 arrest. Applicant was arrested after \nbecoming employed with a Department of Defense contractor. Not enough time has \npassed since his arrest to mitigate the concerns raised. Applicant\u2019s statements are \ninconsistent with the testimony of Officer M., the arresting officer. Questions remain \nabout his trustworthiness and judgment based on his conflicting statements to the \nofficer and his testimony at hearing. I find for Applicant with respect to the May 1999 \narrest because it occurred over nine years ago when Applicant was in high school.  \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) has the potential to apply. While it has been two years since \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in September 2006, concerns remain based on Applicant\u2019s failure to \naccept responsibility for his actions. He maintains that the marijuana found in the car \nbelonged to his friend, Mr. R.  Although Mr. R. testified that his marijuana was found in \nApplicant\u2019s car, his credibility is in question due to the fact that he did not come forward \nto state the marijuana was his during Applicant\u2019s criminal court proceeding. Mr. R. has a \nhistory of criminal conduct as well, having been arrested three times on marijuana \npossession charges.  \n \nOf the three individuals who testified during the hearing, I find the testimony of \nOfficer M. the most credible. When he approached Applicant in his car on the day of the \narrest, he observed the smell of burnt cannabis. No one else was in Applicant\u2019s car. \nEven if the marijuana in Applicant\u2019s car belonged to Mr. R., it does not explain the smell \nof burnt cannabis in Applicant\u2019s car on the night of his arrest \u2013 a good indicator that \nmarijuana was recently smoked.  When Officer M. asked Applicant whether he used \nmarijuana \u2013 Applicant replied \u201cNot today.\u201d Applicant further claimed that he only smokes \nmarijuana in his residence. While Applicant has a good employment record, his lack of \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntruthfulness about his September 7, 2006 arrest and his marijuana use remains a \nconcern.  \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omissions on his August 23, 2005, e-QIP application raises the \npotential application of Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) \n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities).  With respect to omitting his May 1999 arrest in response to question \n23(d) on his e-QIP application, I find Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate. Applicant \nclaims that he did not think that he had to list his 1999 arrest because it occurred when \nhe was still a juvenile and it was expunged from his criminal record. The plain language \nof question 23(d) asks:  \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses \nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d The question further states, \u201cFor this item report \ninformation regardless of whether the report in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or stricken \nfrom the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for certain convictions \nunder the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an \nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d Applicant \nis a college graduate. It is unlikely that he misunderstood the plain language of the \nquestion. I find Applicant deliberately omitted his May 1999 arrest for possession of \nmarijuana in response to question 23(d). \n \n \nI find Applicant did not falsify his answer to question 24, regarding illegal use of \ndrugs and drug activity. While Applicant was arrested for and possessed Marijuana in \n1999, there is nothing in the record evidence which implicates Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana since the age of 16 or within the seven years prior to Applicant completing his \ne-QIP application on August 23, 2005.  Applicant admits to possessing the marijuana \nwhen he was arrested in 1999, he denies using marijuana.  There is no evidence in the \nrecord contradicting Applicant\u2019s denials of marijuana use within seven years prior to \ncompletion of his e-QIP application.   \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThere is substantial evidence to support Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in \nSeptember 2006.  Officer M. noticed the smell of burnt marijuana when he approached \nApplicant\u2019s car on the date of his arrest which is strong evidence supporting that \nmarijuana was recently smoked. Applicant was alone in the car. He later told Officer M. \nthat he usually smoked marijuana at his residence. For these reasons, I conclude he \nprovided false information to the OPM investigator during his October 3, 2006, interview \nwhen he claimed he had never used any illegal drugs. This conduct raises PC DC \u00b6 \n16(e) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to \nan employer, investigator, security official, or competent medical authority or other \nofficial government representative).  Applicant\u2019s claims that he never used marijuana \nconflicts with the facts that led to his arrest on September 7, 2006.  \n \n \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.d. This allegation alleges that \nApplicant provided false information to his employer on October 27, 2006, by stating \nthat he had not previously participated in using illegal drugs. The evidence is support of \nthis allegation is an Incident Report that was entered into Joint Personnel Adjudication \nSystem (JPAS). I do not find the Incident Report to be reliable because it is not signed.  \nThe author of the report is unknown. The record is not authenticated. Applicant did not \ntestify to the accuracy of the document. The Government did not meet its burden with \nregard to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d.   \n \n \nIt is noted that the summary of Applicant\u2019s interview with an OPM investigator on \nOctober 3, 2006 is also unsigned and unsworn (the statement is relevant to SOR \u00b6 2.c). \nThe identity of the author of the summary of the interview is not apparent. While it may \nseem contradictory to conclude the government met its burden with respect to SOR \u00b6 \n2.c but not \u00b6 2.d, Applicant was sent a copy of the October 3, 2006 summary of \ninterview. He had the opportunity to review the document. He had the opportunity to \nmake changes to the document. Upon review of the document, he found the document \nto be an accurate summary of what occurred during the interview. (Gov 2.) Applicant \nwas not given the same opportunity with respect to the Incident Report. (Gov 3.)     \n \n \nPC DC 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. It is reasonable to conclude that \nApplicant did not want to admit that he used marijuana after being hired with a defense \ncontractor because of the adverse affect it might have on getting a security clearance as \nwell as the potential that he could lose his job for illegal drug use.  \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern may be mitigated.  The following Personal \nConduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) potentially apply: \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not \napply because Applicant did not disclose the omission of his 1999 arrest for possession \nof marijuana before being confronted with the facts.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment) does not apply.  If Applicant had been more honest about his \nmarijuana use, this mitigating condition may have been applicable. However, instead of \naccepting responsibility for his past actions, Applicant denies using marijuana on \nSeptember 7, 2006. He went to great lengths to have his friend lie for him by claiming \nthe marijuana that was found in Applicant\u2019s car was his. His friend\u2019s statements do not \nexplain why Officer M. smelled marijuana smoke when he approached Applicant\u2019s car. \nNor does his friend\u2019s testimony explain Applicant\u2019s statement to Officer M. that he \nsmokes marijuana in his residence. Applicant\u2019s dishonesty casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nPC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s \nmisrepresentations about his marijuana use makes him vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.  His repeated denials despite evidence to the contrary support \nthe premise that he has something to hide.  \n \n \nNone of the other PC MCs are relevant to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. He has \nnot mitigated the concerns raised under personal conduct.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork history and his record of no subsequent criminal conduct over a period of two \nyears.  However, not enough time has passed to mitigate the concerns raised under \nGuideline J. Applicant had worked for a defense contractor for nine months prior to his \nSeptember 2007 arrest. He submitted his security clearance application in August 2005. \nThe extensive questions about illegal drug use should have put him on notice that illegal \n\n \n10 \n \n \ndrug use is a security concern. He deliberately omitted his May 1999 arrest for \nPossession of Drugs/Possession of Drug Paraphernalia on his August 2005 e-QIP \napplication. There is overwhelming circumstantial evidence that Applicant used \nmarijuana prior to being arrested on September 7, 2006. His repeated denials of drug \nuse despite evidence to the contrary, raise questions about his trustworthiness. He did \nnot meet his burden to mitigate the concerns raised under personal conduct.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under criminal conduct, and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding error, we remand the case to\n1\nthe Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge found that Applicant, who works for a security service doing business with the\nDoD, invested in three rental properties.  He paid a total of $578,000 for them.  These sales were\nsubsequently discovered to have been part of a larger scheme to defraud people into purchasing real\nproperty at inflated prices.  Applicant now owes deficiency judgments resulting from foreclosure\nsales of the properties.   These debts have become delinquent.  Applicant contacted the company that\n2\npurchased the mortgages to work out a payment program or otherwise settle the matter.  However,\nthe company has insisted on full payment of all three debts.  One of the persons who sold Applicant\nthe properties was found dead of a gunshot wound in 2006, either a suicide or murder.  Another\nemployee of the mortgage company that initially held the mortgage note has pled guilty to fraud.\nApplicant has written a letter to the Attorney General of the state in question advising of the fraud.\nAt the close of the record he had not received a response.  Applicant holds two jobs, one earning him\n$65,000.00 a year and the other $18,000.00.  He has no debts other than these deficiency judgments.\n \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.\n\n3\nApplicant his not challenged the Judge\u2019s findings.  Therefore, they are not at issue in this\nappeal.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, the Judge concluded that the evidence would not support a\nper se favorable application of the mitigating conditions.  Given the extent of the debt, this\nconclusion is sustainable.  However, it is permissible for a Judge nevertheless to decide in an\nApplicant\u2019s favor in view of the whole person analysis.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-05110 at n 7\n(App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004); ISCR Case No. 99-0542 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2003).   In this case, the\nJudge\u2019s whole-person analysis states in pertinent part: \u201cApplicant is a young adult with significant\n\n4\nresponsibility in his two jobs and for his family.  He is acting responsibly to make certain that he\nprovides for their support.  He was offered a real estate package that was too good to be true and it\nturned out that it wasn\u2019t.  He was completely inexperienced in real estate investment and was taken\nin by the scheme [which the Judge previously described as fraudulent] in the belief that he could be\na property owner with rental income to pay the mortgages from vary little money invested.  However,\nhe has taken some steps to resolve the delinquent debts with the mortgage holder and, hopefully, will\ncontinue to do so.\u201d   Decision at 7.  These comments are supported by the Judge\u2019s findings of fact\nand by the record.  However, they do not support the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion to deny Applicant\na clearance, in light of record evidence that his debts originated from an act of fraud perpetrated\nagainst him, the fact that he has taken steps to resolve his debts, and the fact that the record discloses\nno other debt attributable to him.  The Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is not sustainable.\nThe Board  remands the case for a new decision consistent with this discussion.      \n  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned; Michael Y.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 18,\n2006. On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 29, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May \n22, 2008. I received the case assignment on May 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 6, 2008, for a hearing on June 17, 2008. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered five exhibits (Exhs 1-5) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted four exhibits (Exhs. A-D)\nwhich were admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 1, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\nthe record open until July 17, 2008, to submit additional evidence. A set of documents\n(Exhs. E-Q) was received three days after the conclusion of the hearing. The\ndocuments were admitted in evidence without objection.\nProcedural Rulings\nNotice\nThe hearing notice was dated less than 15 days before the hearing date. I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated\nhe was ready to proceed (Tr. 8).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a government contractor working as an\noperations commander of a security service company since August 2005. He\nsupervises the facility security personnel at a small Navy base. He holds a second job\nas a police officer for a municipality. \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the four allegations in the SOR relating to\napproximately $139,000 in delinquent debts arising from his purchase of three rental\nproperties in June 2005. He paid $238,000 for one and $170,000 for each of the other\ntwo for a total of $578,000. He bought each property with a $1,000 investment for each. \nIn addition, the seller also paid in a total of $10,000 to facilitate the purchases of\nall three properties. The seller did not expect to be re-paid nor did he take a second\nmortgage on the properties. Apparently the profit to him came from the mortgage\ncompany that sold the mortgages to another company. This was a practice followed by\nother sellers involved in similar schemes (Exh. O, p. 2).\nApplicant and seven or more other persons were the victims of a scam\nperpetrated by the person who sold the properties to him and the others who were\ninvolved in the operation. The properties were all over-valued by appraisers who were\nworking with the mortgage company and the seller. The mortgages with inflated values\n\n3\nwere sold to other companies leaving Applicant and others with mortgages to pay on\nproperties worth much less than the mortgages for which they were responsible. \nThe tenants in the three properties were receiving Section 8 low-income rental\npayments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) The rents of\n$1,500 per month for all three properties were paid to Applicant by HUD (Tr. 31). The\nfunds were then sent each month to the mortgagor as mortgage payments for six\nmonths until January 2006. At that time the entire complex of which these two lower\npriced properties were a part was condemned for heating and health violations. The\nresult was there was insufficient rental income to pay the mortgages. Applicant stopped\nmaking payments and the properties were foreclosed in 2006. All three were later sold\nto be rehabilitated at a much lower price than what Applicant and other purchasers had\npaid. It is the difference in the sales price less the mortgage payments made by\nApplicant and the remaining amount of the mortgage that constitutes the debts that are\nthe basis of the allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.,1.b., and 1.c.).\nWhen Applicant became fully aware of what had happened with the appraisals,\nhe wrote a letter in April 2006 to the attorney general of the state where the transactions\ntook place. Copies of the letter were sent to other state officials responsible for\nregulating real estate and appraisals urging that action by taken against the perpetrators\nof the scheme (Exh. C). No responses were received by Applicant from any of the\nofficials. At the time of the hearing in this matter, Applicant had obtained very little\ninformation and documentation in the two years since he concluded that he had been a\nvictim of fraud. The record was held open for 30 days for additional submissions. He\nwas urged by me to make contact with prosecutors and others involved in related\nmatters. Most of the material cited herein was provided during that period. \nThe person who sold the properties to Applicant was found with a single bullet\nwound to the head in 2006. Authorities determined that he either was murdered or\ncommitted suicide. The mortgage company and the appraiser are out of business. One\nperson, an employee of the mortgage company that initially held Applicant\u2019s mortgage,\nhas pled guilty to a fraudulent transaction, and been sentenced in federal court. \nThe scheme has been the subject of press commentary involving several similar\noperations in at least three southern states. Applicant and the other victims, who\ndescribe their involvement in the record (Exhs. G and H), have engaged counsel in their\nstate (Exh. F) to obtain relief on their credit reports (Exhs. J and K) and take action\nagainst the perpetrators. No definitive results have been forthcoming since the seller,\nthe mortgage company, and the appraisers involved have either closed their operations\nor are deceased. \nApplicant has been in contact with the company that purchased the mortgage\nfrom the original mortgagor in an effort to work out a payment program or settle the\nmatter. However, the company has insisted on full payment of all three debts (Tr. 14).\n\n4\nApplicant is divorced and has a five-year-old son for whom he is responsible. He\nserved for three years as an enlisted person in the Army between 1993 and 1996. He\nalso served briefly as an officer in the Army National Guard in 2001 and 2002 (Exh. 1). \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his principal employment is approximately\n$65,000. For his second job he is paid approximately $18,000 per annum. He is highly\nregarded by his employer for his work (Exhs. A and B). He has savings of approximately\n$30,000 (Exh. D). He has no other financial difficulties. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n5\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and\nhas been unwilling to make payments to the purchaser of his mortgages for several\nyears since he believed he had been the victim of a fraudulent scheme. Thus, the\nevidence clearly raises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nWhile the initial down payment by Applicant of only $1,000 and the fact that the\nseller was willing to pay $10,000 more to facilitate the scheme should have raised red\nflags to him, he had no specific reason to believe that the events would turn out as they\nhave. From information provided about other investors in similar schemes facilitated by\nthe operators, many others have been taken in by this and similar operations (Exhs O\nand P). It is only one piece of the mortgage crisis we now see across the country.\nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the\nsecurity concern also may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant voluntarily\nentered into the transaction to purchase the properties to make an investment. There\nwas no guarantee that rents would continue to be paid under the Section 8 program or\nany by any other tenant. When the investment did not develop as planned, he ceased\n\n6\nmaking the payments. When he concluded that he had been defrauded, he wrote a letter\nand did very little to follow up on the matter until the hearing in this proceeding. The\nmitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nI conclude that Applicant has established the basis and modus operandi of the\nfraud committed on him, others similarly situated, and on the purchasers of the inflated\nvalue mortgages. He made payments on the mortgages up to the time the properties\nwere foreclosed or condemned. One debt has been charged off (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). He does\nnot have the financial ability to pay the full amount of the mortgage deficiencies for which\nhe has been assessed. Recently, he has taken steps to have the debts removed from his\ncredit records. He has had discussions with the current holder of the mortgage in an\neffort to compromise the amount of the debt or be relieved of it. No results have been\nachieved. He continues to be legally responsible for the debts. While I believe there were\nfraudulent transactions involved in this scheme, Applicant has not been sufficiently\ndiligent in pursuing the problem until recently. The mitigating condition is not applicable.\nIt is premature to grant a security clearance. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \nApplicant is a young adult with significant responsibility in his two jobs and for his\nfamily. He is acting responsibly to make certain that he provides for their support. He\n\n7\nwas offered a real estate package that was too good to be true and it turned out that it\nwasn\u2019t. He was completely inexperienced in real estate investment and was taken in by\nthe scheme in the belief that he could be a property owner with rental income to pay the\nmortgages from very little money invested. However, he has taken some steps to resolve\nthe delinquent debts with the mortgage holder and, hopefully, will continue to do so. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from these financial\nconsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied. \n_______________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

He holds a second job as a police officer for a municipality. 3 In his Answer, Applicant admitted the four allegations in the SOR relating to approximately $139,000 in delinquent debts arising from his purchase of three rental properties in June 2005. He paid $238,000 for one and $170,000 for each of the other two for a total of $578,000. He bought each property with a $1,000 investment for each. In addition, the seller also paid a total of $10,000 to facilitate the purchases of all three properties. The seller did not expect to be re-paid nor did he take a second mortgage on the properties. Apparently the profit to him came from the mortgage company that sold the mortgages to another company. This was a practice followed by other sellers involved in similar schemes (Exh. O, p. 2).

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nRemand Decision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 18,\n2006. On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 29, 2008 and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May\n22, 2008. I received the case assignment on May 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 6, 2008, for a hearing on June 17, 2008. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered five exhibits (Exhs 1-5) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted four exhibits (Exhs. A-D)\nthat were admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr1) on July 1, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the\nrecord open until July 17, 2008, to submit additional evidence. A set of documents\n(Exhs. E-Q) was received three days after the conclusion of the hearing. The\ndocuments were admitted in evidence without objection. I issued a decision denying him\na security clearance on August 26, 2008. \nIn a letter dated October 1, 2008, Applicant, through his counsel, submitted new\nevidence to me in support of his case. Under DOHA rules of procedure, I could not\nconsider the evidence since I had issued a decision in the case a month earlier.\nApplicant filed an appeal with the DOHA Appeal Board. The Board had vacated a\ndefault on an earlier appeal, and set a date for re-filing the appeal that was timely filed.\nThe Board considered the appeal, and issued it\u2019s decision on December 15, 2008. The\nBoard noted that, it, too, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. could not consider the new\nevidence. However, the Board remanded the matter to me concluding that my denial of\na security clearance was not sustainable for failure to properly evaluate the case under\nthe whole person analysis. \nIn following the guidance provided by the Board, I re-opened the hearing by\nvideo teleconference on January 12, 2009. Applicant offered five additional documents\n(Exhs. R-V) in evidence and testified on his own behalf. The documents were accepted\nin evidence without objection. The transcript of the re-opened hearing was received on\nJanuary 26, 2009. \nProcedural Rulings\nThe hearing notice was dated less than 15 days before the hearing date. I\nadvised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before\nthe hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated\nhe was ready to proceed (Tr1. 8).\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a government contractor working as an\noperations commander of a security service company since August 2005. He\nsupervises the facility security personnel at a small Navy base. He holds a second job\nas a police officer for a municipality. \n\n3\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the four allegations in the SOR relating to\napproximately $139,000 in delinquent debts arising from his purchase of three rental\nproperties in June 2005. He paid $238,000 for one and $170,000 for each of the other\ntwo for a total of $578,000. He bought each property with a $1,000 investment for each. \nIn addition, the seller also paid a total of $10,000 to facilitate the purchases of all\nthree properties. The seller did not expect to be re-paid nor did he take a second\nmortgage on the properties. Apparently the profit to him came from the mortgage\ncompany that sold the mortgages to another company. This was a practice followed by\nother sellers involved in similar schemes (Exh. O, p. 2).\nApplicant and at least seven or other persons were the victims of a scam\nperpetrated by the person who sold the properties to him and the others who were\ninvolved in the operation. The properties were all over-valued by appraisers who were\nworking with the mortgage company and the seller. The mortgages with inflated values\nwere sold to other companies leaving Applicant and others with mortgages to pay on\nproperties worth much less than the mortgages for which they were responsible. \nThe tenants in the three properties were receiving low-income rental payments\nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) The rents of $1,500\nper month for all three properties were paid to Applicant by HUD (Tr. 31). The funds\nwere then sent each month to the mortgagor as mortgage payments for six months until\nJanuary 2006. At that time the entire complex of which the two lower priced properties\nwere a part was condemned. As a result, there was insufficient rental income to make\npayments on the mortgages. When Applicant stopped making payments, the properties\nwere foreclosed in 2006. All three were later sold to be rehabilitated at much lower\nprices than what Applicant and other purchasers had paid. It is the difference in the\nsales price less the mortgage payments made by Applicant, and the remaining amount\nof the mortgage that constitutes the delinquent debts that are the basis of the\nallegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.,1.b., and 1.c.).\nWhen Applicant became fully aware of what had happened with the appraisals,\nhe wrote a letter in April 2006 to the attorney general of the state where the transactions\ntook place. Copies of the letter were sent to other state officials responsible for\nregulating real estate and appraisals urging that action taken against the perpetrators of\nthe scheme (Exh. C). No responses were received by Applicant from any of the officials.\nAt the time of the hearing in this matter, Applicant had obtained very little information\nand documentation in the two years since he concluded that he had been a victim of\nfraud. The record was held open for 30 days for additional submissions. I encouraged\nhim to make contact with prosecutors and others involved in related matters. Most of the\ncited material in my first decision was submitted post-hearing. The additional material\nsubmitted in the re-opened hearing also has been cited in this opinion. \nThe events following the transactions concerning the persons involved indicates\nthat the person who sold the properties to Applicant was found with a single bullet\nwound to the head in 2006. Authorities determined that he either was murdered or\n\n4\ncommitted suicide. The mortgage company and the appraiser were soon thereafter out\nof business. One person, an employee of the mortgage company that initially held\nApplicant\u2019s mortgage, has pled guilty to a fraudulent transaction, and has been\nsentenced in federal court. \nThe scheme has been the subject of press commentary involving several similar\noperations in at least three southern states. Applicant and the other victims, who\ndescribe their involvement in the record (Exhs. G and H), have engaged counsel in their\nstate (Exh. F) to obtain relief on their credit reports (Exhs. J and K) and take action\nagainst the perpetrators. No definitive results have been forthcoming since the seller,\nthe mortgage company, and the appraisers involved have either closed their operations\nor are deceased. \nApplicant has been in contact with the company that purchased the mortgage\nfrom the original mortgagor in an effort to work out a payment program or settle the\nmatter. However, the company insisted on full payment of all three debts at the time of\nthe initial hearing (Tr1. 14). However, at the re-opened hearing, he offered evidence that\nthe debts on the SOR for two properties were no longer on his credit report (Exh. R,\np.4), and that he had reason to believe based on advice he received from the first\nholder that the mortgages had been sold to another company that decided not to pursue\ncollection. The third property still showed a delinquent debt listed as an amount due of\n$14,000 on a total debt of $59,000. Another document in the record from the original\nmortgagor shows lower figures (Exh. V). He has been in contact with the mortgagor and\nhas made a conscientious effort to settle or pay the outstanding amount (Exhs. T. U and\nV). So far, this has not been successful but he continues to pursue resolution of the\nmatter. He insists that the debt will be resolved if it is not forgiven or dropped as the\nothers have been. \nApplicant is divorced and has a five-year-old son for whom he is responsible. He\nserved as an enlisted person in the Army between 1993 and 1996. He also served\nbriefly as an officer in the Army National Guard in 2001 and 2002 (Exh. 1). \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his principal employment is approximately\n$65,000. For his second job he is paid approximately $18,000 per annum. He is highly\nregarded by his employer for his work (Exhs. A and B). He has savings of approximately\n$30,000 (Exh. D) although over half of that amount is in an education account for his\nson. He has no other financial difficulties and is current with all his other accounts. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and\nhas been unwilling to make payments to the purchaser of his mortgages for several\nyears since he believed he had been the victim of a fraudulent scheme.

Applicant entered into the\ntransaction to purchase the properties as long term investments. There was no\nguarantee that rents would continue to be paid. When the investments did not develop\nas planned, he ceased making the mortgage payments. When he concluded that he had\nbeen defrauded, he wrote a letter to the authorities which produced no results. However\nit is now known that several other persons were victimized by the same operators and\nthat criminal investigations are being pursued by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office. This\nmitigating condition is applicable. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. While he may have a legal obligation\nto pay the debts, he has provided evidence of a reasonable basis for disputing the debts\nand has taken, and continues to take, action to resolve the issues. This mitigating\ncondition is also applicable. \nI conclude that Applicant has established the facts and modus operandi of the\nfraud committed on him, others similarly situated, and on the purchasers of the inflated\nvalue mortgages. He made payments on the mortgages up to the time the properties\n\n7\nwere foreclosed or condemned. One debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) was charged off at the time of the\nfirst hearing, and now a second has been charged off. He continues to work on the third.\nHe does not have the financial ability to pay the full amount of the mortgage deficiencies\nfor which he has been assessed but has the ability to make payments on the debt as a\nreasonable lump sum payment.\nApplicant has taken steps to have the debts removed from his credit reports. He\nhas had discussions with the original holder of the mortgage in an effort to compromise\nthe amount of the debt or be relieved of it. He is in contact with purchaser of the\nmortgage. While, he continues to be legally responsible for the debts he is taking steps\nto resolve the situation. While there were fraudulent transactions involved in this scheme,\nApplicant was not as diligent in pursuing the problem as he might have been until the\nSOR was issued. However, he has taken adequate steps since that time to resolve the\nfinancial issues raised by the government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \nApplicant is a mature adult with significant responsibility in his two jobs and for his\nminor child. He is acting responsibly to make certain that he provides for his family. He\nhas not had any other financial problems and is not incurring any further financial\ndelinquencies. He was offered a real estate package that was too good to be true and it\nturned out that it wasn\u2019t. He was completely inexperienced in real estate investment and\nwas taken in by the scheme in the belief that he could be a property owner with rental\nincome to pay the mortgages from very little money invested. While his actions may have\nbeen naive, he did not act recklessly. He has taken steps to resolve the delinquent debts\n\n8\nwith the mortgage holder with some success. He has learned his lesson about investing\nin matters about which he knows little (TR2 p. 28). \nThe evidence adduced at the second hearing convinces me that based on an\nanalysis of the whole person that he has mitigated the security concerns arising from\nthese financial considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For  Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted.\nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 11, 2006, he submitted a Security \nClearance Application (SF 86). On March 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nJune 30, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 20, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On May 8, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to \nme. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 7, 2008, and the case was heard on May \n30, 2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through H \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 11, \n2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and single. He earned a Bachelor of Science in \nAccounting and a Bachelor of Science in Finance. In January 1994, he enlisted in the \nU.S. Air Force and served until August 2002 when he received an honorable discharge. \nHe was a Sergeant (E-4) when he was discharged. While in the Air Force, he had a Top \nSecret clearance and access to classified information as a computer specialist. He \ncomes from a family with a history of military service. His father was in the Marine Corps \nfor 20 years, one of his four brothers recently retired from the Air Force, and another \nbrother is in the Air Force reserves. (Tr. 50). \n \n \nAfter his discharge from the Air Force in 2002, Applicant worked for a federal \ncontractor until October 2004. He was a communications center operator with access to \na classified internet, essentially performing the same duties he did when on active duty. \nIn November 2004, he began a position with his current employer, a defense contractor. \nFrom October 2005 to December 2006, he held a second full-time computer position, \nworking for another defense contractor. (Tr. 21-22, 45, 57). \n  \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s 14-year career with the government, he has held a security \nclearance. In December 1994, he was granted a Top Secret security clearance, and in \nApril 2001, he was granted access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In \n2006, he received a work-related polygraph. (Tr. 24). There is no evidence of any \nincidents indicating breaches of security policies or other violations. \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant placed a personal advertisement on the internet. He \nsubsequently met a woman with whom he had a long-distance internet relationship until \nFebruary 2008. (Tr. 27-28). He never met her in person and in 2002, she wanted to \nbecome engaged and he agreed. (Tr. 40). Over the course of the years, he asked to \nvisit her on occasion, but she refused. They interacted by daily email and phone calls, \nbut never met in person. He considered her to be his friend. (Tr. 27). He \u201cloved her,\u201d but \nsometimes was distressed with the long distant relationship. (Tr. 46). He told his friends \nabout the relationship and they advised him to terminate it. At times, he considered the \npossibility that the situation was a \u201cscam,\u201d but believed she was a good person. (Tr. 41-\n42).   \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nAfter communicating for about six months, the woman began asking Applicant for \nmoney. From 2001 until October 2005, Applicant sent her $500-$800 per month. (Tr. \n37). After he began working two jobs in October 2005, he earned $132,000 annually, \nand sent her $2,000 per month. (Tr. 55). He continued depositing that amount into her \nbank account until December 2006 when he left his second job. Thereafter, he sent her \nwhat he could afford. (Tr. 31). Applicant asserted that he could afford to give her money \nand never experienced financial problems as a result of doing so. He listed her as a \ndependent on his 2005 income tax return because she did not work and he was her \nsole source of income. He acknowledged that it was a mistake to do that. (Tr. 30).  The \nlast time he sent her money was in January 2008. (Tr. 44). \n \n \nApplicant lost his Top Secret clearance and access to SCI as a result of the \nrelationship. In November 2006, the National Security Agency denied Applicant access \nto sensitive compartmented information (SCI), noting in its Clearance Decision \nStatement that: \u201c[Applicant] was being considered for access to some of the most \nsensitive and perishable information in the U.S. government. Yet his conduct with [the \nwoman] raises considerable doubt relative to his character, judgment, discretion, \ntrustworthiness and reliability.\u201d (GE 5). As a result, he left his second job at the end of \nDecember 2006 or early January 2007. (Tr. 45). The following year, in January 2008, he \nlost his primary position after his Top Secret clearance was revoked, pending the \noutcome of this proceeding. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that the reason he terminated the relationship in February \n2008 was because he lost his job. (Tr. 34-35). He realizes that he may lose his job \npermanently as a result of his involvement with the woman. He insisted that he never \ndid anything to jeopardize classified information while in the relationship. (Tr. 33). He \ntold the woman that he worked for the government, but not the nature of his work.  \n \n \nWhile testifying, Applicant expressed great sadness and grief over the loss of his \nrelationship. He is currently unemployed and attending college. (Tr. 23). In addition to \nthe stress of being without a job, he came to realize that he \u201cneeded to move on\u201d with \nhis life. (Tr. 29).  He has not sought any form of counseling or grief therapy to assist him \nin managing his disappointment and understanding the underlying dynamics of the long-\ndistance relationship. He believes he is \u201cfine.\u201d (Tr. 48). He is attempting to rebuild his \nlife. (Tr. 52). \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from his most current supervisor, \nhis former manager from his second job, and a program director with whom Applicant \nworked from August 2002 to October 2004. All of them consider Applicant to be \nprofessional, competent and ethical.  (AE A).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to personal \nconduct:  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any \nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern, two of \nwhich may be specifically disqualifying in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information; and, \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \nIn November 2006, Applicant lost access to SCI and his second job. After an \ninvestigation the National Security Agency determined that he did not meet the \nstandards for access to SCI because of his long-term relationship with a woman he \nnever met and whom he intended to remain in contact. Despite that decision and notice \nthat the Government had security concerns about him, Applicant stayed in the \nrelationship and continued to send money to her for the next year, raising further \nquestions about his judgment in personal matters. Based on that evidence, the \nGovernment raised 16(d). Although Applicant disclosed his long-term, long-distance \ninternet relationship to his family, friends, and supervisors, he maintained the \nrelationship after he lost his second job. Because his unorthodox relationship could be \nconstrued as embarrassing, it could also affect his standing in the community and \nprovide an opportunity for exploitation in the future. The Government established 16(e).    \nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to \nprovide evidence to rebut or mitigate it.  AG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns: The following three have potential applicability to the facts:  \n (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \nApplicant had a relationship with someone he never meet, but chose to \nsupport. His decision to engage in questionable behavior for seven years and \nunder such circumstances is not minor and raises questions about his judgment. \nHence, 17(c) does not apply. Although he acknowledges his behavior and the \nproblems it presented, he did not obtain counseling or demonstrate that he has \ntaken steps to understand or alleviate the circumstances that underlie seven \nyears of exercising questionable judgment. Without such evidence, similar \nbehaviors may recur and 17(d) is not applicable. Applicant asserted that he \nterminated his long-distance relationship three months before the hearing. That \nevidence, alone, is not sufficient to warrant the full application of 17(e) in view of \nthe length of time he participated in the relationship.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the many positive aspects \nin Applicant\u2019s life. He is a 39-year-old man, who honorably served his country for eight \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nyears in the Air Force, during which time he held a Top-Secret clearance. After leaving \nmilitary service, he began employment with a federal contractor and continued \nsuccessfully supporting the Government, while maintaining a Top Secret security \nclearance and access to SCI for several more years. He is intelligent, honest and \nhardworking; he has maintained two important full-time positions for more than a year.   \n \nI also considered a seven-year \u201cblind spot\u201d in Applicant\u2019s life. From 2001 to 2008, \nhe maintained a relationship with a woman whom he considered to be his fianc\u00e9e, but \nnever met. He provided her substantial financial support and believed he was legally \nauthorized to claim her as a tax exemption. He desired a conventional marriage, but she \ndeterred him with serial excuses for not meeting him. Even after this relationship cost \nhim his second job, he persisted in communicating and sending her money for another \nyear. Unfortunately, the relationship demonstrates an on-going pattern of poor judgment \nin matters of personal significance. In spite of the anguish that this situation has brought \nto his life, he offered limited insight into his behavior and adamantly refused \nprofessional counseling, which could provide understanding of the relationship and \nbring meaningful closure. Without such assistance, similar incidents could arise and \ncreate further security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance at this time. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact. Amendment of SOR After both sides had presented their evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding an allegation that Applicant\u2019s three brothers-in-law, one sister-in-law, and their spouses are citizens and residents of Thailand (Tr. 94). I explained to Applicant the authority for amending the SOR and the implications for him, and I informed him I would give him additional time to submit additional evidence regarding the additional allegation in the SOR. He did not object to the amendment, and I granted the motion to amend the SOR (Tr. 95-99). He timely submitted additional evidence, as noted above in the Statement of the Case. Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and 1.g. He partially admitted \u00b6 1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant was born in Taiwan in October 1967. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in Taiwan, and then he was drafted and performed mandatory military service in the Taiwanese military from 1989 to 1991.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), \nraised by Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan and Thailand. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 8, 2006. On \nApril 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 5, 2008; answered it on May \n12; 2008; and requested an administrative determination without a hearing. DOHA \nreceived the request on May 15, 2008. Department Counsel requested a hearing on \nJune 2, 2008 (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I), and was ready to proceed on June 12, 2008. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July \n28, 2008, scheduling the hearing for August 19, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through W, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to \nkeep the record open until September 2, 2008, to submit additional documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AE X through CC, and they were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 27, 2008. The record closed on \nSeptember 2, 2008. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Taiwan and Thailand (HX II). I took administrative notice as requested, without \nobjection from Applicant (Tr. 28). The facts administratively noticed are set out below in \nmy findings of fact. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nAfter both sides had presented their evidence, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR by adding an allegation that Applicant\u2019s three brothers-in-law, one \nsister-in-law, and their spouses are citizens and residents of Thailand (Tr. 94). I \nexplained to Applicant the authority for amending the SOR and the implications for him, \nand I informed him I would give him additional time to submit additional evidence \nregarding the additional allegation in the SOR. He did not object to the amendment, and \nI granted the motion to amend the SOR (Tr. 95-99). He timely submitted additional \nevidence, as noted above in the Statement of the Case. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e \nand 1.g. He partially admitted \u00b6 1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Taiwan in October 1967. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin Taiwan, and then he was drafted and performed mandatory military service in the \nTaiwanese military from 1989 to 1991. After he was discharged, he came to the U.S. He \nlived for one year with his sister and brother-in-law, improving his English and preparing \nfor graduate school. He obtained a master\u2019s degree in physics in June 1994 (AX G; Tr. \n15) and a second master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in December 1998 (AX H \nand I). He enrolled in a doctoral program (AX J and K), but he did not complete it. He \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhas authored several scholarly articles and participated in numerous seminars and \nconferences on electronic signal processing (AX L and M).  \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in October 1997. He has been employed as a \nsenior engineer for a government contractor since October 2006 (AX A). He has an \ninterim clearance, but he has never held a final security clearance (Tr. 15-16). \n \n \nApplicant met his wife while he was obtaining his first master\u2019s degree, and they \nwere married in June 1998 (Tr. 57; AX C). They have two children who are U.S. \ncitizens. His wife was born in Thailand in March 1968 (AX AA and BB). She obtained \nher bachelor\u2019s degree in Thailand, came to the U.S. in 1992, obtained a doctorate in \nchemistry, and became a U.S. citizen in June 2004. She holds dual citizenship by virtue \nof her birth in Thailand.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother is deceased, and her father is a citizen and resident of \nThailand who owned a jewelry shop but is now retired (Tr. 81). She has four married \nsiblings, three brothers who own and operate a small jewelry shop (AX CC), and a sister \nwho is a housewife (AX Z). All her family members live in Bangkok (GX 2 at 9). She \nmaintains contact with her family in Thailand, and she visited them for approximately \nthree months from December 2002 to February 2003 and again from September to \nDecember 2004 (AX N). Her younger sister and her spouse visited Applicant and his \nwife in the U.S. in August 2006, when her sister\u2019s spouse received his M.B.A. degree \nfrom a U.S. university (Tr. 84). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in China, left China around 1949, and is a citizen and \nresident of Taiwan. He retired from a position in the Taiwan tax department and lives in \na nursing home (Tr. 61). Based on Applicant\u2019s description, it appears his father was an \nauditor or low-level supervisor (Tr. 78). Applicant telephones his father about every \nother week (Tr. 86).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Taiwan. She has Alzheimer\u2019s disease and lives \nin a nursing home in the U.S. Applicant cannot communicate with her because of her \nmental condition (Tr. 86).  \n \nApplicant has four living siblings: a sister who is a citizen and resident of the \nU.S.; a sister who is a citizen of the U.S., married to a U.S. citizen, and teaches \nMandarin in a Christian school in Hong Kong (AX N and O); a sister who is a citizen and \nresident of Australia; and a brother who became a Canadian citizen in May 2001, then \nbecame a U.S. citizen in July 2008, and resides in the U.S. (Tr. 62). \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Taiwan in December 2000, September 2004, and \nDecember 2004; and he traveled to Thailand in December 2002 and February 2003. All \ntravel was to visit his father or his wife\u2019s family, sometimes combining business travel \nwith family visits (AX Q through W). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family in Taiwan and none of his wife\u2019s family in Thailand are \npolitically connected or politically active. Applicant\u2019s father is the only member of either \nfamily who was a government employee.  \n \n \nApplicant has been an active member of his church for more than 13 years. \nApplicant\u2019s minister describes him as a \u201csincere, responsible, and faithful\u201d member of \nthe church (AX B). He purchased a home in 2007, after renting since 1992 (AX D, E, \nand F). He has filed U.S. income tax returns every year since 1992 (AX P). He believes \nevery U.S. citizen has an obligation to vote, and he has voted in every U.S. presidential \nelection (Tr. 92). \n \nI have taken administrative notice that Taiwan is a multi-party democracy, \nestablished as a separate, independent government by refugees from mainland China \nin 1949. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) does not recognize Taiwan\u2019s \nindependence and insists there is only one China. The U.S. recognized Taiwan as an \nindependent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized the PRC \ngovernment as the sole legal government of China. Taiwan has developed a strong \neconomy and has significant economic contacts with the PRC, but it also maintains a \nlarge military establishment to protect itself from the PRC. Commercial ties between the \nU.S. and Taiwan have expanded since 1979. For many years, Taiwan has been an \nactive collector of U.S. economic intelligence, and there have been numerous instances \nof efforts to export sensitive, dual-use U.S. technology to Taiwan. \n \n \nI have also taken administrative notice that Thailand is a constitutional monarchy. \nIn September 2006, military leaders overthrew the democratically elected government, \nabolished Parliament, declared martial law, and issued decrees limiting free speech, \nfree press, and freedom of assembly. After the coup, the U.S. suspended foreign aid, \nmilitary training, and peace-keeping programs with Thailand. Those programs were \nresumed after a democratically-elected government was elected in December 2007 and \ntook office. Thailand has an open-market economy with considerable foreign investment \nand an increasingly diversified manufacturing sector, but about 40% of Thailand\u2019s labor \nforce is agricultural. The U.S. is Thailand\u2019s largest export market and third largest \nsupplier. The U.S. and the new government of Thailand have resumed the good \nrelations that existed before the coup. Thailand\u2019s current foreign policy emphasizes a \nclose security relationship with the U.S. Before and after the coup, there were reported \ninstances of disappearance, torture, and arbitrary arrest and detention. There has been \nincreased terrorism and politically motivated violence, particularly in the far south of \nThailand. The incidents are focused primarily on Thai government interests, but have \ntargeted tourist areas. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges Applicant\u2019s father and mother are citizens of \nTaiwan and his father resides in Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.b); his spouse is a dual \ncitizen of Taiwan and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.c); his father-in-law, three brothers-in-law, one \nsister-in-law, and their spouses are citizens and residents of Thailand (SOR \u00b6 1.d and \n1.h); he served in the Taiwanese military from 1989 to 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he \ntraveled to Taiwan in September 2004, December 2004, December 2003, and \nDecember 2000, and to Thailand in February 2003 and December 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.f and \n1.g). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s military service was mandatory, and it occurred before he became a \nU.S. citizen. As such, it raises no security concerns. See AG \u00b6 11(c) (Under Guideline \n\n \n7 \n \n \nC, an exercise of an obligation of foreign citizenship can be mitigated if it occurred \nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreign travel, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, was to visit family \nmembers and in connection with his employment. To the extent that his travel was a \nmanifestation of his family ties, it has no independent security significance. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-26978 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2005). \n \n \nThree disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  \nFirst, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Third, a security \nconcern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters with a person or \npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). When family \nmembers are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as \nwell as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \n \nTaiwan is an active practitioner of economic espionage directed at the U.S., but \nthere is no evidence Taiwan abuses its citizens to gather intelligence. Applicant\u2019s father \nwas a low-level bureaucrat in the Taiwanese government, not involved in policy-making, \nmilitary affairs, or intelligence. His father has never been involved in the high-technology \narena in which Applicant works. There is no evidence in the record that Thailand targets \nthe U.S. for military or economic espionage, but the recent upheavals in government \nand the presence of insurgents and anti-government terrorists are sufficient to raise the \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d encompassed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d). Considering the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family ties, I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d) are raised. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse holds dual U.S.-Thai citizenship, and her father, siblings, and \ntheir spouses are citizens and residents of Thailand. I conclude the potential conflict of \ninterest encompassed in AG \u00b6 7(b) is raised. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s mother resides in the U.S. and is mentally incompetent, \nmaking it very difficult to influence or exploit her, but Applicant is close to his father, and \nhis spouse is close to her father and siblings. Taiwan conducts economic intelligence \nagainst the U.S. Thailand suffers from politically-motivated terrorism and occasional \nabuses by security forces, but its newly-elected democratic government is friendly to the \nU.S. Applicant\u2019s in-laws in Thailand are not politically active, and they live in Bangkok, \nnot in the far south of Thailand where the violence is centered. Although the likelihood \nof a conflict of interest is not great, the evidence falls short of showing it is \u201cunlikely.\u201d \nAccordingly, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). \nApplicant left Taiwan many years ago and has no emotional or political ties to the \ngovernment of Taiwan. His ties to his parents, and his spouse\u2019s ties to her family are not \n\u201cminimal,\u201d but Applicant has developed deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S. He has lived, studied, and worked in the U.S. since about 1992, and \nhe has been a U.S. citizen since 1997. He met his spouse in the U.S., and she has \nbeen a U.S. citizen since 2004. He has two small children who are citizens of the U.S. \nand whose future is in the U.S. Three of his four siblings are citizens of the U.S., and \ntwo of them reside in the U.S. His ailing mother resides in the U.S. with one of his \nsiblings. His only family member residing in Taiwan is his father. He has been an active \nmember of his church for more than 13 years. All of his financial assets are in the U.S. I \nam satisfied that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the interests \nof the U.S. Therefore, I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. I incorporate \nmy comments above under Guideline B in my whole person analysis. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult. He was meticulously prepared, \narticulate, candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He is proud of his work and fully \ncommitted to being a good citizen of the U.S. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on \nforeign influence. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

He is a 30-year-old graphic artist employed by a defense contractor since July 2006. He has not previously held a security clearance. Applicant has an extensive history of criminal conduct dating back to 1996. Most of his criminal conduct occurred in 1996, the year he turned 18 years old, and all the crimes had negative implications for his honesty and trustworthiness. He was arrested in April 1996 for felony unauthorized use of a vehicle. In May 1996, he was arrested for shoplifting/ theft under $300. The charge was placed on the stet docket. In June 1996, he was again arrested for theft under $300, found guilty, and fined. In November 1996, he was arrested for petty larceny, found guilty, and served 50-days\u2019 jail time of the 18 months he was awarded. In December 1996, he was charged with burglary/forced entry, and ultimately incarcerated until May 1999. Applicant attributed his misconduct in 1996 to his extensive drug and alcohol abuse during that time in his life, brought on by his troubled childhood and the ensuing depression. When he was incarcerated between 1997 and 1999, he sought help through county-run drug and alcohol counseling programs.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 9 June 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 21 August 2008, and requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 10 February 2009. The record in this\ncase closed 31 December 2008, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File\nof Relevant Material (FORM) was due. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. DOHA\nassigned the case to me 10 February 2009.\nMarch 16, 2009\n\nAnd the government did not allege any security concerns under drugs or alcohol. I mention the drug and\n2\nalcohol history only as necessary background for Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate those\nadmissions as findings of fact. He is a 30-year-old graphic artist employed by a defense\ncontractor since July 2006. He has not previously held a  security clearance.\nApplicant has an extensive history of criminal conduct dating back to 1996. Most\nof his criminal conduct occurred in 1996, the year he turned 18 years old, and all the\ncrimes had negative implications for his honesty and trustworthiness. He was arrested\nin April 1996 for felony unauthorized use of a vehicle. In May 1996, he was arrested for\nshoplifting/ theft under $300. The charge was placed on the stet docket. In June 1996,\nhe was again arrested for theft under $300, found guilty, and fined. In November 1996,\nhe was arrested for petty larceny, found guilty, and served 50-days\u2019 jail time of the 18\nmonths he was awarded. In December 1996, he was charged with burglary/forced\nentry, and ultimately incarcerated until May 1999.\nApplicant attributed his misconduct in 1996 to his extensive drug and alcohol\nabuse during that time in his life, brought on by his troubled childhood and the ensuing\ndepression. When he was incarcerated between 1997 and 1999, he sought help\nthrough county-run drug and alcohol counseling programs. He claims no further drug\nand alcohol abuse since he completed those programs.2\nIn May 2001, Applicant was arrested on felony charges of scheme/theft over\n$500 and 14 counts of theft over $500 from his employer of nine months, a well-known\ndirect seller of frozen food products to individual homeowners. A driver for the company,\nhe had been caught skimming money from his daily sales over a period of time. At the\ntime, Applicant had experienced financial problems when his live-in girlfriend left her job\nand he was unable to keep up with their household expenses on his earnings alone.\nThe company fired him.\nApplicant eventually pled guilty to the scheme/theft charge and the remaining\ncharges were nolle prossed. He was awarded 18 months imprisonment, three years\u2019\nsupervised probation, and indefinite probation until he made the $11,000 court-ordered\nrestitution to his employer. Applicant was released from prison in May 2002, and\ncompleted the terms of his probation in July 2007. \nApplicant was also arrested for failure to appear in April 2005. However, police\nrecords contain no information regarding the underlying charge, or  the disposition. That\ntends to confirm Applicant\u2019s claim that the arrest was a mistake based on incorrect\ninformation obtained by the police.   \nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in June 2007 (Item 4), he failed\nto disclose that he had been fired from his driving job by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 22\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\n(adverse employment terminations). He misrepresented the date of his felony arrest in\nquestion 23 (police record\u2014felonies) by placing it in May 1999 instead of May 2001. \nApplicant admits the omissions, but denies any intent to deceive. He claims he\nforgot the correct date of his felony arrest, and did not intend to conceal his adverse\ntermination from employment because he disclosed the felony arrest that arose from the\nconduct that caused him to be fired. This explanation might have been more plausible if\nApplicant had disclosed this employer in question 11 (employments\u2014last seven years).\nInstead, he disclosed only a single employer between June 1999 and June 2003.\nApplicant claims to have settled down and become a productive worker for his\nemployer. However, aside from the fact that he has had no significant criminal\ninvolvement since May 2001, he has provided no independent corroboration of his\nclaimed rehabilitation and changed lifestyle.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\n\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n4\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n\u00b632.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n5\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor judgment; (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, . . . good employment record . . .\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n6\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b617.(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n7\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. Under different\ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s five arrests in 1996  might be considered mitigated by the\n4\npassage of time, no further criminal conduct, and the substance abuse issues that\ncontributed to the conduct.  However, the lingering security concern is that each of\n5\nthese offenses goes directly to Applicant\u2019s honesty and trustworthiness. That security\nconcern is heightened by Applicant\u2019s May 2001 arrest for what amounted to\nembezzlement from his employer. To the honesty and trustworthiness issues raised by\nhis earlier criminal activity, Applicant added a breach of the fiduciary duty he had to his\nemployer. Although he was released from jail in May 2002, he was not released from\nprobation until July 2007\u2014about 18 months ago. I resolve Guideline J against\nApplicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his May\n2001 firing from his job (as he did the employment itself, although not alleged by the\ngovernment).  Disclosing a \u201cMay 1999\" arrest for the charges that were actually brought\n6\nin May 2001, does not constitute full disclosure of his employment and the adverse\ntermination from it. Further, I believe Applicant deliberately concealed the correct date\nof the arrest to put it farther in the past from his July 2007 clearance application.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose the information until his\nsubject interview later in July 2007 (Item 7).  Record evidence clearly suggests that\n7\nApplicant intended to conceal the fact of his termination for cause in May 2001. This\nconduct violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001, whether or not he was successful in effecting the\ncourse of his investigation.\nApplicant\u2019s concealment of relevant and material information demonstrates a lack\nof candor required of cleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining\nall relevant and material adverse information about an applicant before making a\n\n5\nclearance decision. The government relies on applicants to truthfully disclose that\nadverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived to be prudent or\nconvenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security\nviolations or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on\nto perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate\ngovernment interests. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Theft, breach\nof fiduciary duty, and falsifications are core security concerns [RAG &2(a)(1)]. His\nbehavior was deliberate and not due to circumstances beyond his control [RAG\n&2(a)(2); RAG &2(a)(5)]. His misconduct was both recent and frequent [RAG &2(a)(3)].\nApplicant was not a neophyte when he made his falsifications [RAG &2(a)(4).)].\nRehabilitation and other behavioral changes are difficult to measure under these\ncircumstances, as he produced no evidence to corroborate his claims [RAG & 2(a)(6)].\nHe clearly sought to mislead the government about employment and arrest [RAG\n&2(a)(7)].\nApplicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government\ninterests increases his potential vulnerability and he has not demonstrated that the\nmisconduct is unlikely to recur [RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9)]. The concern is whether\nApplicant would disclose situations or circumstances, whether deliberate or inadvertent,\nthat raise security concerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt\nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his criminal\nrecord and falsifications.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

On March 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines F, E, and J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 8, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on April 25, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge. DOHA received the request on April 28, 2008. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on June 17, 2008. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge on June 18, 2008. It was later reassigned to me on the basis of \ncaseload.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 25, 2008, setting the hearing for \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJuly 14, 2008.  Applicant moved to continue the hearing because his counsel had a jury \ntrial scheduled the same week in a state court.  The Government had no objection to \nthe continuance.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay in order for his counsel to be \navailable. DOHA issued a second Notice of Hearing on September 16, 2008, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 15, 2008. The Government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 through 9, which were received without objection. Applicant testified.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 22, 2008. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 25, 2008, Applicant denied all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR, with explanations He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old, divorced, and was born in a Middle Eastern country.  \nHe has two children who attend college. He immigrated to the United States and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 1976.  He is currently in a common law relationship with a \nwoman he considers his wife.  He lives in her house.  In 1997, Applicant was diagnosed \nwith leukemia.  He has been on Social Security disability since 1998 for this condition.   \nHis last chemotherapy treatment was in 2003, and his illness is in remission.  He is \ncurrently unemployed.  Previously, he was unemployed from 1996 to 2004.  He did \ntravel for a bank overseas to Africa and Asia in 1998 for which his expenses were paid.  \n(Tr. 20, 21, 30-32, 42, 55, 61, 62, 68, 88, 102, 116, 120; Exhibits 1, 3, 8) \n \n \nApplicant was the president of a family-owned supermarket corporation in 1981.  \nThe business failed in 1992, and a receiver was appointed.  After that business was \nsold, Applicant entered the potato chip distribution business from 1994 to 1996.  He \nstopped working when he became ill with leukemia.  He has not filed a state or federal \nincome tax return since 1995 because his income is too low to be required to do so, he \nclaims. In December 2007, his monthly income was $1,394, consisting of his Social \nSecurity income.  He did earn $7,200 monthly for each of four months in 2008 working \nfor a defense contractor, along with another $1,300 for part-time contractor work.  In \n2008, his annual income should exceed $30,000 with his contractor work and his Social \nSecurity payments.  He seeks a security clearance so that he can be a translator for a \ndefense contractor, making in excess of $200,000 annually. (Tr. 22-25, 31, 63-67, 78, \n116, 119; Exhibits 1, 3, 8) \n \n \nApplicant has 19 unpaid delinquent debts totaling $127,334. These debts include \ntax liens from the supermarket closure in 1992, various medical bills for co-payments \nrelated to his medical treatments, credit card purchases, which he has not paid, and \nloans.  Applicant claims he does not owe these debts, denying each of them in his \nAnswer, because the liens have expired under state or federal law, or the debts are \nuncollectible under state law as beyond the statute of limitations.  Applicant did not \nknow the term of the applicable statute of limitations.  He does not intend to repay any \n\n \n3 \n \n \nof these debts.  He has not contacted the creditors since he received the SOR in March \n2008.  He has made no installment payment arrangements, nor has he entered any \nnegotiations to compromise any debt listed in the SOR. (Tr. 23-27, 33, 38-49, 58-60, 66, \n67, 75, 80-93, 101, 104-115, 117, 129-131; Exhibits 2, 4-5, 7-9) \n \n \n \nApplicant owes $43,711 to the Internal Revenue Service on a 1998 tax lien \nresulting from the failed supermarket business.  Applicant also has a 1997 federal tax \nlien against him for $43,727 for the same business.  A state tax lien also is on file \nagainst Applicant for the same business taxes in the amount of $17,209.  These debts \nare listed in Paragraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c of the SOR.  His December 2004 credit report \nshows two federal tax liens and two state tax liens for individual accounts, which could \ninclude personal income tax owed for the 1995 tax year as Applicant told the \nGovernment investigator in 2007. Applicant claims some of these liens were filed \nagainst him as an officer of the supermarket corporation, and he has no obligation to \npay these amounts, in part now because the liens are not enforceable under state law.  \nApplicant denied knowledge of the federal liens, but also testified he learned about them \nin 1996 or 1997, though not the amounts until 2004.  His October 8, 2008 credit report \nshows the two federal tax liens as still current. Previously, while seeking a translator\u2019s \njob with a defense contractor, Applicant contacted an attorney and accountant in 2004 \nto get his tax liens removed from his credit reports. All of these remain unresolved. (Tr. \n22-27, 53, 66, 67, 73, 106-115; Exhibits 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 at pages 2, 11, 12, and 39, and \nExhibit 9)  \n \n \nApplicant owes $119 to a medical provider (Paragraph 1.d), $8,643.66 on a \njudgment from August 2000 in favor of a hospital for treatment rendered to Applicant \n(Paragraph 1.e), $1,153 to a collector for a medical account from 2003 (Paragraph 1.g), \nanother account for $3,636 owed to a medical provider from 2003 (Paragraph 1.h), \n$227 on a medical account from 2004 (Paragraph 1.i), $943 for medical services in \n2005 (Paragraph 1.l), another $252 owed to the same hospital from 2006 (Paragraph \n1.o), a debt for $1,635 owed to another medical provider from 2006 (Paragraph 1.p), \n$1,635 owed to a dentist for a crown replacement on one of his teeth in 2006 which he \nrefuses to pay because the crown was defective (Paragraph 1.q), another account from \n2006 for $1,404 owed to a medical provider (Paragraph 1.r), and the last medical debt \nowed listed in the SOR is for $251 from 2007 (Paragraph 1.s).  Applicant claims his \nmedical insurance should have paid all these amounts as a result of his leukemia \ntreatments.  Applicant also claims Social Security was supposed to pay all his medical \nbills while he received disability.  He relies on his state\u2019s statute of limitations for \ncontractual disputes in refusing to repay any of these debts. These debts are \nunresolved. (Tr. 32-87, 101; Exhibits 2, 4-9)  \n \n \nApplicant also owes five delinquent debts to non-medical creditors.  He owes \n$175 to a collector for a telephone bill from 2001 he disputes because the company \nallegedly overcharged him on the minute rate (Paragraph 1.f).  The next debt is owed to \na bank for a bad debt in the amount of $1,389 owed since 2005 (Paragraph 1.j).  \nApplicant claims there was a $300 limit on the card, but if he paid late or spent beyond \nthat amount, the extra fees would be imposed and those actions made the amount \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclimb to $1,389.  Applicant does not intend to pay that debt.  Applicant owes a \ndepartment store $177 on a charge card, but claims the debt is really owed by his \ncommon-law wife since 2005 (Paragraph 1.k).  He spoke with her about the debt, but it \nhas not been paid.  He owes a collector $933 on a delinquent account (Paragraph 1.m) \nowed since 2005.   Applicant\u2019s final debt is owed to collector on a credit card, in the \namount of $570 (Paragraph 1.n).  Applicant disclaims any knowledge of this debt or the \ncreditor.  Applicant relies on his state\u2019s statute of limitations for contractual disputes in \nrefusing to repay any of these debts.  None of these debts are resolved. (Tr. 38, 45, 59, \n60, 75, 81, 83-86; Exhibits 2, 4-9)   \n \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor for a while in 2007 and 2008 until his \ninterim security clearance application was cancelled.  He earned about $7,200 gross \nmonthly from April 2008 to August 2008.  In 2007, he earned $1,300 gross monthly \nincome for working two weeks one month, and two weeks the next month.  He worked \nin 1998 as a favor to a banker friend of his by traveling to Africa and Asia researching \npossible investment opportunities for the banker in the mineral exploration business.  \nHe also traveled to Canada in 2004, and to the Dominican Republic in 2006 on his own \nseeking business opportunities.  He spent his own money on a vacation trip to Mexico in \n2001. (Tr. 78, 88, 95, 96-98, 116, 129, 130; Exhibit 8) \n \n \nApplicant completed an initial security clearance application on December 22, \n2004.  He had to complete another one on March 9, 2005.  After completing the first SF-\n86, Applicant knew the questions which were on the form, and had until March 2005 to \nresearch and prepare his second set of answers. In answer to Question 36 regarding \ntax liens filed against him in the past seven years, Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d  His home \nstate filed a tax lien for $17,209 in May 1999.  On the same SF-86, Applicant answered \nQuestion 38 about being over 180 days delinquent on any debt in the previous seven \nyears with a negative answer.  Applicant did not list the delinquent debts in SOR \nParagraphs 1.d ($117), f ($175), g ($1,153), and h ($3,636), which he should have \ndone.  On the March 2005 SF-86, Applicant did not list all his delinquent debts on which \nhe was then more than 90 days delinquent in answer to Question 39.  He answered with \na \u201cyes\u201d response, and stated \u201cmedical bills\u201d owed to one collector, which is listed at \nSOR Paragraph 1.i for $227. He also listed the judgment in Paragraph 1.e in response \nto Question 37. He did not list the two federal tax liens, and the debts in Paragraphs 1.d \n($117), f ($175), g ($1,153), h ($3,636), j ($1,389), and k ($177), which he should have \ndone.  Applicant claimed he did not know the debts were on his credit report, and that \nhe never got notice of the liens because he does not own any real estate. Applicant \nadmitted he learned of the tax liens in 1996. Applicant received the medical treatment \nand knew he had co-payments due.  He knew about his tax liens and his credit card \ndebts because of the monthly statements the banks send.  Applicant\u2019s statements about \na lack of knowledge of any debts he should have disclosed is not credible. Applicant \nsigned his name on the SF-86 stating his answers were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct.\u201d  \nHe also acknowledged that a \u201cknowing and willful false statement on this form can be \npunished\u201d pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001. (Tr. 26, 32-35, 47, 50, 65-69; Exhibits 8, 9)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant opened several charge accounts between 1997 and 2001 while he was \nunemployed and being treated for leukemia.  Several of those accounts became \ndelinquent.  He closed some of the accounts.  Others were referred for collection action. \n(Exhibits 2, 4, 5, and 9)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cthe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been \nunable and unwilling to pay these obligations.  He has taken no action to resolve these \n19 delinquent debts totaling $127,334.  He now refuses to repay any part or all of these \ndebts, citing the expiration of the tax liens and the state statute of limitations on \ncontractual breaches. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \ndelinquent debt arose between 1995 and the present time. He accumulated delinquent \ndebt due to his medical issues and chronic unemployment. I find the behavior occurred \nunder circumstances that are likely to recur and continue, and it does raise concerns \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  The evidence raises this \npotentially mitigating condition in a very limited way, but it is more than offset by his \nactions of incurring debt while on disability, and engaging in business activities while \nundergoing leukemia treatments.  He has done nothing in the past nine years to resolve \nthese debts, or to earn himself a reasonable income.  Now he wants a security \nclearance to work as a translator, earn a large income, but refuses to repay these debts \nbecause he seeks to use state laws barring the collection of these accounts, but \nignoring the Government\u2019s security concerns about his substantial unresolved debts.. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from his medical problems, including the substantial \nmedical bills and his lengthy periods of unemployment. He has not acted responsibly in \nidentifying and resolving these debts during the past years.  He traveled to different \nparts of the world on business and opened a variety of charge accounts or incurred debt \nwhich became delinquent while unemployed and on disability pay. Although some of the \ndebts occurred as a result of Applicant\u2019s illness, I do not find that this potentially \nmitigating condition can be given full application, because he has not acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not exercised either of these courses of action.  \nI conclude these potentially mitigating conditions do not apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (e) posits that \u201can individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem, and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue.\u201d  Applicant offered no documentary evidence to show he \ndisputed any debt, particularly the medical co-payments, or took any actions to resolve \nthem.  He let them accumulate and waited for them to be charged off, barred by state \nlaw, or otherwise hide behind some barrier. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (f) concerning affluence from a legal income source is not applicable in \nthis case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative \ntermination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with \nsecurity processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security investigator for \nsubject interview, completing security forms or releases, and cooperation with medical \nor psychological evaluation; and, \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in connection with a \npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a) is applicable.  Applicant did not disclose his state tax lien, which was \nfiled against him in the previous seven years.  Nor did he disclose delinquent debts, \nwhich were unpaid more than 180 days, or were currently in 2005 more than 90 days \npast due.  Applicant knew he had medical treatments, and knew he had co-payments \ndue.  Any adult in the United States who has medical insurance knows about co-\npayments, and receives statements from their insurance companies concerning \npayments for their treatments.  Applicant also opened charge accounts from 1995 to \n2001, at least, and had only his Social Security income to make payments.  Either he \nkept track of his debts, or did not, but he knew he had them.  His statements that he \nlacked knowledge about his debts are not believable.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:  \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or \nlegal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide \nthe information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate \nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs \nunder circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n  \n \nApplicant took none of the actions necessary to correct his deliberate falsification \non his SF-86.  He knew he had debts, even listed some on his SF-86, and he knew \nwhat information the Government sought on the SF-86 because he completed one in \n2004.  He should have researched and amplified his answers for full disclosure on his \n2005 SF-86, rather than answering in the negative, which he did.  Under these facts, I \nfind his explanation for non-disclosure non-credible, and a deliberate falsification. None \nof the above conditions are supported by the record evidence. \n  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying:  \n \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n \nThe deliberate falsification of the information entered on an SF-86 is a violation of \n18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  It is punishable by a fine of $10,000 or more, and more than a \nyear in prison, making it a felony offense.  Applicant does not have to be formally \ncharged for this disqualifying condition to be applicable. AG \u00b6 31 (a) and (c) are \napplicable here.    \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under this \nguideline:  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n           (b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement; and, \n \n \n(e) potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be mitigated \nunless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries of the Military \nDepartments or designee; or the Directors of Washington Headquarters Services \n(WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) or designee, has granted a waiver. \n  \n \nBased on the evidence, none of the above mitigating conditions are applicable \nhere.  Applicant deliberately omitted disclosing required information to the Government \nupon which it could make an informed decision on his security clearance application. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature adult \nbusinessman who knew he had debts, and deliberately avoided resolving them.  He \nfalsified his SF-86 to hide the magnitude of the debts.  His explanations of what he \nknew about his debts and when he knew the information were not credible or \npersuasive.  He traveled on business while on Social Security disability to foreign lands, \n\n \n11 \n \n \nand opened charge accounts during the same period when his income was limited to \nthose disability payments.  He has isolated himself from any ownership responsibilities, \nand his testimony demonstrated his avoidance of any obligation to repay debts, \nincluding those for his medical treatments.  Applicant appeared adamant that he would \nnever repay any of the listed debts, nor expend any effort to resolve them except by the \npassage of time.  $127,334 of delinquent debt is a large amount to ignore. \n \nWhile the Government is not a collection agency, the issue in this case is \nwhether Applicant acted responsibly under the events as they occurred, or did he show \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations \nwhich can raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Applicant\u2019s irresponsible and lackadaisical attitude toward these \ndebts shows he is not reliable or trustworthy.  He has done nothing since 1995 to \nresolve any of the debts, while actually opening accounts and incurring further debt.  He \ndid nothing about his co-payments during his medical treatments, and so that problem is \nnow compounded.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations, \npersonal conduct, and criminal conduct.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against \nApplicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j to 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 49-year-old, divorced woman with a bachelor of science degree in textile science earned in the early 1980s, and a master\u2019s of business administration earned in 1991. Since 2004, she has worked for a defense contractor as an interoperability architect. Currently she is providing support to DoD in records management policy (Tr. 37). From 1996 to 2004, she worked as an associate for another defense contractor. Before joining the defense contracting industry, Applicant served as a captain in the U.S. Air Force. She entered in 1984 (Tr. 60). While in the Air Force, she met her first husband, an Air Force pilot, and married him in 1986 (Exhibit 10). Shortly thereafter, Applicant and her husband began having marital problems. During the late 1980s, she had sexual affairs with three Air Force officers (Exhibit 13 at 2; Tr. 109). After her husband discovered her infidelity, he insisted that they attend marital counseling. She complied, and their relationship improved. In 1991, they had a child. Shortly after their child\u2019s birth, her husband was assigned to serve in the Gulf War. After Applicant\u2019s husband returned from his Gulf War tour of duty, their marital problems recurred. In June 1993, she began having an affair with a senior master sergeant who was a direct subordinate (Exhibit 10; Tr. 94). On September 11, 1993, Applicant filed for divorce (Exhibit 8 at 4). By then, she was having an affair with both her subordinate and his wife (Exhibit 10 at 1)",

Savarino, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn April 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E,\npersonal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 8, 2008, admitting SOR subparagraphs 1.a,\nand 1.c through 1.f, and neither admitting nor denying SOR subparagraph 1.b. In her\nAnswer, she requested a hearing before an administrative judge. I received the case\nassignment on July 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 23, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on August 25, 2008. During the hearing, I received\n14 government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and the testimony of three Applicant\nSeptember 30, 2008\n\nFor the past eight or nine years, Applicant has had physical custody of her daughter.\n1\nExhibit 8.\n2\n2\nwitnesses. The transcript was received on September 4, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe record evidence, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old, divorced woman with a bachelor of science degree in\ntextile science earned in the early 1980s, and a master\u2019s of business administration\nearned in 1991. Since 2004, she has worked for a defense contractor as an\ninteroperability architect. Currently she is providing support to DoD in records\nmanagement policy (Tr. 37). From 1996 to 2004, she worked as an associate for\nanother defense contractor.\nBefore joining the defense contracting industry, Applicant served as a captain in\nthe U.S. Air Force. She entered in 1984 (Tr. 60). While in the Air Force, she met her first\nhusband, an Air Force pilot, and married him in 1986 (Exhibit 10).\nShortly thereafter, Applicant and her husband began having marital problems.\nDuring the late 1980s, she had sexual affairs with three Air Force officers (Exhibit 13 at\n2; Tr. 109). After her husband discovered her infidelity, he insisted that they attend\nmarital counseling. She complied, and their relationship improved. In 1991, they had a\nchild. Shortly after their child\u2019s birth, her husband was assigned to serve in the Gulf\nWar.\nAfter Applicant\u2019s husband returned from his Gulf War tour of duty, their marital\nproblems recurred. In June 1993, she began having an affair with a senior master\nsergeant who was a direct subordinate (Exhibit 10; Tr. 94). On September 11, 1993,\nApplicant filed for divorce (Exhibit 8 at 4). By then, she was having an affair with both\nher subordinate and his wife (Exhibit 10 at 1). \nIn late September 1993, Applicant\u2019s husband answered the divorce petition, and\nfiled a counterclaim alleging adultery (Exhibit 4). In her reply, Applicant denied adultery\n(Exhibit 5, \u00b6 3). In May 1994, during the ensuing trial, Applicant reiterated her denial\n(Answer, SOR \u00b6 1.c, Exhibit 7). At the conclusion of the trial, the court declined to make\na specific finding of adultery, and granted joint custody of their child, with physical\ncustody to Applicant\u2019s husband (Exhibit 6).1\nAt some time during 1994, Applicant was nominated for a position requiring\naccess to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  During a subsequent screening\n2\ninterview in June 1994, in response to the following question, \u201cAre there any incidents in\nyour background which might make you susceptible to blackmail or exploitation such as:\nextra-marital affairs, undetected theft, fraud, embezzlement, etc.?\u201d; she disclosed\n\nThe reassignment had nothing to do with her affair. The Air Force did not know of the conduct when it\n3\nreassigned Applicant.\n3\nneither the affairs with her subordinate and his wife, nor two of her affairs in the late\n1980s (Answer, \u00b6 1.d; Exhibit 8 at 4).\nIn October 1994, a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent interviewed Applicant\n(Exhibit 9). She again only disclosed one episode of adultery from the late 1980s, and\ndenied the affair with the subordinate (Id. at 2). By then, she had been reassigned to a\ndifferent location.3\nLater that year, Applicant\u2019s former commander under whom her paramour also\nhad served discovered a disk containing romantic e-mails that the paramour had sent\nApplicant, which confirmed their illicit affair (Exhibit 2 at 2; Tr. 68). Subsequently, she\nwas tried by general court-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the\noffenses of indecent acts, adultery, fraternization, and perjury (Answer, SOR \u00b6 1.a;\nExhibit 12). On January 3, 1996, she was found guilty and sentenced to dismissal from\nthe Air Force and forfeiture of $1200 in pay (Exhibit 12 at 3). \nApplicant\u2019s official termination date was December 20, 1996 (Exhibit 14). While\nApplicant\u2019s termination was pending, she began interviewing with several civilian\ncompanies. In March 1996, a defense contractor hired her. The position required a\nsecurity clearance. In November 1996, a DSS agent interviewed her. She then\ndisclosed all of her extra-marital affairs, her perjury, and her dismissal from the Air\nForce (Exhibit 13). In January 1997, she was granted a clearance (Tr. 78).\nApplicant worked eight years for the same employer without incident (Tr. 85).\nShe held a clearance throughout that time (Tr. 79). The current security clearance\napplication stems from a re-investigation initiated after she changed jobs in 2005 (Tr.\n114).\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s current supervisor, she has \u201can outstanding character\nand work ethic,\u201d and is a valuable employee \u201cwho will go above and beyond for the\nsuccess of the company\u201d (Exhibit A). At the hearing, a retired Air Force colonel who now\nworks for DoD in a civilian capacity testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. As the senior\nmanager for the project Applicant\u2019s company supports, he evaluates her approximately\nonce per year (Tr. 37). He characterized her as an outstanding employee who recently\ncompleted a highly complex project in an \u201cexcellent, excellent\u201d manner (Tr. 39-40). He\ndid not know her when she was dismissed from the Air Force, but is aware of the\ncircumstances surrounding it.\nApplicant attended therapy between 1994 and 1996. During this period, she was\ndiagnosed with depression, and briefly hospitalized three times (Tr. 81). Her depression\nwas successfully managed with medication (Tr. 80). The primary purpose of the therapy\nwas to help her adjust to the loss of physical custody of her daughter and her expulsion\nfrom the Air Force (Tr. 81). \n\n4\nApplicant remarried in 1999. She divorced her second husband in 2001 for\nreasons unrelated to marital infidelity.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative\ngoal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process is \u201cof special interest\u201d (Id.).\nWhile in the U.S. Air Force, Applicant engaged in several extra-marital affairs,\nincluding a 1993 relationship with a subordinate. She lied about the 1993 affair in a\nstate divorce proceeding, and later lied about it throughout a security clearance\ninvestigation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\n\n5\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities,\u201d 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative,\u201d and 16(e), \u201cpersonal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing,\u201d apply. \nApplicant attended therapy for two years after the 1993 extramarital affair and the\nsubsequent divorce. The primary purpose of the therapy was to assist her in coping with\nthe loss of physical custody of her child and her Air Force expulsion, rather than the\nissues which compelled her to repeatedly engage in extra-marital affairs. Consequently,\nalthough her testimony reflected remorse, the therapy was not comprehensive enough\nto trigger the application of AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d \nNevertheless, more than 12 years have elapsed since Applicant\u2019s conduct, and it\nhas not recurred. Shortly after her dismissal from the Air Force, she began to work for a\ncompany that required a security clearance. During the application process, she was\nforthcoming about the circumstances of the Air Force dismissal, and fully acknowledged\nher earlier falsifications. She was granted a clearance in 1997, and maintained it without\nincident for eight years. According to her supervisors, her work performance is\nexemplary. Also, both her supervisors and a neighbor characterized her as a\ntrustworthy individual. AG \u00b6 17( c), \u201c. . . so much time has passed  . . . that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security concern. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\n6\nApplicant violated her responsibilities as an Air Force officer when she engaged\nin an affair with her subordinate. She compounded this misconduct by lying about it in a\nstate divorce proceeding and a security clearance investigation. She was a mature,\nhighly educated woman who was fully aware of the magnitude of her transgressions\nwhen she committed them. \nAlthough Applicant attended therapy for two years at or about the time that she\nwas dismissed from the Air Force, it did not specifically address the issues that\ncompelled her to engage in the misconduct. However, twelve years have elapsed since\nthe misconduct. She disclosed the falsifications and discussed her history of adultery\ncomprehensively with security clearance investigators. The government granted her a\nsecurity clearance in 1997 with full knowledge of her earlier misconduct. \nSince being granted a clearance in 1997, Applicant\u2019s misconduct has not\nrecurred. Instead, she has been an exemplary employee, respected at work and in her\ncommunity. She is no longer married, and has had physical custody of her child for the\npast eight years. The serious and repetitive nature of the conduct is outweighed by its\nremoteness in time. I am confident that the probability of the recurrence is minimal.\nUpon evaluating the applicable mitigating and disqualifying conditions in the context of\nthe whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The first \nincident occurred in June 1997 and the fifth and most recent incident occurred in July \n2007. The five incidents are summarized below: \n \n(1) In June 1997, at age 17, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI). At the time, Applicant and his cousin \nwere drinking beer in a lettuce field. At the conclusion of the evening, \nApplicant drove home and passed out in his car at a stop sign near his \nhouse. A policeman discovered Applicant asleep in his car and took \nhim to the police station. At the police station, Applicant tested positive \nfor marijuana. In addition to underage drinking, he had been smoking \nmarijuana earlier in the day. Applicant went to juvenile court and pled \nguilty to DWI and was sentenced to two days in juvenile detention and \n\n \n \n3\nfour months supervised probation, and ordered to attend a drug and \nalcohol awareness program. (GE 3, Tr. 23-28.) (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \n(2) In February 2004, at age 23, Applicant was charged with possession \nof marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Applicant and \u201ca couple of his \nfriends\u201d were smoking marijuana in Applicant\u2019s apartment when the \npolice arrived in response to a noise complaint. The police seized \n29.35 grams of marijuana and drug paraphernalia from Applicant\u2019s \napartment. In March 2004, Applicant pled guilty to the charges and \nwas sentenced to six months in jail (suspended), fined $1,355, and \nordered to attend drug counseling. (GE 2, GE 5, Tr. 28-34, 55.) (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b.) \n \n(3) In November 2004, at age 24, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith DWI \u2013 Extreme (BAC > .15%). Applicant was drinking at a local \nbar with friends and was stopped for speeding while bringing a female \nfriend home. Applicant pled guilty to DWI and was sentenced to 30 \ndays in jail (20 days suspended) and three years unsupervised \nprobation, and fined $1,705. He was ordered to attend alcohol \nawareness classes and install an alcohol monitoring device on his \nvehicle for one year. He also lost his license for 90 days. He failed to \nattend the alcohol awareness because he \u201cnever got no information in \nthe mail like saying, you have to go here or, you know \u2013 and I never \ngot nothing else in the mail about it, so I just I guess left it alone and \nthey didn\u2019t get \u2013 call me back or anything about it.\u201d He also failed to \ninstall the monitoring device because, \u201cI didn\u2019t get no paperwork either \nin the mail like saying, okay, you have to go here to get that installed. \nSo I had gone a good two years without it and then I got pulled over \nand they said, you need to have that in your car,\u201d discussed infra. (GE \n2, GE 3, GE 9, Tr. 35-40.) (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n \n(4) In September 2006, at age 25, Applicant was cited for speeding (65 \nMPH in 55 MPH zone) and driving on a suspended driver\u2019s license. At \nthe time he was pulled over, he did not have a driver\u2019s license because \nhe failed to get his license reinstated after losing his license in \nNovember 2004. When he went to the Department of Motor Vehicles  \n(DMV) to get his license reinstated, the DMV noted that he failed to \nhave the monitoring device installed following his November 2004 DWI \nand informed him that he could not receive his license until the \nmonitoring device was installed. In October 2006, Applicant had the \nmonitoring device installed on his vehicle and stated the reason he did \nnot have the device installed was because he did not want to have to \ngo through the hassle of dealing with the device if he had been \ndrinking. Applicant subsequently showed the court that he had the \nmonitoring device installed and the DMV reinstated his driver\u2019s license. \nThe court dismissed the speeding charge. (GE 2, Tr. 40-44) (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d.) \n\n \n \n4\n(5) In July 2007, at age 26, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npossession of alcohol in a park and drinking in public. In August 2007, \nhe pled guilty and was sentenced to 12 days in jail (suspended) and \none year of probation, and fined $380. (GE 8, Tr. 44-45.) (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe allegation under this concern, (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), is cross-alleged under criminal \nconduct, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. 1.c. and 1.e.). The facts regarding this allegation discussed \nsupra are incorporated under this concern. Applicant has been drinking since he was \n\u201c14 [or] 15\u201d years old. His drinking began with friends on weekends. He testified his last \ndrink was two days before his hearing and his drink of choice is beer. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \nDrug Involvement \n \n \nThe allegation under this concern, (SOR \u00b6 3.b.), is cross-alleged under criminal \nconduct, (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). Applicant began using marijuana when he was \u201c13 [or] \n14,\u201d \u201cin his teens\u201d (about 1994) and continued using marijuana until October 2006. \nApplicant remembers that date because \u201cthat\u2019s the day I got fired and that\u2019s the day I \nneeded to stop to get another job.\u201d (He continued smoking marijuana after his 1997 and \n2004 arrests. Both arrests involved use or possession of marijuana and his sentence \nafter both arrests included a drug awareness program or drug counseling.) (Tr. 49-51.) \n(SOR \u00b6 3.a.) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nIn his December 2006 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed, in response to a question \nregarding past drug use, that he last used marijuana in March 2004 when in fact he had \nlast used marijuana in October 2006. (SOR \u00b6 4.a.) Applicant credibly explained that he \nhad been using marijuana since he was a teenager and \u201cmessed up\u201d when completing \nhis e-QIP. He added that he corrected himself during subsequent interviews and freely \noffered the correct date when questioned about past drug use. He readily \nacknowledged the March 2004 date is incorrect and the correct date is October 2006. A \nreview of his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview in July 2008 confirms \nthis assertion. Applicant adamantly denied intentionally falsifying his e-QIP. He further \nstated that he \u201ceven let [his] mom proofread it or double-check it (e-QIP) because \u2013 just \nto make sure [he] did have everything that had happened to [him] during the past seven \nyears.\u201d (GE 3, Tr. 50-62, 68-72.) \n \nApplicant was terminated by his previous employer in October 2006 for dropping \ncalls. He worked for his previous employer from March 2001 to October 2006 as a \nteleservice representative. (Tr. 62-63.) (SOR \u00b6 4.b.) \n \nApplicant was cited for speeding in January 2007 and August 2007. He was \nrequired to attend driving school following the first offense and the citation was \ndismissed. Following the second offence, he paid a $210 fine. (Tr. 63-66.) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.c. \nand 4.d.) \n\n \n \n5\nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted four work-related certificates or awards documenting his \nsuperb performance since January 2007. (AE A, AE B, AE E, AE F.) Applicant\u2019s \nsupervisor submitted a reference letter in which he described Applicant as an \u201cexcellent \nemployee\u201d and added that \u201c[h]is willingness to learn [a] new task has put him above his \npeers.\u201d (AE D.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother testified on his behalf. She is employed as a corporate \nexecutive assistant and Applicant\u2019s father is employed as a truck driver. (Tr. 80.)  She \ndescribed her son as a \u201cgood kind-hearted person,\u201d who was brought up with \u201cgood \nprinciples.\u201d She described their family as \u201cvery tight\u201d and \u201cclose.\u201d She acknowledged \nApplicant made some bad decisions along the way, but she always tried to give him her \nbest advice, but unfortunately some of that advice \u201c[g]oes in one ear and out the other.\u201d \n(Tr. 75-75.) Applicant\u2019s mother further stated that her son \u201cpaid the consequences for \nhis actions, for his wrong decisions.\u201d She described him as a \u201cgood person,\u201d \u201c[n]ot just \nbecause he\u2019s my son, but [because] he is a good man.\u201d She stated that Applicant has \ndisassociated himself from the friends he got in trouble with and now associates with a \nbetter group of friends. (Tr. 77.) She concluded that his current job has done a lot for \nher son and she has noticed a positive and noticeable change in him. (Tr. 81.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole-person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n \n6\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism.  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n \nConclusions \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are raised under Guidelines J (criminal conduct), G (alcohol consumption), H \n(drug involvement), and E (personal conduct) with respect to the allegations set forth in \nthe SOR. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 articulates the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six criminal conduct disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two of those conditions are applicable in \nthis case: \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or \n\n \n \n7\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \nOver a nine-year period, Applicant was convicted five offenses to include alcohol, \ndrugs, and driving-related offenses, discussed supra.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions under this concern are applicable. Applicant\u2019s \nfive skirmishes with the law began in 1997 with a DWI arrest. In 2004, he was charged \nwith possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. Later in the same year, he was \ncharged with Extreme DWI. In 2006, he was cited for speeding and driving on a \nsuspended driver\u2019s license. In 2007, he was charged with possession of alcohol in a \npark and drinking in public. These arrests began when he was 17 years old and \ncontinued until he was 26 years old. \n \nThis nine-year history of arrests precludes application of any potential mitigating \nconditions under this concern. Applicant\u2019s past conduct clearly calls into question his \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and falls short of what \nis expected of those entrusted with a security clearance. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying. One of those conditions is applicable in this case: \u201c(a) alcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, \n\n \n \n8\n                                                          \nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with alcohol began as a teenager, which lead to his first \nDWI arrest in 1997. His second alcohol-related arrest occurred in 2004 for extreme \nDWI. Sentences following both arrests required him to attend an alcohol awareness \nprogram. Applicant was arrested most recently in 2007 for consuming alcohol in a park \nand drinking in public.1 Applicant continues to drink; however, there have been no \ndocumented alcohol-related incidents since his 2007 arrest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns:  \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not define the sufficiency of the passage of time, and there is no \n\u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. Based on my evaluation of \nthe record evidence as a whole,2 to include Applicant\u2019s history of three alcohol-related \narrests with his 2004 arrest being resolved as recently as 2006-2007 when he finally \nhad a monitoring device instated on his vehicle, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n2See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). \n   \n\n \n \n9\n                                                          \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply because Applicant does not fully acknowledge \nhis issues of alcohol abuse. He did not offer any evidence from a qualified professional \nthat he does not have a drinking problem. Even though he attended two alcohol \nawareness programs, he had a subsequent arrest for drinking alcohol in public in 2007. \nHe continues to drink alcohol to this day.  \n \nFurthermore, Applicant did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence \nsuggesting he has overcome his problem. Evidence of a diagnosis or prognosis from \nqualified medical authority would have been helpful. The fallout from past misuse of \nalcohol should be evident to him. His history of alcohol-related incidents, current \nbehavior of continuing to drink alcohol, and lack of evidence demonstrating that he has \novercome his past misuse of alcohol, leaves me with doubts that his alcohol \nconsumption problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(c) and (d) are inapplicable. \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight drug involvement-related conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two of those conditions are applicable in this case: \n\u201c(a) any drug abuse,\u201d3 and \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  \n \n    \nApplicant\u2019s testing positive for marijuana following his 1997 arrest and 2004 guilty \nplea to possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia4 warrant application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c). When arrested in 2004, he pled guilty to possession of 29.35 grams of \nmarijuana and drug paraphernalia. He used marijuana from about 1994 to October \n2006, a 12-year period. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n  \n \n3AG \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n4AG \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \n\n \n \n10\n                                                          \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), again there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining \nwhen conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of \nthe totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR \nCase No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana \noccurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence \nshows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \n\u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.\u201d5 \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence \nof drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge excessively \nemphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug use, and gave \ntoo little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \n\n \n \n11\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s two drug-related arrests and 12-year \nmarijuana use was continuing and ongoing. His last marijuana use occurred three \nmonths before completing his December 2006 e-QIP. Applicant receives partial credit \nfor disassociating himself from drug-using associates and contacts and changing the \nenvironment where drugs were used under AG \u00b6 26(b). He did not, however, submit a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. He \ndid not provide a prognosis from a duly qualified medical professional. The remaining \nmitigating conditions are inapplicable. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 15, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 sets out seven personal conduct-related conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns and may be disqualifying in this case. Four of those conditions are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n12\n                                                          \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation: \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted \ninformation on his 2006 e-QIP.6 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) provides a condition that could mitigate security concerns in this case, \nstating, \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(f) fully applies to SOR \u00b6 4.a. Although he admitted preparing his e-\nQIP, and answering incorrectly, I am convinced that when he completed his e-QIP, he \ndid not intend to omit information about the recency of his marijuana use.7 \n \n6Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application may violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1001. The Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995) as a \nstatement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making \nbody to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004). If \nApplicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance applications, his accurate answers \nare capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His criminal offenses are \nsufficiently serious to potentially jeopardize approval of his security clearance. Making a false statement \nunder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential sentence includes \nconfinement for five years and a $10,000 fine). In light of my ultimate decision, and the absence of an \nalleged violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 in the SOR, it is unnecessary for me to decide whether or not \nApplicant actually violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \n \n7 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an \napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \n\n \n \n13\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant freely admitted the extent of his marijuana use when later interviewed \nby an OPM investigator. His listed marijuana use certainly put the Government on \nnotice of his past drug use. Having had the opportunity to listen to his testimony and \nobserve his demeanor, his explanations as set forth in the findings of fact are accepted \nas credible. The evidence is not sufficient to show that he made deliberately false \nstatements when he answered he question regarding past drug use. \n \nAdditionally, the Government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nevidence presented that he was terminated after purposefully and repeatedly dropping \ncustomer calls and in 2007 was cited twice for speeding. The foregoing warrants \napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). \n \nPotential mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nGiven the length of time since Applicant was terminated for dropping calls, the \nfact that his current employment record is superb, and the behavior is not repetitive, AG \n\u00b6 17(c) fully applies to SOR \u00b6 4.b. The 2007 speeding tickets are minor offenses. \nApplicant attended driving school after the first ticket and the citation was dismissed. He \npaid a fine after the second ticket. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) fully apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.c. and \n4.d. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission. \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n \n\n \n \n14\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nWhole-Person Concept. Applicant receives credit for the turnaround in his conduct and \nlifestyle since 2006, which is relatively brief when contrasted with his previous lifestyle. \nHis work performance with his employer is good and weighs in his favor. Applicant has \nstrong family support, especially from his mother. There is some compelling evidence of \nhis responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. I am convinced that he is loyal to his \ncompany, his family and his country.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s five arrests or incidents involving criminal or vehicular misconduct \nspanning a nine-year period, his 12 years of marijuana use, and alcohol-related \nconcerns are serious, recent, and not fully mitigated. His conduct requiring law \nenforcement involvement and admitted drug use establish a 12 year history of failure to \ncomply with the law. Although he has purportedly turned his life around since October \n2006, his past record causes lingering concern and doubt about his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. The best indicator of future behavior is past behavior. Applicant has \nno one other than himself to blame for the record he has created. While I would like to \ngive him the benefit of the doubt, further time is required to establish that he has made a \nturnaround warranting the granting of a security clearance.  \n \n  \nApplicant is encouraged to continue on his current track. Time will tell whether \nhis ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations will continue. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude that he has mitigated \nsecurity concerns pertaining to personal conduct, but he has not mitigated security \nconcerns pertaining to criminal conduct, drug involvement, and alcohol consumption.    \n \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n15\nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through e.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n     Subparagraph 2.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  \n \n      Subparagraphs 3.a. through b.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  \n \n      Subparagraphs 4.a. through d.: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on June 7, 2007. On \nMarch 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines G and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 18, 2008; answered it on \nApril 29, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received \nthe request on May 2, 2008. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 16, \n2008, and the case was assigned to me on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on June 5, 2008, scheduling the hearing for June 25, 2008. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the \ntestimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which were \nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until \nJuly 9, 2008, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. Applicant timely \nsubmitted AX C through F, and they were admitted without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s response to AX C through F is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 3, 2008. The record closed on \nJuly 9, 2008. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered GX 10, a personal subject interview extracted from \na report of investigation, without calling an authenticating witness as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant, and he \nwaived it. (Tr. 28-30.) Accordingly, I admitted GX 10.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three allegations under \nGuideline G, but he denied the allegation of falsifying his security clearance application \nunder Guideline E. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old computer technician employed by a federal contractor. \nHe has worked for his current employer since March 2007. He holds an interim \nclearance, but he has never received a final security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-workers consider him hard working, knowledgeable, responsible, \nand helpful. (AX A, B, and F.) One of his co-workers testified at the hearing about \nApplicant\u2019s dedication and sense of responsibility. (Tr. 68-70.) His supervisor describes \nhim as organized, efficient, and extremely competent, with a strong work ethic. (AX E.) \nApplicant works on his parents\u2019 poultry farm about 24 hours a week, and he is described \nby his mother as a serious worker, a truthful person, and a person with a \u201cwarm heart\u201d \nwho makes friends easily. (Tr. 56-57; AX D.)  \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol when he was 19 years old. He consumed \nalcohol twice weekly, consuming 10 to 12 drinks of beer or liquor each time. He usually \ndrank at a friend\u2019s house, but he occasionally went to a bar. (GX 10 at 2.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on the afternoon of October 13, 2006, for driving under \nthe influence of alcohol (DUI). Police found him asleep behind the wheel of his car in a \nparking lot of a bowling alley. His car was straddling a concrete parking divider and the \nengine was running. (Tr. 38.) The police observed several empty beer bottles in the car. \nHe had consumed about eight beers, and his blood-alcohol level was .13%. (GX 10 at \n1.) In March or April 2007, he was placed in an accelerated rehabilitation program. He \nwas required to perform 50 hours of community service, attend three highway safety \nclasses, and attend eight group sessions of a drug and alcohol awareness program. (Tr. \n39; GX 6, 7, and 10 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was stopped by police in April 2007, as he left a construction site that \nhad experienced recent thefts. The police officer smelled alcohol and asked Applicant to \nperform several sobriety tests, which he failed. Applicant was arrested for DUI and \nfound to have a blood-alcohol level of .15%. He pleaded guilty and was ejected from the \ndiversion program. On October 22, 2007, he was sentenced to confinement for 15 days, \nlicense suspension for 2 years, a $500 fine, $2,500 in costs, and attendance at an \nimpaired driver program. (GX 3, 4, 5, 8, and 9.) He served five three-day weekends in \njail on a work release program. (Tr. 42.) \n \n \nApplicant is in a court-ordered counseling program, but he has not joined \nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar group, and he continues to consume alcohol. He last \ndrank to the point of intoxication about four or five months before the hearing. (Tr. 43-\n45.) He has never been diagnosed by a qualified medical professional or licensed \nclinical social worker as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \n \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on June 7, 2007. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 23c, asking if there were currently any charges pending \nagainst him for any criminal offense. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23d, asking if \nhe had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. \nHe did not disclose either of his two DUI arrests.  \n \nOn September 13, 2007, Applicant told a security investigator he did not list his \narrests because he was in the diversion program at the time he executed his application \nand had no convictions on his record. (GX 10 at 1). In his answer to the SOR, he stated \nhe did not disclose the pending charges because he believed his record would be \nexpunged. He also stated he was focused on completing the form so he could start his \njob, and he did not realize that his DUI arrests would affect his eligibility for a clearance. \nAt the hearing, he testified he was arrested for his second DUI while his application was \n\u201cin the process,\u201d and he \u201cjust let it go.\u201d (Tr. 35.) He made several corrections and \nchanges in his application in May 2007, after his second DUI arrest. (Tr. 60.) He \ntestified he thought his first arrest need not be disclosed because it would be expunged \nfrom his record. He admitted he did not think he would get the job if he disclosed his \nDUI arrests. (Tr. 51.) He testified a \u201ccareer services lady\u201d at his computer training school \nadvised him not to list them. (Tr. 50-52.) His advice from the \u201ccareer services lady\u201d was \ngeneral, not focused on any particular document, and occurred well before Applicant \ninitiated the security clearance process. (Tr. 51, 61-62.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe SOR alleges two arrests and convictions for DUI. The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads \nto the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: \n\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant\u2019s two DUI convictions raise this disqualifying \ncondition. \nA potentially disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201chabitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(b). \u201cBinge \ndrinking\u201d is \u201cthe consumption of five or more drinks in a row on at least one occasion.\u201d  \nU.S. Dept. of Health & Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, The  National Household Survey on Drug Abuse: Binge Drinking Among \nUnderage Persons, Apr. 11, 2002, available at  http://www.oas.samhsa.gov. The \nevidence concerning Applicant\u2019s drinking habits and his DUI convictions raise AG \u00b6 \n22(b).  \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption has \nbeen recent, frequent, and not attributable to unusual circumstances. It raises doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). Applicant \nacknowledged his \u201cissues of alcohol abuse,\u201d and he testified he is undergoing court-\nordered counseling. However, he continues to consume alcohol to the point of \nintoxication. I conclude AG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual is a \ncurrent employee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no \nhistory of previous treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n23(c). Applicant is in a court-ordered counseling program, but the only evidence of \nprogress is his own testimony, in which he admitted recent drinking to the point of \nintoxication. I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(d). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant \nhas not completed his court-ordered counseling, has not demonstrated a pattern of \nmodified consumption, does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization, and has not received a favorable prognosis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified his security clearance application by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to the question about pending criminal charges and not disclosing his \ntwo DUI arrests that were pending disposition. The concern under this guideline is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). It is not necessary for the \ngovernment to prove that Applicant understood the security significance of the omitted \ninformation; it is only necessary to prove he intentionally omitted it. \n \nApplicant has offered several explanations for his omissions. He asserted that he \nmisunderstood the questions and believed he was not required to disclose the October \n2006 arrest because he expected it to be expunged from his record. This explanation is \nsomewhat plausible for the October 2006 arrest but not for the April 2007 arrest. He \nalso asserted he was focused on completing the form as soon as possible and did not \nrealize his DUI arrests could affect his eligibility for a clearance. This explanation is \ninconsistent with his reliance on advice from the \u201ccareer services lady\u201d and his concern \nthat he might not get the job because of his DUI arrests. Based on all the evidence, I \nconclude Applicant knew the second DUI arrest should have been disclosed, and he \nintentionally chose not to disclose it. Accordingly, I conclude the disqualifying condition \nin AG \u00b6 16(a) is raised, shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant had an opportunity to correct his application when it \nwas returned to him in May 2007, after his second arrest. There is no evidence of any \nattempt on his part to correct the record until he was confronted with the facts by a \nsecurity investigator in September 2007. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns based on false or misleading answers also may be mitigated \nby showing that \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning \nthe security clearance process,\u201d and that, \u201c[u]pon being made aware of the requirement \nto cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 17(b). This mitigating condition is not established, because the \u201ccareer services \nlady\u201d was not an \u201cauthorized\u201d person and her advice was generic and not directed \nspecifically toward the security clearance process. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of his application violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. It was a felony, not a minor \noffense, and it was recent. It is his only offense involving candor, but it is part of a \n\n \n8 \n \n \npattern of irresponsible conduct demonstrated by his history of excessive alcohol \nconsumption and DUI convictions. His falsification did not happen under unique \ncircumstances, and it casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). At the hearing, Applicant equivocated about his falsification, but \nhe acknowledged his alcohol-related problems. His court-ordered counseling is focused \non his DUI convictions, but it is also designed to motivate responsible behavior. He is \nworking hard at his regular job and at the family farm. It is too soon to tell, however, \nwhether his DUI convictions and the security implications of his behavior will motivate \nhim to change his behavior. I conclude he has not carried his burden of establishing AG \n\u00b6 17(d).  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant presented himself as intelligent and articulate at the hearing. He \nobviously enjoys his work. His behavior for the last four or five years, however, raises \nserious doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity required for access to sensitive and classified \ninformation. More time is needed to determine if he will heed the recent \u201cwake-up calls\u201d \nin his life and change his behavior. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on alcohol consumption and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

On April 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines B and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 2, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 5, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDOHA received the request on May 5, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on June 9, 2008.  The case assignment to another administrative judge was \nmade on June 10, 2008.  It was then reassigned to me on June 19, 2008 based on \ncaseload considerations.  DOHA issued the original Notice of Hearing on June 25, \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2008, setting the hearing for July 16, 2008.  The case was continued to July 17th with \nApplicant\u2019s concurrence because I was taken ill, and the case was reassigned to \nanother administrative judge to hear. On said date, Applicant requested a continuance, \nand the motion was not opposed by the Government.  That part of the hearing process \nwas on the record and a transcript made of it, received by DOHA on July 25, 2008.  The \nhearing was continued and the case was reassigned to me again.  A second Notice of \nHearing was issued September 19, 2008, setting the new hearing date of October 16, \n2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 16, 2008. The Government \noffered Exhibits 1 through 8, and documents for administrative notice, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified.  He submitted Exhibits A through C, \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 22, \n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq and Syria. (Tr. at 19-25.) The request and the attached \ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as \nAdministrative Notice Documents I through XIII. Applicant had no objection to these \ndocuments. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 5, 2008, Applicant admitted all the factual \nallegations in the SOR, with explanations.  He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, married with one child, and worked in Iraq in 2006 as a \ntranslator for United States military forces.  He was wounded on March 21, 2006, during \nan attack while performing his duty.  He continued to serve and was evacuated in \nOctober 2006.  He has not returned to Iraq since then.  He works as a real estate agent \nand owns his home in the United States.  (Tr. 30, 31, 47-51, 70; Exhibits 2, A, B) \n \n \nApplicant came to the United States in 1993 with his family after they fled Iraq \nand the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in \n1999.  His parents and siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens, and live in the United \nStates.  He has six sisters and four brothers.  Two of his brothers are deceased. His \nfather owns one-third of a house in Iraq which he inherited from his father.  Other \nrelatives own the remaining interests in the house.  One of Applicant\u2019s brothers lived in \nthe house from 2004 to 2007, but it is vacant now. (Tr. 65-79, 97, 98; Exhibits 1-8, A, B) \n \n \nApplicant entered a business arrangement in 2004 with certain family members, \nincluding a brother in Iraq, to purchase used trucks in Germany or other countries, and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nship them to Iraq through Syria because it has the closest port to Iraq.  Applicant \ntraveled to Iraq in 2004 as part of that business operation.  Applicant\u2019s brother planned \nto sell the trucks in Iraq.  Applicant expected to make about $30,000 on the transaction, \nbut only realized about $7,000.  That brother now lives in the United States and drives a \nsemi-truck. (Tr. 65-79; Exhibits 1-8, A, B) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s husband worked for the U.S. Government in Iraq as a \ncultural advisor.  He resigned this past summer, and now resides in the United States.  \nAnother sister\u2019s husband worked as a translator for the U.S. Government in Iraq, and he \nis now living in the United States. (Tr. 68, 69; Exhibit 2) \n \n \nApplicant has a cousin who is a driver for the Iraqi oil ministry, but he has had no \ncontact with him since December 2007.  Applicant listed a friend as a reference on his \nSF 86 who worked for the Iraqi Embassy in Washington, D.C., at least as of February \n2006.  Applicant has not had contact with him for two or three years. (Tr. 69-71; Exhibits \n1-8, A, B) \n \n \nApplicant married his Iraqi-born wife in Syria.  The arranged marriage occurred in \n2003.  His wife is an Iraqi citizen with a \u201cgreen\u201d card.  Her mother, an Iraqi citizen, lives \nin Syria, and Applicant sent her at his wife\u2019s request no more than $1,000 to support \nher.  He has not sent any money recently.  His wife worked in a book store in Syria for \ntwo or three years after fleeing Iraq.  His wife speaks with her mother and two brothers \nweekly on the telephone.  Applicant does not speak with them, and has no relationship \nwith his wife\u2019s relatives.  He has not seen her brothers since the marriage in 2003.  \nThey have not been to the United States.  Applicant does not know what his brothers-in-\nlaw do for a living.  His wife went to Syria in 2006 when he went to work in Iraq. (Tr. 55-\n64, 70; Exhibits 1-8) \n \n \nApplicant was rated highly in the performance of his duties as a translator.  He \nwas described as \u201cquite personable\u201d by his co-worker in 2006.  He was described as \nhaving expert abilities.  He liked his job and wants to return to Iraq. He held an Interim \nSecret security clearance while in Iraq and handled classified information without \nbreaching security regulations.  He was recommended for two awards for his translator \nduty performance. (Tr. 30-51; Exhibit A)  \n \n \nIn 1997, Applicant and a mechanic he employed were denied entry into Canada \nbecause the mechanic did not have a passport or a birth certificate.  Applicant was 21 \nyears old at the time.  Both men became rude and obnoxious to the Canadian border \nofficials.  He had to obtain a criminal clearance letter from his home state before he \ncould enter Canada again.  In 2004, while in Germany buying trucks, Applicant was on \na subway system.  He had a ticket for travel in certain zones, but needed to travel \nbeyond the zone limit.  He did not buy the additional ticket, and when confronted by the \nGerman ticket checker, gave a false address.  He paid the ticket and fees before he left \nGermany that year.  He has had no further trouble with law enforcement officials since \n2004. (Tr. 80-94; Exhibits 1-8) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nOn a day trip to Canada to have dinner and visit a casino in the fall of 2006, \nApplicant met two women.  He later had sexual intercourse with one of these women on \ntwo occasions.  Applicant defended his actions by asserting this relationship was in the \nnature of a \u201ctemporary marriage\u201d as explained in a book he offered as an exhibit.  The \nbook is titled, \u201cTemporary Marriage in Islam,\u201d written by the director of the Islamic \nInstitute of Knowledge, located in the United States.  Applicant has not seen this woman \nsince his last meeting with her in 2006, and has not had further sexual relations with \nher.  His wife does not know about this relationship.  (Tr. 85-91; Exhibit C)     \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove the dictator Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. That effort was \nsuccessful, and a new constitution was written by the Iraqi people.  After free elections, \nIraq\u2019s new government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq \nremains plagued by violence though safer and quieter this past year than previously due \nto the American troop increases since 2007.  Violent acts are perpetrated by Al Qaeda \nterrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have target the U.S. \nArmed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis.  Although the new \ngovernment has taken aggressive action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq \nremains high, as do human rights abuses. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Administrative Notice Documents) \n \nSyria is a Middle Eastern country with about 18 million citizens.  Syria is on the \nUnited States list of state sponsors of terrorism.  Since March 1963, it has been ruled by \nan authoritarian, one-party, socialist Ba\u2019athist regime.  It provides financial and military \nsupport to terrorist organizations.  It ruled part of Lebanon, a neighboring country, for \nover a decade.  It was determined to be involved in the assassination of former \nLebanese prime minister who opposed Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs.  In \n2004, the U.S. Government banned the export of Syria of products other than food and \nmedicine, and prohibited Syrian aircraft from landing in the United States.  This \nexecutive order was later expanded.  Syria has a history of human rights abuses.  Many \nIraqi refugees fled to Syria, and total about 1.3 million Iraqis.  There is a U.S. State \nDepartment travel warning about travel to and within Syria.  (Administrative Notice \nDocuments)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201dThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and  has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and two brothers-in-laws are citizens of Iraq, but are \nrefugees living in Syria.  His wife also lived in Syria as a refugee with her family until \nApplicant married her and brought her to the United States.  Applicant\u2019s family members \n(i.e., parents and siblings) live in the United States and are naturalized U.S. citizens.  \nWhile Iraq struggles with the creation of a democracy, it continues to be routinely \nvictimized by terrorist attacks. This creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. It also creates a potential conflict of \ninterest for Applicant.  Syria is a state sponsor of terrorism and ruled by an authoritarian \nregime. AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interests. In 1993, he came here as a refugee and proudly became a \nnaturalized citizen in 1999. He worked at various jobs since his arrival, until beginning \nhis position with a federal contractor in 2006. He does not own any property in Iraq, but \nhas a one-ninth interest in one-third of a house his father inherited in Iraq. That is a \nsmall percentage of this property.  He has a close relationship with his immediate family \nmembers who reside in the United States. He did not return to Iraq until 2004 on \nbusiness, and then again in 2006, when he started his job with the U.S. forces. He was \nwounded in an attack while working as a translator with U.S. forces. His ties to the \nUnited States are much stronger than his ties to his wife\u2019s family living in Syria.  \nApplicant has little or no contact with his wife\u2019s family in Syria.  He lives with his wife \nand daughter in the United States.  He is close to his wife.  She has returned to Syria to \nsee her mother only once since married to Applicant in 2003.   All business contacts \nwith his brother in 2004 to import trucks into Iraq occurred four years ago and the \nbusiness does not exist anymore.  .Applicant made little money from the effort and that \nbrother now lives in the United States.  His last contact with a friend at the Iraqi \nEmbassy in the United States was at least two years ago.  All other contacts listed in \nthe SOR are old and no longer exist in the same way as alleged in the SOR. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has no application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his spouse, \nbecause she has a \u201cgreen\u201d card and lives in the United States with him. There is no \nlikelihood that his marital relationship will create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.  It has some application to his contact with his wife\u2019s family members in \nSyria, because he does not have contact with them.  Although there is a remote \npossibility that terrorists could attempt to coerce or threaten Applicant through his \nmother-in-law or his wife\u2019s siblings living in Syria, it is highly unlikely.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide \ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any \nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with \nsecurity processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security investigator for \nsubject interview, completing security forms or releases, and cooperation with medical \nor psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in connection with a \npersonnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and, \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in \nanother country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or \nthat is legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve \nas a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or \nintelligence service or other group. \n \nThe SOR alleged three incidents of personal misconduct under this guideline. \nApplicant was involved in two minor incidents in Canada and Germany between 1997 \nand 2004.  The first involved rude behavior while trying to enter Canada with a \nmechanic he hired to work on a truck.  This behavior has not recurred.  The second was \nnot buying a zone ticket for a German subway ride.  His third incident of misconduct \ninvolved two adulterous incidents with a woman in Canada, which he labels \u201ctemporary \nmarriage\u201d within his Muslim religion.  His wife does not know about these actions.  \nThese adulterous actions could affect his personal standing in the community in which \nhe lives, if they became known to his family or community.  They demonstrate \nquestionable judgment and untrustworthiness within his marital relationship.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the \ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased \nor occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nMitigating Condition AG \u00b6 8 (c) applies here.  The first two incidents were minor \nand occurred long ago.  They are not a factor in determining Applicant\u2019s eligibility.  \nSubsequent to them, he performed very well in Iraq as a translator.  His adultery, \nregardless of his characterization of it as \u201ctemporary marriage,\u201d occurred immediately \nafter he returned from Iraq.  It was two years ago, and was consenting conduct between \ntwo adults.  It has not recurred.  It is a diminished factor in evaluating Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. The record evidence does not support the application of any other \ncondition. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq and Syria. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists \nare hostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and \neven friendly governments, could attempt to use his mother-in-law and her sons, who \nlive in Syria, to obtain such information. Second, he had connections to Iraq before he \nleft there in 1993. He was born in Iraq and spent his formative years there.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. Applicant is a mature person. He came to the United States as a refugee in \n1993 and became a naturalized citizen in 1999.  He has worked in the United States \nsince his arrival and currently resides with his wife and daughter.  His parents and \nsiblings also came to the United States, live here, and are citizens.  He owns property in \nthe United States. Out of his sense of gratitude and dedication to the United States, he \nworked with the U.S. Army, as an Arabic-speaking linguist. He takes his loyalty to the \nUnited States very seriously, and has worked diligently for a defense contractor in an \nimportant capacity for our troops.  He was wounded in combat, and after his wounds \nwere treated, he kept serving as a translator with our troops.  I give great weight to the \nletters of recommendation, written by the soldiers with whom he served. They assess \nhim as loyal and trustworthy, and praise his significant contributions to the cause of \nfreedom in Iraq. I also was impressed by the recommendations for two awards \nApplicant received.   After leaving Iraq in 1993, he did not return for 11 years and then \nfor the purpose of enjoying the new economic freedom brought there by the United \nStates. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States or failed to abide by his employer\u2019s rules and \nregulations.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his tenure in Iraq without any \nindication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence and \npersonal conduct.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.o:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a to 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR with explanation. Applicant is 48 years old and has been employed as a test and commissioning engineer for a defense contractor since 2000. Applicant was born and raised in Nigeria. He attended the equivalent of high school and two years of advanced schooling in Nigeria. He came to the United States in 1985 to further his studies. He received an associate degree in physics from a United States university but was required to drop out of school in 1987 when his father in Nigeria passed away and he did not have the financial resources to continue. He worked for a number of years and then enrolled in another United States college in 1997, and received a Masters of Electrical Engineering degree in 1999.

Eisen, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 22, 2006.  On May 1, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nApplicant under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 8, 2008.  He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 19, 2008, admitting all of the factual allegations in the SOR with \nexplanation.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department \ncounsel was prepared to proceed on June 16, 2008, and the case was assigned to \nanother administrative judge on June 19, 2008.  The case was reassigned to me on July \n18, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 28, 2008, and I convened the \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing as scheduled on August 28, 2008.  The government offered two exhibits, \nmarked Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection.  Applicant \nsubmitted seven exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits A through G, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf.  DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September, 8, 2008.  Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request for administrative notice of \ncertain facts relating to Nigeria. (Tr. 15-16)  The request and the supporting documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  \nApplicant had no objection to the request for administrative notice and the attached \ndocuments.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR with explanation.   \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has been employed as a test and commissioning \nengineer for a defense contractor since 2000.  Applicant was born and raised in Nigeria.  \nHe attended the equivalent of high school and two years of advanced schooling in \nNigeria.  He came to the United States in 1985 to further his studies.  He received an \nassociate degree in physics from a United States university but was required to drop out \nof school in 1987 when his father in Nigeria passed away and he did not have the \nfinancial resources to continue.  He worked for a number of years and then enrolled in \nanother United States college in 1997, and received a Masters of Electrical Engineering \ndegree in 1999. (Tr. 32-34)   \n \nApplicant arrived in the United States on a student visa.  His visa was changed to \na temporary visa when he had to leave school in 1987.  He became a permanent \nresident in 1994 and received his United States citizenship in 1999.  Shortly thereafter, \nhe started working for the defense contractor.  Since his arrival in the United States, \nApplicant has returned to Nigeria once in 1998 to visit his family and father's grave.  He \ndid not return to Nigeria when his father passed away in 1987.  (Tr. 34-37; Government \nExhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, E-QIP, dated February 14, 2007)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was also born in Nigeria and came to the United States in 1994.  \nThey met in the United States and married in 2003.  She is a permanent resident and \nplans to apply for United States citizenship as soon as she is eligible.  They have one \ndaughter, born in 2004, who is a United States citizen living in the United States.  His \n\n \n3 \n \n \nwife has three siblings who are citizens and residents of the United States.  Her parents \nare citizens and residents of Nigeria. (Tr. 36-39)  His wife has never returned to Nigeria \nto visit her parents.  He does not believe his wife has sent money to her parents for their \nsupport.  She does occasionally talk to them by telephone. (Tr. 57-58) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father died in 1987.  Applicant's mother was born in Nigeria and is a \nNigerian citizen.  She lived with Applicant and his wife in the United States from July \n2004 until April 2007 when she returned to Nigeria to visit her children.  She returned to \nthe United States in January 2008 and now resides with one of her daughters, \nApplicant's sister, in the United States.  She has a permanent resident card from the \nUnited States and intends to apply for United States citizenship when she is eligible. (Tr. \n39-43; Applicant Exhibit A, Permanent Resident Card, dated April 8, 2007; Applicant \nExhibit E, Security Clearance Application, dated December 22, 2006, at 19-25) \n \nApplicant is the oldest of 12 children.  He has two sisters who reside in the \nUnited States.  One is a United State citizen and the other came to the United States on \na lottery visa and is now a United States permanent resident.  His other nine siblings \nreside in Nigeria and are Nigerian citizens.  Applicant has little contact with his siblings \nin Nigeria.  He does not know the employer or status of employment of his siblings. He \nbelieves they work for banks in Nigeria.  One of his sisters may work for the Federal \nReserve Bank in Nigeria.  \n \nApplicant does not consider his relationship with his siblings in Nigeria as close.  \nSince the family lives in a village and communications are poor, they do not talk often. \nHe does not have frequent contact with them and some he has not talked to in years.  \nHe may have contact with one of the siblings once a year and does ask about the other \nsiblings.  He does have an elderly aunt who he talks to more frequently and does ask \nabout his siblings. (Tr. 43-44, 58-61; Government Exhibit 2, Answer to Interrogatories, \ndated December 3, 2007)   \n \nAfter their father died, the siblings considered what they should do for their \nmother.  The house that their parents lived in was run down and the siblings decided to \nrepair it.  Applicant assisted this effort by providing funds to his siblings in Nigeria to \nassist in rebuilding and renovating the house.  He does not have a property interest in \nthe house.  He does not own any other property or have any assets in Nigeria. (Tr. 29-\n31; Government Exhibit 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated December 3, 2007, at 4) \n \nApplicant has significant assets in the United States.  He owns his own home.  \n(Applicant Exhibit B, Mortgage payments, dated July 15, 2008).  He has almost \n$100,000 in assets in his employer's 401K savings plan. (Applicant Exhibit C, \nStatement, dated June 30, 2008).   \n \nApplicant is a valued employee of the defense contractor.  His direct supervisor \ntestified that he has known Applicant since he was hired in 2000.  They were originally \npeers.  In 2007, the witness was selected to head a project for the employer and he \nrequested Applicant to be on his team.  He is now Applicant's direct supervisor and \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninteracts with Applicant on a daily basis.  Applicant is technically competent with a \npositive attitude and good moral character.  Applicant has integrity and is trustworthy, \nand has protected sensitive client information.  (Tr. 16-24; Applicant Exhibit D, Letter, \ndated, August 8, 2008)   \n \nThe director of field services for Applicant's employer noted he has known \nApplicant for over eight years and has been both his colleague and supervisor.  \nApplicant constantly demonstrated a high level of maturity, discretion, and exemplary \nperformance of all of his duties.  He receives high praise from both his colleagues and \ncustomers for his work ethic and moral standing.  He has complete trust in Applicant's \njudgment and he is convinced Applicant will act in the best interest of the United States. \n(Applicant Exhibit D, Letter, dated August 5, 2008) \n \nA senior engineer for Applicant's employer noted that he interviewed and hired \nApplicant for the employer.  He has worked with Applicant since that time as both a co-\nworker and supervisor.  Applicant has been a diligent, capable, and respected member \nof the company.  He is mature and reliable and in his daily behavior shows loyalty to the \nUnited States.  His activities with colleagues and clients have always been professional.  \n(Applicant Exhibit D, Letter, dated August 8, 2008) \n \n \nNigeria is Africa\u2019s most populated country, with over a half of the population of all \nof Africa.  Nigeria became independent from Great Britain in 1960, and has a \nconstitutional parliamentary government.  The country was ruled by the military until \n1999 when there was a democratic election bringing back civilian rule. (Hearing Exhibit \n1, Background Note: Nigeria, United Stated Department of State, dated April 2008)  The \nDepartment of State continuously issues travel warnings because of chaos and \nlawlessness in Nigeria.  Lawlessness in Nigeria leads to car bombings, kidnapping of \nforeigners, and violent crimes.  Violence is particularly acute in the Niger Delta region.  \nReligious tension between Muslims and Christians results in occasional acts of \ncommunal violence.  Al-Qaida leadership has expressed interest in overthrowing the \ngovernment.  Road and air travel are dangerous. (Hearing Exhibit 1, Travel Warning \nNigeria, dated October 30, 2007)  The government\u2019s human rights record is poor and \ngovernment officials commit serious human rights abuses.  These include the \nabridgment of rights to change government, politically motivated killings by security \nforces, use of excessive force and torture, restriction on free speech and press, and \nother physical human rights abuses. (Hearing Exhibit 1, Country Reports on Human \nRights Practices-2007, Nigeria, dated March 11, 2008)  Nigeria has made progress in a \nfragile democracy.  Nigeria is one of the United States\u2019 key strategic partners in Africa.  \nIt became a major player in Africa helping to negotiate settlements with other countries \nand plays a vital role in peacekeeping operations.  Nigeria remains relatively stable \nalthough ethnic and religious clashes in part of the country are common. (Hearing \nExhibit 1, CRS Report to Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, January 30, 2008) \n \n \nThere have been improved and strong ties between Nigeria and the United State \nsince June 1998.  Bilateral relationships have continued to improve and there is good \ncooperation on many important foreign policy goals.  The Nigerian government has lent \n\n \n5 \n \n \nstrong support to the United States government\u2019s counter-terrorism efforts since \nSeptember 11, 2001.  Nigeria has played a leading role in forging an anti-terrorism \nconsensus among states in Sub-Saharan Africa. (Hearing Exhibit 1, Background Notes \non Nigeria, dated April 2008, at 11-12)  There is no evidence Nigeria has exploited its \ncitizens to obtain classified information from United States citizens. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThere is a security concern because foreign contacts and interests may indicate \nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not \nin the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests.  \nAdjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including but not \nlimited to, such consideration as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. (AG \u00b6 6) \n \n \nApplicant has nine siblings who are citizens and residents of Nigeria and he has \ncontact with them through telephone calls.  While he does not call any of his siblings \nexclusively, he does have contact with them as a group.  The government has \nestablished that there is a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion in Nigeria because Nigeria is a country with a poor \nhuman rights record and much lawlessness in the country necessitating a continuous \ntravel warning issued by the United States Government.  There have been kidnappings \nand killings of foreigners in Nigeria, particularly oil industry workers.  Applicant's siblings \nin Nigeria raise security concerns under Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI \nDC) AG \u00b6 79(a) (Contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if \nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(b) (Connections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information).  Each \nindividual contact with his siblings by itself may not create a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence, but the totality of the contacts may indicate a heightened risk of foreign \ninfluence.  There is no security concern for his mother and sister who are citizens of \nNigeria but live in the United States.  There is no heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion since they live in the United States and \nare not located in Nigeria. \n \n \nWhile not listed as a security concern in the SOR, I have considered that \nApplicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Nigeria.  \nApplicant lives with his wife in the United States.  These factors raise FI DC AG \u00b6 7(d) \n(sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.)  \n \n \nI have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) (the nature \nof the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interest of \nthe U.S.); AG \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so \nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and AG \u00b6 8(c) (Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so \ncasual or infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation) and determine all apply to Applicant\u2019s circumstances. \n \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  The Appeal Board consistently \napplied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise was that \nan applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice \nbetween the interest of the family member and the interest of the United States.  (See, \nISCR Case No. 03-17620, App. Bd, Apr. 17, 2006; ISCR Case No. 03-24933, App. Bd. \nJul. 28, 2005; ISCR Case No. 03-02382, App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005; and ISCR Case No. \n03-15205, App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not permitted to \napply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the new \nguidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to determine if \nan applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \n \nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s family in Nigeria causes security concerns, I \nconsidered that Nigeria is an ally of the United States, has a defense agreement with \nthe United States, and is one of the United States\u2019 substantial trading partners.  While \nNigeria has had a poor human rights record, I considered that Nigeria is improving its \nhuman rights position and its people enjoy basic freedoms.  There are no indications the \ngovernment of Nigeria or any group of terrorists or lawless entities in Nigeria have \ntargeted United States citizens or relatives of United States citizens to provide economic \nor other sensitive information.  While Nigeria is a country friendly to the United Stares, it \ncould engage in espionage against United States interests.  Friendly countries may \nhave profound disagreements with the United States or have engaged in espionage \nagainst United States economic, scientific, or technical interest.  A friendly relationship \nis not determinative, but it makes it less likely that a foreign government would attempt \nto exploit a United States citizen through relatives or associates in that country.  Nigeria \nis not a hostile country, nor is its interests inimical to the United States.  The United \nStates and Nigeria are large democracies, enjoy good relations, and are trading \npartners.  It is reasonable to consider that Nigeria would not take any action to \njeopardize their friendly position with the United States because of their need for trade \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand defense assistance from the United States.  It would be considered an act \nunfriendly to the Nigerian interest with the United States to coerce its citizens with \nrelatives in the United States to pressure their United States relatives to provide \neconomic or other espionage information against the interest of the United States.  \nWhile none of the considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all \nfactors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion \nfrom his family members in Nigeria. \n \n \nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a).  \nApplicant's contacts with his family members in Nigeria are minimal even though they \nare siblings.  He established that his family members\u2019 living conditions, life style, and \nprofessions, show that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and the interests of the United States.  Applicant \nestablished his family members in Nigeria are ordinary citizens leading normal lives.  He \nhas established that because of the positions and activities of his family in Nigeria and \nthe minimal contact he has with them that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of being coerced or pressured to choose between these people and his \ninterests in protecting the national security of the United States.  I have considered this \nmitigating condition in conjunction with Applicant's in-laws in Nigeria.  Applicant has \nestablished this mitigating condition concerning his in-laws for the same reasons as \nestablished concerning his siblings.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of interest either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, \nor country is minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest).  Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to duress is also \nimportant.  Applicant has been in the United States for over 23 years and a United \nStates citizen for almost 10 years.  He has a child born in the United States, who is a \ncitizen of the United States.  Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States, and he has no \nfinancial interest in Nigeria.  Applicant\u2019s one return trip to Nigeria in the 23 years since \nhe has left that country was solely for the purpose of visiting family.  He has significant \nassets in the United States to include his home and a retirement account.  Applicant has \ndemonstrated that he is not unusually vulnerable to duress.  Applicant has a limited \nsense of loyalty or obligation to his family in Nigeria, but has long standing relationship \nand connections in the United States.  In addition to his own family, his mother and two \nsisters are in the United States.  He has demonstrated that the lack of relationships with \nhis siblings in Nigeria and the relationship with his family members in the United Sates \nwill lead him to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  This also \npertains to his in-laws in Nigeria.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant has raised FI MC \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign citizens \nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation).  At best, Applicant's contacts with his siblings and in-\nlaws in Nigeria are minimal and he hardly knows them.  He is unsure of their \nemployment or their living conditions.  He does not communicate with his in-laws and \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhis wife communicates with her parents only sporadically.  He does not send his siblings \nor in-laws funds, or presents, and does not visit them.  In fact, he encourages his \nsiblings to come to the United Stares for a better life style. \n \n \nApplicant has met his heavy burden to show that his family members in Nigeria \ndo not cause a security concern.  I conclude FI MC AGs \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) are \nestablished. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept \nrequires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a single item in \nisolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness.  Applicant has family members in Nigeria, a country with a poor human \nrights record and lawlessness and terrorism.  He also has strong ties to the United \nStates.  He has been in the United States for over 23 years and a citizen for almost ten \nyears.  He came to the United States to get a better education and has continued to \nstrive to improve his status in the United States.  His mother and two sisters live in the \nUnited States.  He has a child who is a United States citizen and his wife is a permanent \nresident intending to become a United States citizen when she is eligible.  His financial \nassets are in the United States and not in Nigeria.  The family enjoys a typical United \nStates life style.  He is a valued and trusted employee, and his supervisors and co-\nworkers attest to his loyalty, honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness.  Overall, on balance \nthe record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On May 1, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\n\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  The SOR was later\namended to add allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Applicant requested that the case\nbe decided on the written record.  On November 10, 2008, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding that\nApplicant had deliberately falsified his security clearance application and whether the Judge\u2019s\nadverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline B.  As to the\nGuideline E allegations, Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose that he had been employed by the Saudi Arabian Ministry of\nEducation and that he possessed an expired Syrian passport.  In support of this contention, he argues\nthat he was confused by the questions that asked for the disclosure of the aforesaid information.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided on the written administrative record.  As a result,\nthe Judge did not have an opportunity to question him about the omissions and evaluate his\ncredibility in the context of a hearing.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s explanation as to why he failed to disclose the information in question.  The\nJudge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there\nwas a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and intentional.  Given the\nrecord that was before him, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the limited mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against\nthe seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nNovember 10, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on May 1, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nGuideline B, foreign influence. On June 2, 2008, the SOR was amended to add \nGuideline E, personal conduct concerns. (Item 4) \n  \n \nOn May 7, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and elected to have the matter \ndecided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's case in a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), dated June 20, 2008. The FORM contained nine \nattachments (Items) and 17 additional items for which Department Counsel request \nadministrative notice be taken. On June 30, 2008, Applicant received a copy of the \nFORM, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nApplicant's response to the FORM was due on July 30, 2008. As of August 14, \n2008, no response from Applicant had been received. On August 5, 2008 letter from \nApplicant\u2019s employer was received. Department Counsel did not object to the material \nand the letter was admitted into the record. On August 15, 2008, the case was assigned \nto an administrative judge. On November 5, 2008, it was reassigned to me.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Syria and Saudi Arabia. The request and the attached \ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing \nExhibits (HEx) I\u2500XVII. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of \nFact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the foreign influence factual \nallegations of the SOR with explanations and denies the personal conduct allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 72-year-old translator and cultural advisor who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since September 2003. He is seeking a security clearance. His \nemployer states Applicant\u2019s work performance has been impeccable. Applicant is a \nvaluable employee, a humble person, loyal citizen, and good friend. His quality of work \nis admirable. His employer would like to keep Applicant as an employee. In his job, he \nassists the U.S. Army. Applicant speaks and writes Arabic, Circassia, English, and \nFrench.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Syria in 1936. Following high school graduation, Applicant \nbecame an air traffic controller at a Syrian airport. (Item 8) He was a Syrian government \nworker because civil aviation is part of the Syrian government. In October 1970, \nApplicant received a bachelors of arts degree in English from a Syrian university. He \nthen went to work as a translator with the fire department. With time, he was \n\n \n \n \n3\nrecommended for promotion to fire chief.  \n \nIn October 1971, Applicant went to Saudi Arabia and was employed as an \nEnglish language teacher, at a three fold increase in salary. From 1971 to 1991, \nApplicant worked in Saudi Arabia. During that time he worked five years as a teacher of \nEnglish language at a school. Saudi schools are run by the Ministry of Education. He \nworked nine years with the Saudi Port Authority as a fire and safety chief, and six \nadditional years as a translator for private companies.  \n \nIn July 1991, Applicant \u2013 then age 55 \u2013 came to the U.S. and lived with his \ncousins and brother, a U.S. citizen. (Item 8) Applicant worked for two years as a \ntranslator for a weekly English\u2013Arabic newspaper. In February 2001, Applicant became \na naturalized U.S. citizen. (Items 7 and 8) Applicant has a U.S. passport issued in \nAugust 2001 and valid until August 2011.  \n \nApplicant has five sons and a daughter. Two of his sons and a daughter are \ncitizens and residents of Syria. Applicant has three sons living in Saudi Arabia. His \noldest two sons were born in Syria, were Syrian and French citizens, and live in Syria. \nHis oldest son was, at one time, a computer specialist, with whom Applicant has no \ncontact. His second son was a car salesman in the UAE, but now lives in Syria. His \ncurrent occupation is unknown as is the amount of contact Applicant has with this son.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s next three sons are Syrian citizens living in Saudi Arabia. Once every \nthree months, Applicant calls his son who works for an agriculture company. Three \ntimes a year, Applicant calls his son who works as a window decorator. Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with his other son is unknown. In 2002, Applicant traveled to Syria to attend the \nmarriage of one of his sons who lives in Saudi Arabia. His children\u2019s occupations and \nthe frequency of contact with him were provided as of January 2007. (Item 8) \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter was born in Syria, and is a citizen and resident of Syria. She \nis married and is a homemaker in Syria. Once a month, Applicant talks with is daughter \non the telephone. Her husband\u2019s occupation is unknown. In 2004, Applicant visited \nSyria to see his daughter. He stayed with his ex-wife and also saw his son who resided \nwith his ex-wife. In 2005, Applicant traveled to Turkey where his ex-wife joined him. \n \n \nIn 1970, Applicant\u2019s brother, born in and a citizen of Syria, deserted from the \nSyrian Army. Fearing arrest, this brother has no intention of returning to Syria. In 1982, \nthis brother wanted to visit his mother. Their mother was too old to travel to the U.S. so \nApplicant accompanied his mother to Turkey where his mother and brother visited. \nApplicant liked Turkey so much he contemplated purchasing a farm as a second home. \nNothing ever came of his desire to purchase land in Turkey. (Item 8) \n \n \nApplicant married and divorced four women, two foreign citizens and two U.S \ncitizens. He was married: July 1967 to June 1970; August 1971 to February 1992; \nFebruary 1993 to March 1994; and, February 1999 to August 2000. His first wife was \nborn in Lebanon and is now a Syrian citizen. His second wife was born in and is a \n\n \n \n \n4\n                                                          \ncitizen of Syria. His last two wives were native born U.S. citizens. In February 2001, \nApplicant took his father\u2019s last name. In 2003, Applicant\u2019s lawyer appealed to a Syrian \ncourt to change Applicant\u2019s first name and family name. His appeal was rejected.  \n \nIn September 2003, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions, Standard Form (SF) 86. (Item 7) In response to question 13, which asked \nabout having been employed by a foreign government, firm, or agency, Applicant \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d When Applicant taught school as a middle school English teacher, all \nschools are run by the Saudi Ministry of Education. Applicant answered as he did \nbecause he was not in a high level, advisory, or influential position.  \n \nQuestion 15 asked if during the previous seven years Applicant had an active \npassport from a foreign country. Applicant possessed a Syrian passport issued in \nJanuary 1993, which expired in January 1999. He surrendered his Syrian passport to \nhis company security officer in June 2008. He states he simply made a mistake when \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to the question.  \n \nApplicant asserts he is loyal and owes allegiance to the U.S. He is proud to be an \nAmerican. He states he has no affection for Syria, has no financial interest in any \nforeign country, owns no foreign property, and has no foreign business interests.  \n \nSYRIA \n \n \nSince 1963, the Syrian Arab Republic has been in a state of emergency and \nruled by an authoritarian regime.2 Syria is included on the Department of State\u2019s List of \nState Sponsors of Terrorism due to the presence of several terrorist groups operating in \nSyria.3 The Syrian Government provides political and material support to Hezbollah and \nPalestinian terrorist groups.4 Several terrorist groups\u2019 leadership and offices are in \nDamascus, Syria. In addition, Syria permits Iran to transfer weapons and supplies \nthrough Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.5 Syria is one of the primary transit points for \nforeign fighters entering Iraq.6 \n \n \nA Travel Warning is in effect for Syria following the September 2006 attacks on \nthe U.S. Embassy in Damascus.7 In 1998, mobs in Damascus attacked the U.S. \n \n2 U.S. Department of State, Country Specific Information: Syria, November 20, 2007 at 1.

The central institution of \nthe Saudi Arabian government is the monarchy.14 There are no political parties or \nnational elections.15 There is no right to peaceful change of the government.

There \nare strict limitations on workers rights, especially for foreign workers. \n \nThe religious police (Mutawwa\u2019in) (MOI) harass, abuse, and detain citizens and \nforeigners.18 The government sentences criminals to punishments according to its \ninterpretation of Shari\u2019a (Islamic religious law). Corporal punishments provided by law \ninclude public executions by beheading, amputations, lashings, and other measures \ndeemed appropriate by the judicial authorities. The Basic Law guarantees the \ninviolability of homes and the privacy of correspondence.19 Custom officials routinely \nopen mail searching for contraband.  \n \nThe U.S. and Saudi Arabia share a common concern about regional security, oil \nexports, and sustainable development. Following September 11, 2001, relations \nbetween Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have been strained. Fifteen of the suicide bombers \nin the terrorist attacks were Saudi citizens. In May 2003, suicide bombers killed 35 \npeople, including nine Americans, in attacks in the capital. In November 2003, a terrorist \nattack on a housing compound left 18 dead and more than 100 injured. In June 2004, \nterrorists killed three Americans. In December 2004, terrorist attacks on the U.S. \nConsulate killed five.  \n \nThe Department of State has issued a travel warning for Saudi Arabia due to \nconcerns about possible terrorist activity directed at American citizens and U.S. \ninterests.20 Terrorists continue to target housing compounds and other establishments \nwhere westerners may be located.  \n \nSaudi Arabia has been unwilling to publically disseminate statistics regarding \nmoney laundering prosecutions, but has moved to monitor and enforce its anti-money \nlaundering and terrorist finance laws, regulations, and guidelines.21 The Saudi \ngovernment has permitted or encouraged fund-raising in Saudi Arabia by charitable \n \n16 U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2008: Saudi Arabia, March 11, \n2008.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \n \n22 Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress, Saudi Arabia: Current Issues and U.S. \nRelations, August 2, 2006. (HEx XIV) \n \n23 Id. \n\n \n \n \n8\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n*  *  * \n \n \nApplicant has two sons and a daughter who are Syrian citizens living in Syria. He \nhas three additional sons who are Syrian citizens living in Saudi Arabia. As of 2005, \nApplicant was on friendly terms with his ex-wife who was a citizen and resident of Syria. \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a \nforeign country and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \n\n \n \n \n9\nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, the \npresence of terrorist organizations and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government \ncoercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States.  \n \n \nThe human rights records of Syria and Saudi Arabia places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable, burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith those family members living in Syria and Saudi Arabia does not pose a security risk \nand he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States \nand his family members. With their mixed human rights records, Syria support of \nterrorist organizations, and possible terrorist activity directed at American citizens and \nU.S. interests in Saudi Arabia, it is conceivable that Syria and Saudi Arabia would target \ncitizens in an attempt to gather valuable information from the United States. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his children and ex-wife create a potential conflict of \ninterest because these relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern \nabout his desire to help his relatives living in Syria and Saudi Arabia by providing \nsensitive or classified information. The Government produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his daughter and some of his sons, and his travels to Syria in \n2002 and 2004 to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \n\n \n \n \n10\ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority.  \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; [and] \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) apply with respect to some of Applicant\u2019s relatives because \nof his limited contacts with them. He has no contact with one son and talks to two of his \nsons three or four times a year. His infrequent contacts and not close relationship with \nthese sons have a low potential of forcing him to choose between the United States and \nSyria. He met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with \nthese relatives] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d His contacts and \ncommunications with these sons are so casual and infrequent as to not create a risk of \nforeign influence or exploitation. However, the same cannot be said for his daughter and \nother sons.  \n \nFrom the record it is not possible to find his children have not been political \nactivists, challenging the policies of the Syrian or Saudi Government. There is limited \nevidence as to his children\u2019s current jobs and their spouses\u2019 jobs, if any. Without \nknowledge of their current jobs, it is not possible to find his children do not currently \nwork for or have ever worked for the Syrian or Saudi Government or military or any \nnews media. The record is silent as to his children\u2019s current involvement in activities \nwhich would bring attention to them or that they or other Syrian or Saudi elements are \neven aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, I cannot find there is a reduced possibility that \nthese relatives would be targets for coercion or exploitation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States weighs against a security concern \nfor these relationships. However, based on the record provided I can not find Applicant \nhas \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d He worked for \ngovernment contractors for some years and his duty performance is greatly appreciated \nby his current employer.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to his daughter and other \nsons. Applicant\u2019s close relationship with these children is an important positive reflection \nof his character; the same close relationships raise security concerns for possible \nforeign influence.  \n \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                          \nThere is insufficient mitigation of the security concerns because of his close \nrelationship with them, his frequent contacts with them, and because of the nature of the \nSyrian and Saudi Government and the complicated, and sometimes contentious \nrelationship to the United States. See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with siblings \u201conce every two or three months\u201d not to be \ncasual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per year \nnot casual and infrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) \n(finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and \ninfrequent).24  \n \nThe record is insufficient to find AG & 8(f) fully applies. He has no interest in \nproperty in foreign countries but there is no showing as to U.S. property and assets.  \n \nThere is nothing in and of itself which makes Applicant\u2019s hiring of a Syrian \nattorney to file a name change appeal in Syria to be of security concern. I find for \nApplicant as to SOR & 1.h. \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions taken together are insufficient to overcome the foreign \ninfluence security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n24In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005))  and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n \n \n12\nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant=s personal conduct \nthat may be potentially disqualifying. Paragraph 15 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \nstates a concern where there is conduct \u201cinvolving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers \nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process.\u201d \n \nUnder AG & 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d and & 16(b) \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d \n \nApplicant=s false answer on his SF 86 and his response during his OPM interview \nconcerning his history of working for a foreign government and possession of a foreign \npassport tends to show questionable judgment, unreliability, and a lack of \ntrustworthiness. I find && 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nIn September 2003 Applicant failed to report his employment as a middle school \nteacher who was employed by the Saudi Ministry of Education. He also failed to report \npossession of his Syrian passport that expired in 2002 in response to the question \nwhich asked if in the last seven years he had an active passport issued by a foreign \ngovernment. Applicant stated he did not list the first because he was not a high level \nadvisor or employee of the Ministry of Education and simply made a mistake in his \nresponse to the passport question. He has since delivered the expired passport to his \ncompany security officer. He asserts he was not being deceptive. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is key to determining if Applicant falsified his SF 86. \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am unable to \nevaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to his \ntruthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest. Being unable to evaluate Applicant\u2019s credibility I cannot find Applicant\u2019s answer \nwas not deliberately false on the security clearance application.  \n \nUnder the Directive, an applicant may mitigate the security concerns arising from \nquestionable personal conduct under certain circumstances. AG \u00b617 provides \nconditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns, including AG \u00b6 17(a): \n\u201cif a person \u201cprovides the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d I find this \nmitigating factor does not apply. Applicant has not met his burden of proving that he \n\n \n \n \n13\nmade good-faith efforts to correct the omissions in his security clearance application.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) provides mitigation where \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time \nhas passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The security clearance application was \nexecuted in January 2003. I am unable to conclude it happened under unusual \ncircumstances or does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. I also considered \ncarefully the other potentially mitigating conditions and conclude they do not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As previously stated, \nbecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am unable to \nevaluate his demeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to his \ntruthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest. I am unable to find for Applicant as to personal conduct. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Syria, \ncompleted high school and college there, and in 1991, moved to the U.S. An important \nelement in the foreign influence analysis is that he lived in Syria and Saudi Arabia from \n1936 until 1991, which is approximately three quarters of his life. He did not become a \nU.S. citizen until relatively recently in 2001.  \n \nGuideline B decision concerning Syria and Saudi Arabia must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situation in those countries, as well as the dangers \n\n \n \n \n14\n                                                          \nexisting there.25 Syria supports terrorist organizations and terrorists operate in Saudi \nArabia.  \n  \nThere are factors supporting approval of his access to classified information. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 1991. He became a U.S. citizen in 2001. \nHe is well liked by his current employer. What is lacking is a compellingly explanation as \nto his loyalty is to the United States, rather than to Syria. There is limited evidence \nshowing his connections to the United States and to Syria.  \n \n Applicant has significant ties to his daughter and two sons who live in Syria. He \nhas close ties of affection to them. There is a possibility Applicant could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of his connections to Syria and Saudi Arabia, and to \nthe United States, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of fully mitigating the \nforeign influence security concern.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d26 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \nHowever, I conclude the government should not revoke his access to sensitive \ninformation. It is extremely unlikely that individuals in Syria or Saudi Arabia would target \nApplicant\u2019s relatives to gain access to sensitive, but unclassified information.  \n \nThe awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but \nis based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence \npresented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his \nsecurity worthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, foreign influence: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n25 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n \n26See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n \n15\n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Ursano, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 18, 2006. On May 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C, Guideline B, and Guideline E that provided the\nbasis for its decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant, acting pro se, answered the SOR on May 28, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 18,\n2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\nOctober 8, 2008\n\n2\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. Counsel for Applicant entered her\nappearance on July 7, 2008. On July 17, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for August 27,\n2008.\nThe parties appeared as scheduled. Twenty-one government exhibits (Ex. 1-21)\nwere admitted (Ex. 2 and 14 over Applicant\u2019s objections), including as Exhibits 8\nthrough 20 the source documents relied on by the government in a request for\nadministrative notice, infra. Applicant offered 46 exhibits (Ex. A-TT, Ex. R over the\ngovernment\u2019s objections), including as Exhibits X through TT the source documents\nrelied on by Applicant in his response to the government\u2019s request for administrative\nnotice, infra. I withheld ruling on proposed exhibits K and X through TT pending post-\nhearing submissions from Applicant addressing the government\u2019s concerns. The\ndocuments were subsequently admitted (see infra) without any objections. Applicant\nand two witnesses testified on his behalf at the hearing, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on September 5, 2008. Based on review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, and the facts accepted for administrative notice, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn June 16, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to Israel and its foreign relations, including with the United\nStates (U.S.). The request was based on publications from the U.S. State Department,\nthe Congressional Research Service, the National Counterintelligence Center, the\nCentre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. These publications were admitted as\nexhibits 8 through 20.\nOn June 24, 2008, I issued an order notifying both parties of those facts that\nwould be administratively noticed, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at\nApplicant\u2019s hearing and valid objections. The parties were granted until July 11, 2008, to\nfile any objections, and for Applicant to also propose facts for administrative notice. On\nJuly 8, 2008, Applicant was granted an extension of the response deadline to August 4,\n2008.\nOn August 4, 2008, Applicant filed his objections to certain facts for\nadministrative notice and he proposed facts for notice. His request for administrative\nnotice was based on publications from the National Counterintelligence Center and the\nCongressional Research Service, on U.S. government press releases and statements,\nand on several agreements and treaties between the U.S. and Israel. After considering\nApplicant\u2019s objections and proposed facts for administrative notice, I issued an order on\nAugust 18, 2008, notifying the parties of the facts accepted for administrative notice.\n\n3\nBefore the taking of any evidence at the hearing, the parties were provided an\nopportunity to comment on the facts for administrative notice set forth in the August 18,\n2008, order. Department Counsel argued for the inclusion of the following additional\nfacts: Israel has been known to target U.S. economic intelligence. Israeli citizens,\nincluding dual nationals, are required to enter and depart Israel using an Israeli\npassport. Israeli authorities may require persons whom they consider to be Israeli\ncitizens by birth to obtain an Israeli passport before departing Israel. Applicant renewed\nhis objections. Israel was not specifically identified as an active collector in the National\nCounterintelligence Center\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic\nCollection and Industrial Espionage-2005 (Ex. 15), and it would be impermissible to\ninclude Israel among the major collectors that have reportedly been repeatedly\nidentified as targeting multiple U.S. government organizations since at least 1997,\nespecially where the 2005 report specifically identifies only China and Russia as\naggressive collectors. Applicant conceded that it remained the U.S. government\u2019s\nofficial position that Israeli citizens who are dual nationals are required to enter and\ndepart Israel using an Israeli passport but his experience proved otherwise. I withheld\nruling on the disputed facts for administrative notice pending review of the evidence\nadmitted.\nFacts for administrative notice are those easily verifiable by resort to authoritative\nsources. After review of the evidence admitted into the record, including exhibits 8\nthrough 20 and X through TT, I agree to take administrative notice of the facts that\nIsraeli citizens, including dual nationals, are required to enter and depart Israel using an\nIsraeli passport, and that Israeli citizens may be required to obtain an Israeli passport\nbefore departing Israel. Although Applicant was allowed to depart Israel in April 2005 on\nhis U.S. passport, the certification was \u201cin an irregular and one-time case\u201d (Ex. R,\nEnglish translation). A one-time exception does not invalidate the general rule. To the\nextent that the Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage-2000 (Ex. 14) represented the official position of the government at\nthat time, I agree to take administrative notice of the fact that Israel was listed as one of\nthe nations that aggressively targeted U.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000.\nOngoing U.S. concern over espionage-related cases implicating Israeli officials,\nreported as recently as June 2008 by the Congressional Research Service (Ex. BB), is\na separate matter that has also been administratively noticed, as set forth in my order of\nAugust 18, 2008. The facts accepted for administrative notice are set forth in pages 12-\n14, infra.\nMotion to Amend SOR\nAt the close of the evidentiary record at the hearing, the government moved\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive to add a new allegation under Guideline C, to wit:\n1.d. You voted in an Israeli election in 2001.\nApplicant offered in response that he holds dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship because of his\nparents\u2019 citizenship and his birth in Israel. I granted the amendment based on\n\nThe documents subject to government inquiry were numbered 7, 8, 9, 14, 19, 22, and 23, in\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Objections to Proposed Administrative Notice and Request for Administrative Notice, dated August\n4, 2008.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he had in fact voted in an Israeli election in 2001. Applicant\nwas offered, but declined, any additional time to respond.\nPost-hearing Submissions\nAt the hearing held on August 27, 2008, I withheld ruling on admission of\nproposed Applicant Exhibit K pending receipt of a signed copy on or before September\n10, 2008. Based on expressed concerns of the government, Applicant was granted the\nopportunity as well to submit on or before the September 10 deadline a translation into\nEnglish of the Hebrew document admitted as Exhibit R, and to identify the origins of\nproposed Applicant exhibits DD, EE, FF, KK, PP, SS, and TT.  A signed copy of Exhibit\n1\nK, received on September 3, 2008, was admitted and substituted for the unsigned\nversion marked for identification. Applicant also submitted an English translation of\nExhibit R, and renewed his motion for admission of the documents that provided the\nbasis for his request for administrative notice. The government having failed to file any\nobjections by the September 17, 2008 deadline, the English translation of Exhibit R was\nadmitted and incorporated within Exhibit R, and Applicant exhibits X through TT were\nadmitted into evidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that\nas of December 2007, Applicant possessed an Israeli passport that expired in October\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he applied for, and was issued Israeli passports in 1992 and in\n2001 after he had become a naturalized U.S. citizen (SOR \u00b6 1.b), that he used his\nIsraeli passport to enter Israel in at least 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and\nthat he voted in an Israeli election in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). DOHA alleged under Guideline\nB, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s spouse is an Israeli citizen living in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6\n2.a), that his stepchildren (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and brother and sister (SOR \u00b6 2.c) are resident\ncitizens of Israel, and that he traveled to Israel in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, and\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). DOHA alleged under Guideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant\ndeliberately falsified his December 2006 e-QIP by denying that he had an active foreign\npassport in the last seven years.\nApplicant admitted the Guideline C allegations, averring that he had been\nunaware until November 2003 that possession of a foreign passport was an issue. He\nadded that he had attempted unsuccessfully to surrender it to the Israeli Consulate in\nDecember 2003. Informed by the Israeli officials that he had to keep it until it expired, he\npresented both passports on trips to Israel in 2005 and 2006, and has not renewed his\nIsraeli passport since it expired in October 2006. Applicant admitted the Israeli\ncitizenship and/or residency of family members, but he denied any vulnerability to\nforeign influence or duress because of these foreign family ties. Applicant also denied\n\nApplicant submitted as enclosures with his Answer the draft copy of the security clearance application\n2\nthat he submitted to his employer in December 2006 and a copy of the version prepared by security officials.\nThe documents were not in the file provided to me before the hearing. The documents were admitted into the\nrecord as Exhibit 21 and Exhibit 1, respectively.\n5\nany intentional falsification of his e-QIP. He had submitted an edited version of his\nAugust 1999 security clearance application to his employer which contained an\naffirmative response to the foreign passport inquiry, and surmised that the information\nwas transcribed incorrectly. Applicant apologized for having failed to note the\ndiscrepancy before signing the security clearance application prepared from the form he\nsubmitted.   After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\n2\nfact.\nApplicant is a 64-year-old vice president at an independent, not for profit\nresearch and development laboratory involved in defense work for the U.S. government\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 53-54, 109-11). He started there as a doctoral student in June 1972 and was\nhired as an employee after he earned his Ph. D degree. He has held a U.S. security\nclearance at the level of secret or higher since July 1978 (Ex. 3, Tr. 106). He seeks to\nretain the top secret-level security clearance that he presently holds (Tr. 105), so that he\ncan freely interact with the laboratory\u2019s staff involved in the redesign of a missile\nguidance system (Tr. 63), and oversee final implementation within the company of a\nsystematic process of program organization and execution designed to ensure timely\nassessments and optimum performance for the U.S. government (Tr. 112-14).\nApplicant was born in January 1944 in Israel to emigres from Poland. His\nparents, who acquired Israeli citizenship, had another son in 1948 and a daughter in\n1952 (Ex. 1, 2). After he graduated from high school, Applicant attended an engineering\ncollege in Israel (Ex. D, Tr. 215). His mandatory military service was deferred under a\nhighly selective program whereupon after graduation he would fulfill his military duties in\na technical capacity (Tr. 100-01). On earning his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical\nengineering (Ex. D), he served as an officer in the Israeli military from September 1965\nto May 1968 (Ex. 1, 2, 3, Tr. 103, 138, 218). He was in charge of a laboratory that\nmaintained airborne radar (Tr. 138). Just before he was discharged, he married his first\nwife, an Israeli native (Ex. 1, Tr. 180-81). After completing his compulsory three years of\nmilitary service, he worked for the Israeli government as an engineer (Ex. D, Tr. 133)\nwhile taking evening classes toward his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering at the\nsame university where he had pursued his bachelor\u2019s degree (Ex. D, Tr. 103). He was\nawarded his master\u2019s degree in 1971 (Tr. 102).\nHis work for the Israeli military and government focused on navigation systems\nand he was required to hold an Israeli security clearance for his duties (Tr. 134). After\nalmost three years in the government\u2019s employ, Applicant came to the U.S. for doctoral\nstudies in January 1971 (Ex. 1). He elected to forgo any funding for his Ph. D studies\nfrom his Israeli employer as he did not want to commit to returning to Israel to work for\nthem (Tr. 104).\n\nW hen asked about his entry into Israel, Applicant testified, \u201cI always stand in the non, the non-\n3\nresident line, and I show my American passport first and they stamp it first, but then they said that that\u2019s their\nprocess, you know, the people that man those booths, they are basically policemen. . . .\u201d (Tr. 171-72). The\nearliest U.S. passport available for review was issued in April 1997 (Ex. 5, O), although Applicant testified that\nhe first held a U.S. passport in 1982 for travel to Brazil (Tr. 142). It bears Israeli entry and exit stamps for the\ntrips taken to Israel only since April 2005.\nThe form admitted as Exhibit 3 appears to be missing questions 11 through 15. In a continuation\n4\nsheet appended to the DD 398, he listed the Israeli residency of his parents-in-law (Ex. 3).\n6\nWhile pursuing his Ph. D in instrumentation and control (Ex. C), Applicant began\nworking for his present employer in June 1972 (Ex. 1, 2). After he earned his doctorate\ndegree in January 1975, Applicant became a full-time employee of the laboratory. He\ndecided to remain in the U.S. because of better opportunities in his field and he felt he\ncould contribute more than if he returned to Israel (Tr. 144). Applicant acquired U.S.\npermanent residency in 1976 (Tr. 99), and in 1978 he was granted a secret-level\nsecurity clearance for his duties at the laboratory (Tr. 106). In 1979, Applicant and his\nfirst wife had their only child, a daughter. She is a native U.S. citizen from birth (Ex. 1,\n2), and likely has derivative Israeli citizenship based on her parents\u2019 Israeli citizenship\n(Tr. 183). Applicant and his first wife made a life together in the U.S., raising their\ndaughter here and educating her in the local public schools, and then at a private\ncollege in the U.S. (Ex. C, Tr. 183).\nIn May 1982, Applicant and his first wife became naturalized U.S. citizens (Ex. 1,\n2, M, Tr. 99), taking an oath of allegiance to the U.S. (Tr. 145). He made no effort to\nrenounce his Israeli citizenship. He traveled abroad extensively on his U.S. passport,\nbut also went to Israel to visit family about every four to five years (Tr. 235). After his\nmarriage, he was accompanied by his spouse and daughter (Tr. 184). He retained an\nIsraeli passport that he used exclusively to enter and exit Israel in September 1976,\nAugust 1981, February 1985, and June 1989 (Ex. 3),  as required of Israeli citizens\n3\nunder Israeli law.\nOn the death of his mother in 1987, Applicant inherited with his siblings an\napartment that they sold. Applicant gave his brother his $30,000 share \u201cas a kind of a\nloan.\u201d Applicant considers it a gift and does not expect to collect the funds from his\nbrother (Tr. 240). \nIn February 1992, he renewed his Israeli passport (Ex. 2). He traveled to Israel\non that passport in August 1992 (Ex. 3). In an upgrade of his security clearance,\nApplicant executed a Personnel Security Questionnaire (DD Form 398) on July 16,\n1994 (Ex. 3).  In response to the citizenship inquiry, he disclosed his U.S. naturalization\n4\nin May 1982 but did not respond to whether he had dual citizenship. He listed his former\nmiliary service for Israel and his foreign travel (Ex. 3).\nOn December 7, 1994, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his dual citizenship. He explained that acquisition of U.S. citizenship did not\noperate as a revocation of his Israeli citizenship, but maintained his allegiance was to\n\nExhibit 21 as originally completed by Applicant in August 1999 contains the same information as in\n5\nExhibit 2.\n7\nthe U.S., where he has been living with his family. Applicant indicated that he held an\nIsraeli passport used only to enter Israel for family visits as required by Israeli law, and\nthat he reentered the U.S. on his U.S. passport. Concerning his military service for\nIsrael, he could possibly no longer be in the reserves since he had reached the age of\n50. Applicant denied any willingness to return to serve in the Israeli military or to\nexercise any right, privilege, or benefit of his Israeli citizenship. Applicant acknowledged\nhe had failed to list his dual citizenship on his DD Form 398, but he denied any\nintentional omission (Ex. 7). In February 1995, Applicant was granted a top secret\nsecurity clearance (Ex. 2).\nApplicant and his first wife were granted a divorce in the U.S. in November 1996\n(Ex. 1, 2). Applicant traveled to Israel alone in February 1997, again entering on his\nIsraeli passport (Ex. 2, Tr. 184). In April 1997, Applicant obtained a U.S. passport valid\nfor foreign travel to April 2007 (Ex. O).\nIn July 1997, a new president/chief executive officer (CEO) took over\nresponsibility for Applicant\u2019s employer. The new CEO had more than 30 years of\nprevious experience with another defense contractor (Ex. B, C, Tr. 75). Within six\nmonths of his arrival at the laboratory, it became clear to him that a change in the\nmanagement structure was needed. Applicant stood out as strong leader with a knack\nfor understanding people\u2019s motivations and for identifying talented individuals. He was\nwell respected by the technical staff, and also showed himself willing to make changes\n(Tr. 81-82). These attributes led the CEO to propose Applicant\u2019s promotion. In spring\n1998, Applicant assumed a vice president\u2019s position with responsibility for the technical\ndirection, personnel evaluation, and hiring of approximately 800 technical staff members\n(Ex. C,  D, Tr. 57-59, 81-82, 107). Applicant proceeded to revitalize the organization,\nputting in place a system and structure that increased the quality, quantity, and diversity\nof the laboratory staff. Applicant\u2019s technical guidance and oversight of all engineering\nactivities earned him the respect of management and technical staff alike (Ex. A, C, Tr.\n59, 82, 89).\nIn February 1998, Applicant went to Israel for a vacation (Ex. 2). Through his\nsister, he met his current spouse, an Israeli citizen, who was a professor of Hebrew\nliterature at a private college (Tr. 174, 226). He reentered the U.S. on his U.S. passport\nin mid-March 1998 (Ex. O).\nIn an update of his security clearance, Applicant completed a security clearance\napplication (SF 86) on August 25, 1999 (Ex. 21) from which an August 30, 1999, SF 86\nwas prepared (Ex. 2).  He reported his dual citizenship with the U.S. and Israel, the\n5\nIsraeli residency and citizenship of his sister and brother (his parents were already\ndeceased), his military service for Israel from 1965 to 1968, his possession of an active\nIsraeli passport from February 1992 to December 2001, and his foreign travel, including\nto Israel in February 1997 and February 1998. He responded negatively to question 13\n\n8\nconcerning whether he had ever been employed by a foreign government, firm, or\nagency (Ex. 2).\nIn March 2000, Applicant was interviewed by a contract investigator for the\ngovernment about his dual citizenship status, his use of an Israeli passport, and his\nformer military service for Israel. Applicant indicated he did not consider his\nnaturalization in the U.S. a basis to cancel the Israeli citizenship held from birth. He\nagain affirmed his allegiance to the U.S. and while he continued to use an Israeli\npassport, it was only to enter and exit Israel as required by the Israeli government. His\nU.S. passport was used for all other foreign travel. He explained that his retention of\nIsraeli citizenship was solely for emotional reasons and that he did not vote in Israeli\nelections or have any contacts with Israeli government officials (Ex. 7).\nApplicant traveled annually to Israel in January 2000, 2001, and 2002, to visit his\nfuture spouse while she was on semester break from her academic duties (Tr. 150, 163,\n235). She visited him in the U.S. during the summers. As their relationship progressed,\nhe made it clear to her that any life together would be in the U.S. (Ex. V, Tr. 177). When\nin Israel in 2001, Applicant voted in an Israeli national election. He considered the\nelection for Israel\u2019s prime minister as \u201cvery critical\u201d to the history of Israel, and did not\nrealize that voting in a foreign election could be regarded as an exercise of foreign\npreference (Tr. 149-50).\nIn October 2001, Applicant renewed his Israeli passport for another five years\n(Ex. P). He presented this Israeli passport for travel to Israel in January/February 2002\n(Tr. 166). His spouse joined him in the U.S. in December 2002 (Tr. 164, 174, 225), and\nin January 2003, they married in the U.S. (Ex. 1, S, Tr. 172). She acquired U.S.\npermanent residency in September 2003 (Ex. T, Tr. 175). She has three grown children\nwho are resident citizens of Israel, and Applicant accompanied her on a trip to  Israel in\nOctober 2003 for her eldest son\u2019s wedding (Ex. 1, Ex. P). Again, his Israeli passport\nwas stamped on his entry and exit (Ex. P). Applicant also visited with his brother and\nsister (Ex. 4).\nSometime between October 2003 and early December 2003, Applicant learned\nfrom the Department of Defense that he would have to surrender his current Israeli\npassport (Tr. 157-58). On December 1, 2003, Applicant sent his Israeli passport to the\nIsraeli Consulate with an expressed intent to surrender it to comply with the\nrequirements of his U.S. security clearance (Ex. 5, Tr. 94-95). The passport was sent\nvia registered mail through his employer\u2019s classified document control office and with\nthe full knowledge of the laboratory\u2019s security director, whom Applicant had approached\nfor assistance (Ex. W). Following that mailing, the security director informed him that he\ncould respond negatively on his security clearance paperwork concerning possession of\na foreign passport (Ex. W). Applicant was subsequently notified by the Consulate that it\nwas not a repository of passports. He would have to retain it and could not destroy it as\nit was against Israeli law to do so (Tr. 158-59). The security director recalls that when he\nlearned from Applicant that the Consulate refused to accept the passport and wanted\n$14 to mail it back to him, he told Applicant to not send the money. Furthermore, that if\n\n9\nit was returned to document control, the company would resend the passport to the\nConsulate (Ex. W). Applicant testified that when he got the passport back, he asked the\nsecurity office to hold it for him, but he was told that there were no procedures in place\nunder which security could retain it (Tr. 159).\nApplicant kept possession of the Israeli passport. At his request, his sister\nchecked with Israeli officials about whether it was possible to enter Israel solely on his\nU.S. passport (Tr. 167). In April 2005, he traveled to Israel for 14 days with his spouse\nto visit family members (Ex. 4). He had his Israeli passport as well as he had been told\nby his sister that he would need it to prove his identity to obtain a form that allowed him\nto enter/exit on his U.S. passport (Tr. 236). On entering Israel, he stood in the line for\nnonresidents and presented his U.S. passport. After computer checks disclosed\nApplicant held a valid Israeli passport, he was permitted entry only after he also had his\nIsraeli passport stamped. (Ex. O, P, Tr. 167-69, 237). Once in Israel, Applicant obtained\nfrom the Israeli Ministry of Interior a document that authorized him \u201cin an irregular and\none-time case\u201d exit from Israel on his U.S. passport (Ex. R). He exited Israel on his U.S.\npassport and the document from the Ministry of Interior (Ex. O, Tr. 169). \nApplicant traveled to Israel twice in 2006, in January and again in July. One trip\nwas to attend the wedding of his youngest stepson (Tr. 232). He presented his U.S.\npassport initially and was denied entry even after he showed the form that authorized\nhis exit from Israel on his U.S. passport the year before. Applicant was allowed entry\nafter he showed his Israeli passport, and both his U.S. and Israeli passports were\nstamped (Ex. 5, O, P). Applicant made no effort to obtain the form that would allow him\nto exit on his U.S. passport since he had been denied entry on his U.S. passport even\nwith the form from the Ministry of Interior (Tr. 238-39). He stayed with his spouse\u2019s\nfamily primarily, but in July 2006 he also spent a couple of days at his sister\u2019s home (Tr.\n164). On October 15, 2006, Applicant\u2019s Israeli passport expired (Ex. 5, P). He renewed\nhis U.S. passport for another ten years in November 2006 (Ex.5, N). On August 21,\n2008, at the advice of counsel, Applicant mailed the expired passport to the Israeli\nConsulate notifying the Consulate of his intent to surrender it (Ex. Q). Applicant does\nnot intend to renew his Israeli passport (Tr. 160). Any future travel to Israel will be on his\nU.S. passport in the hope that he will again be authorized entry and exit by the Ministry\nof the Interior. He has been led to understand that he will have no trouble obtaining the\nrequired documentation (Tr. 171).\nIn conjunction with a recent update of his top secret clearance, Applicant was\nasked to complete another security clearance application. In December 2006, he\nprovided his employer with a marked-up copy of his August 25, 1999, SF 86. He made\nseveral corrections and/or updates, including that he had a current U.S. passport issued\nin November 2006; that he married his current spouse, an Israeli citizen, in the U.S. in\nJanuary 2003; and that he had held an Israeli passport that expired in October 2006\n(Ex. 21). An e-QIP version of the form was prepared by the security office and returned\nto Applicant for his signature (Ex. W, Tr. 202-03). On December 18, 2006, Applicant\nexecuted an e-QIP that was forwarded to the government electronically (Ex. 1). It\ncontained the updated information about his marriage, recent travels, and his\n\n10\nstepchildren and in-laws, but also a negative response to question 17.d. \u201cIn the last 7\nyears have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government?\u201d (Ex.\n1). Applicant did not notice the error before he signed it (Tr. 204).\nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on February 9, 2007,\nabout his foreign ties. He explained that his dual citizenship with Israel and the U.S. was\nmaintained due to his emotional connection to Israel and not for any advantage.  He\nexpressed his willingness to renounce his dual citizenship if necessary as a condition for\naccess to classified information although he would feel bad about it because he was\nborn there and has family there. Applicant indicated that his spouse had acquired U.S.\npermanent residency and was in the process of acquiring U.S. citizenship. He disclosed\nongoing telephone contact with family members living in Israel, once monthly with two of\nhis stepchildren and his brother and twice monthly with his sister. Applicant also visited\nwith them annually in Israel. The youngest of his three stepchildren was in the U.S. on a\nstudent visa since August 2006. While these Israeli citizens were aware of his employer,\nApplicant indicated none were aware of the nature of his work or that he was being\nconsidered for a security clearance (Ex. 4). However, he clarified at his hearing that he\nbelieves his siblings know he has a U.S. security clearance as he asked his sister to\ncontact Israeli authorities about whether he had to enter Israel on an Israeli passport\n(Tr. 197).\nOn December 20, 2007, Applicant responded to interrogatories from DOHA\nconcerning his foreign passport. He provided copies of his U.S. passports issued in\nApril 1997 and in November 2006, his Israeli passport issued in October 2001, and the\nDecember 2003 letter to the Israeli Consulate, attempting to surrender his Israeli\npassport. He denied any action to renew his expired Israeli passport or any intent to\nrenew it, and added:\nI attached my previous USA passport to show that all my entries to foreign\ncountries since my last security audit were done using my USA passport. I\nalso included a letter by our security officer dated Dec 03 showing that my\nIsraeli passport was sent to the Israel Consulate. I was refused and\nreturned to me. As long as the passport is valid (It expired Oct 06) it\ncannot be destroyed and [has] to be stamped on entry to Israel even when\nI use the USA passport which I did (Ex. 5).\nOn August 21, 2008, Applicant mailed his expired Israeli passport to the Israeli\nConsulate, notifying them he was surrendering it (Ex. Q). \nAvailable information about his family members shows that on August 26, 2008,\nApplicant\u2019s spouse was interviewed by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in\nconjunction with her application for naturalization in the U.S. (Ex. U, V, Tr. 175). She is\nscheduled to take the oath of citizenship on October 29, 2008 (Tr. 175). Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter, who earned a degree in classics, worked as an administrator for a U.S.\nuniversity\u2019s art department until summer 2008 when she went to France to take a\n\n11\npainting class. She has been to Israel only twice since her parents divorced, with her\nmother to see her maternal grandparents (Tr. 184).\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a resident citizen of Israel. He has worked as a project\nmanager on an urban renewal project for a major municipality in Israel since 2003 or\n2004 (Ex. 4, Tr. 230). He is a contractor and not employed directly by the city (Tr. 231).\nHe has never been directly employed by the federal government in Israel. His spouse is\na high school English teacher (Tr. 185-86). Applicant\u2019s sister is a psychologist affiliated\nwith a private hospital in Israel. Her husband is a physician for the same hospital (Tr.\n186-87). Applicant visits his siblings when he goes to Israel. He has a closer relationship\nto his sister and has stayed with her when he is in Israel (Tr. 164, 187), although he\n\u201cdefinitely\u201d has some loyalty and/or sense of obligation to both (Tr. 199). He would\nconsider giving his sister money if she needed it, but understands that he has an\nobligation to the U.S. government because of his clearance and would report any\nrequest for information, even from his sister (Tr. 180, 199). As of August 2008, Applicant\nhad telephone contact with his brother four or five times yearly and with his sister about\nthree times a month, although he had daily contact with his sister following his recent\nsurgery a few months ago (Tr. 187, 192, 228-29, 257). Neither sibling has any contact\nwith the Israeli government or military (Tr. 188).\nHis three stepchildren were grown (all over 30) when he married their mother (Tr.\n189). All three of them served in the Israeli military as required by law (Tr. 190).\nApplicant has a friendly relationship with them, particularly with the youngest who had\nstudied for his master\u2019s degree in the U.S. (Tr. 189, 192), but returned to Israel in\nFebruary 2008 after he graduated (Ex. 4). His two stepsons are architects who are\npartners in their own architectural firm started in 2001. Applicant understands they build\nlibraries for universities in Israel (Ex. 1, Tr. 191, 231). Applicant\u2019s stepdaughter is a\npsychiatrist who had been affiliated with a hospital in Israel before starting a private\npractice following the birth of a child (Ex. 4, Tr. 191, 231). Applicant sometimes speaks\nwith his stepchildren, usually the youngest stepson, when his spouse calls (Tr. 192).\nApplicant has an ongoing relationship with only one of his 12 cousins living in\nIsrael. She was his high school classmate who earned her doctorate in civil engineering\nand pursued a second career as a lawyer. She deals with patent law in a small private\nfirm. They correspond once a year by electronic mail although he recently had surgery\nand they exchanged several email messages (Tr. 195-96). Her husband teaches\nbiology in a medical school in Israel (Tr. 196). Applicant tries to see this cousin when he\nis in Israel (Tr. 234).\nApplicant has an Israeli friend whom he met while they were both Ph. D students\nin the U.S. and lived in the same student housing. This friend returned to Israel and\nworked for about 15 years for the Israeli government. He is currently employed by a\nprivate company that manufactures cable television equipment but has been treated for\ncancer. Applicant tries to visit him when he is in Israel (Tr. 136-38).\n \n\n12\nNeither Applicant nor his spouse provides financial support for their relatives in\nIsrael (Tr. 196). Applicant is active within his neighborhood in the U.S. (Ex. L). All his\nfinancial assets (pension and savings) are in the U.S. (Tr. 200). Applicant pays taxes in\nthe U.S. (Tr. 146) and votes in local, state, and national elections in the U.S. (Tr. 146-\n47). He has not voted in an Israeli election since 2001 (Tr. 148), and now that he\nunderstands it could be considered an act of foreign preference, has no intent to vote in\na foreign election in the future (Tr. 151).  Applicant considers himself a citizen of the\nU.S. first. Had his U.S. citizenship been conditioned on him relinquishing his Israeli\ncitizenship, he would have renounced his Israeli citizenship (Tr. 162). For about the past\nten years, Applicant has attended annually or sometimes twice annually meetings of a\nsociety that raises funds for the Israeli technical university from which he earned his\nB.S. and M.S. degrees (Tr. 222-23). He contributes financially to the Israeli university\nthrough the society, in the past five or six years $1,000 annually (Tr. 221).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is part-owner of a house in Israel. Her children stand to inherit\nthe home on her death. Applicant does not expect to inherit anything in Israel (Tr. 200-\n01, 240). His spouse receives pension payments that are deposited into an account in\nIsrael (Tr. 241-42). She has two brothers and a sister who are resident citizens of Israel.\nNone have any connection to the Israeli government. Two were farmers and the other is\na retired photographer (Tr. 242). Applicant\u2019s spouse travels to  Israel about twice a year\nto see her children and grandchildren (Tr. 243).\nThroughout his long career at the laboratory, Applicant made important original,\ntechnical contributions (Ex. G), and he also served as a thesis advisor for graduate\nstudents from the university where he earned his doctorate (Ex. H). The current CEO\nhas found him to be an effective vice president, a \u201ckey member\u201d of the management\nteam who has had a \u201cvery significant impact on the morale, focus and direction of the\nlaboratory.\u201d (Tr. 69). Applicant has the respect of former (Ex. C, G, Tr. 89) and present\n(Tr. 59, Ex. A, Ex. K) colleagues at the laboratory and of very senior U.S. military\npersonnel (Ex. H, I, J). All share confidence in Applicant\u2019s personal integrity,\ntrustworthiness, and commitment to the U.S. national security interest, and they urge\ncontinuation of the clearance Applicant has held without incident throughout his career\n(Ex. A, G, Tr. 65, 90). Under the laboratory\u2019s corporate bylaws, Applicant must retire in\nOctober 2009 (Tr. 69). He intends to stay at the laboratory until then.\nAfter review of U.S. government publications concerning Israel and its foreign\nrelations, including with the U.S., I take administrative notice of the following facts:\nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy of about 6.4 million people. Israel generally\nrespects the human rights of its citizens, although there have been some issues\nrespecting treatment of Palestinian detainees and discrimination against Arab citizens.\nDespite the instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel\u2019s relations within the\nregion since it came into existence, Israel has developed a diversified, technologically\nadvanced market economy focused on high-technology electronic and biomedical\nequipment, chemicals, and transport equipment.\n\n13\nThe United States and Israel have a close friendship based on common\ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. The U.S. was the first\ncountry to officially recognize Israel, only eleven minutes after Israel declared its\nindependence in 1948. In 1985, Israel and the U.S. concluded a Free Trade Agreement\ndesigned to strengthen economic ties by eliminating tariffs. The U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest\ntrading partner. As of 2006, 38.4% of Israel\u2019s exports went to the U.S. while 12.4% of its\nimports came from the U.S. In 2007, Israel imported $7.8 billion worth in goods from the\nU.S. and exported $18.9 billion in goods to the U.S. Israel is a prominent recipient of\nU.S. aid. Since 1949, the U.S. has provided over $30 billion in economic assistance to\nIsrael. Between 1976 and 2003, Israel was the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. The\nU.S. has also provided Israel with $9 billion in loan guarantees since 2003, which\nenable Israel to borrow money from commercial lenders at a lower rate. The U.S. and\nIsrael established in April 1988 a Joint Economic Development Group to develop the\nIsraeli economy by exchanging views of Israel economic policy planning, stabilization\nefforts, and structural reform.\nIsrael and the U.S. do not have a mutual defense agreement, although the U.S.\nremains committed to Israel\u2019s security and well-being. In 1989, Israel was one of the\nfirst countries designated a Major Non-NATO ally. As such, Israel receives preferential\ntreatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and access to expanded weapons\nsystems at lower prices. Israel and the U.S. are partners in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d missile\ndefense project, and have concluded numerous treaties and agreements aimed at\nstrengthening military ties, including agreements on mutual defense assistance,\nprocurement, and security of information. Israel and the U.S. have established joint\ngroups to further military cooperation. The two countries participate in joint military\nexercises and collaborate on military research and weapons development. The U.S. has\npledged to ensure that Israel maintains a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over its neighbors,\nand has been a major source of Israeli military funding. Strong congressional support\nfor Israel has resulted in Israel receiving benefits not available to other countries. Israel\nis permitted to use part of its foreign military assistance grant for procurement spending\nfrom Israeli defense companies.\nArms agreements between Israel and the U.S. limit the use of U.S. military\nequipment to defensive purposes. The U.S. has acted to restrict aid and/or rebuked\nIsrael in the past for possible improper use of U.S.-supplied military equipment. The\nU.S. is concerned about Israeli settlements, Israel\u2019s military sales to China, Israel\u2019s\ninadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related cases\nimplicating Israeli officials. Israeli military officials have been implicated in economic\nespionage activity in the U.S. Israel was listed as one of the nations that aggressively\ntargeted U.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000.\nTerrorist attacks are a continuing threat in Israel, many of which are directed at\nAmerican interests. U.S. citizens, including tourists, students, residents, and U.S.\nmission personnel, have been injured or killed by terrorists while in Israel, the West\nBank, and Gaza, although successfully perpetrated terrorist attacks declined in 2007 in\ncomparison to previous years. Due to the volatile security environment in Gaza and the\n\n14\nWest Bank, the U.S. continues to warn against any travel to those areas. Hamas, a\nState Department-designated foreign terrorist organization, violently assumed control\nover Gaza in June 2007. No official travel is permitted inside the Gaza Strip and official\ntravel to the West Bank is restricted to mission-essential business or mission-approved\npurposes. In 1996, Israel and the U.S. signed a Counterterrorism Cooperation Accord,\nwhich established a joint counterterrorism group aimed at enhancing the countries\u2019\ncapabilities to deter, respond to, and investigate international terrorist attacks or threats\nof international terrorist acts against Israel and the U.S.\nThe U.S. is the principal international proponent of the Arab-Israeli peace\nprocess, and has been actively involved in negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian\nconflict. With the European Union, the United Nations, and Russia, the Bush\nAdministration has been active in attempting to negotiate agreements between Israel\nand the Palestinian authority.\nUnder Israeli law, Israeli citizens do not automatically lose their Israeli citizenship\nwhen they become U.S. citizens.  Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, are required\nto enter and depart Israel using an Israeli passport. Israeli authorities may require\npersons whom they consider to be Israeli citizens by birth to obtain an Israeli passport\nbefore departing Israel.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n15\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the U.S. (AG \u00b6 9). A citizen of Israel from birth and also of\nthe U.S. since May 1982, Applicant continued to renew his Israeli passport to as\nrecently as mid-October 2001. As required by Israeli law, he presented his Israeli\npassport for entry into Israel  to see his siblings, and in recent years, to see his spouse\nbefore she emigrated and lately her children as well. The possession and/or use of a\ncurrent foreign passport raises security concerns of foreign preference (see AG \u00b6 10(a)\n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport\u201d), irrespective of whether it is\nnecessitated by foreign law or discretionary.\nApplicant is credited with attempting to surrender his Israeli passport in\nDecember 2003 once he became aware of the potential security issues, and with trying\nto enter Israel solely on his U.S. passport on his next trip in April 2005. When then faced\nwith the choice of being turned away at the border or presenting his Israeli passport, he\ncomplied with Israeli law, but he also sought and obtained Israeli approval to exit Israel\non his U.S. passport. That permission was valid only for exit on or before April 27, 2005\n(Ex. R), however. In January 2006, Applicant was rebuffed in his attempt to enter Israel\non his U.S. passport and the expired permission form, so he again used his Israeli\n\n16\npassport. When he went to Israel with his spouse in July 2006, he presented both his\nU.S. and Israeli passports and made no effort to reacquire the exemption from entry/exit\non his Israeli passport. With the expiration of his Israeli passport in October 2006, and\nno renewal, AG \u00b6 10(a) does not currently apply. Yet his use of the Israeli passport,\nespecially after he learned of the potential security implications, is an active exercise of\nhis foreign citizenship which raises concerns that he could be prone to make decisions\ncontrary to the interests of the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s voting in an election for Israeli prime minister in 2001 was an active\nexercise of his Israeli citizenship that raises additional concerns of foreign preference.\nAG \u00b6 10(a) (7), \u201cvoting in a foreign election,\u201d applies, even though Applicant traveled to\nIsrael to visit his spouse before their marriage while she was on break from her\nacademic duties. The election was collateral to his visit, but at the same time, it showed\nan ongoing interest in Israeli affairs and the future of Israel.\nHowever, the government\u2019s case for application of AG \u00b6 10(d) (\u201cany statement or\naction that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States; for example,\ndeclaration of intent to renounce United States citizenship; renunciation of United States\ncitizenship\u201d), falls short where it is based on statements from Applicant of an \u201cemotional\nattachment\u201d to Israel free of any statements or actions that diminish the loyalty or\nallegiance Applicant has held to the U.S. for the past 26 years.  While he indicated in\nFebruary 2007 that he maintained his Israeli citizenship because of the emotional\nconnection and that he would \u201cfeel bad\u201d about renouncing his Israeli citizenship, he also\nexpressed a willingness to do so as a condition of access and asserted a primary\nallegiance (\u201cultimate loyalty\u201d) to the U.S. (Ex. 4). Favorable sentiment toward Israel is\nunderstandable, given he spent his formative years there and his siblings are lifelong\nresident citizens, as well as the special relationship between the U.S. and Israel in\nmatters of defense, foreign relations, and trade.\n \nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 11(a) (\u201cdual citizenship is\nbased solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d) applies to the extent\nthat Applicant\u2019s Israeli citizenship is based on his birth there. While the U.S. government\ndoes not encourage its citizens to remain dual nationals because of the complications\nthat might ensue from obligations owed to the foreign country, the Department of\nDefense does not require the renunciation of foreign citizenship to gain access.\nNonetheless, there must be adequate assurances that a dual citizen will not actively\nexercise or seek the rights, benefits, or privileges of that foreign citizenship. Applicant\ncredibly testified that he has no intent of voting in a foreign election in the future, now\nthat he knows it is incompatible with his security clearance. His decision to not renew\nhis Israeli passport carries considerable weight in assessing whether he can be counted\non to refrain from the exercise of dual citizenship while he holds a security clearance.\nApplicant has no current travel plans that include Israel, but travel to Israel cannot be\ncompletely ruled out because of his family ties there. His trips taken since his marriage\nhave been event-driven, for the wedding of a stepson and the births of step-\ngrandchildren. He hopes not to have to go to Israel for a funeral (Tr. 236). Since he no\nlonger has an Israeli passport, he could be denied entry at the border. In the event he is\n\n17\nadmitted on his U.S. passport, Applicant indicates that he would seek permission from\nthe Ministry of Interior to enter on his U.S. passport (\u201c. . . then I come without a passport\nor an invalid passport and then have to either let me in or send me back. I guess they\nwould let me in and send me back to the Department of the Interior and I said that then I\nwill go and do it. . . . Tr. 238). Had Applicant considered reapplying for his Israeli\npassport should he be denied entry on his U.S. passport, it is unlikely he would have\nmailed his Israeli passport to the Consulate in August 2008, surrendering it. \nApplicant submits that he is willing to renounce his Israeli citizenship for access\nto classified information, but he has never been asked to do so (Tr. 99-100). AG \u00b6 11(b)\n(\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d) applies, but it\nis entitled to less weight if it is in any way conditional. A promise to renounce is not a\nsubstitute for concrete steps taken to achieve that end. While Applicant testified that he\nhas requested a form to renounce his Israeli citizenship (Tr. 252), he had not\ncommenced the process because it was not asked of him. His preference clearly is to\nretain his Israeli citizenship, but it is not necessarily disqualifying provided he can be\ncounted on to comply with DoD requirements. His recent surrender of his expired\npassport shows his good faith in that regard and mitigates the foreign preference\nconcerns.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has had a close relationship with his sister in Israel since his divorce\nfrom his first wife in 1997 (Tr. 257). He contacts her about three times a month and has\nstayed at her home when in Israel, including during his most recent trip in July 2006.\nWhile his bonds to his brother are not as strong, Applicant visits with him when he is in\nIsrael and he telephones him on special occasions (birthday, holidays) about four or five\ntimes a year (Tr. 257). Applicant\u2019s three adult stepchildren and their families are also\nresident citizens of Israel. While Applicant testified credibly that he is closer to his\nsiblings, he has cordial relations with his stepchildren, especially with the younger\nstepson who studied in the U.S. Applicant accompanied his spouse to Israel for his\nwedding and for the birth of at least one grandchild. With his spouse scheduled to take\nthe oath of citizenship in the U.S. in October 2008, she may well be subject to\n\n18\nobligations particular to her Israeli citizenship, but she will also enjoy the protections of\nher U.S. citizenship and residency. A heightened risk nonetheless exists through his\nspouse and her close relationships with her children and their families in Israel. AG \u00b6\n7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion\u201d) and AG \u00b6 7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless\nof citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) apply.\nThe government alleged separate foreign influence concerns because of\nApplicant\u2019s travel in recent years to Israel (SOR \u00b6 2.d).  AG \u00b6 7(i) applies where there is\n\u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country.\u201d There is no evidence of conduct that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i)\nwith the exception of his use of his Israeli passport to enter Israel as required of Israeli\ncitizens, including dual nationals. The security implications raised by his compliance\nwith this obligation of his Israeli citizenship are more appropriately covered under\nGuideline C. His travel to Israel has current security significance, but primarily because\nit confirms the ongoing relationships he has personally or through his spouse with family\nmembers in Israel, which is covered under AG \u00b6 7(a).\nThe demonstrated ties of affection and/or obligation that Applicant has personally\nor through his spouse for his siblings, and his stepchildren in Israel make it difficult to\nsatisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d). It must be noted that Israel\nand the U.S. have a close friendship. The U.S. is committed to Israel\u2019s security, to the\nextent of ensuring that Israel maintains a \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d in the region. Israel\nreceives preferential treatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and substantial\neconomic aid from the U.S. Yet, the interests of even the closest of allies are not always\ncompletely aligned. The U.S. is concerned about Israeli settlements, Israel\u2019s military\nsales to China, Israel\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property, and\nespionage-related cases implicating Israeli officials. Israeli military officials have been\nimplicated in economic espionage activity in the U.S. Israel was listed as one of the\nnations that aggressively targeted U.S. economic intelligence as recently as 2000.\nNothing about his siblings\u2019 or his stepchildren\u2019s occupations (project manager in\nurban renewal, psychologist/psychiatrist, architect) suggests any security, intelligence,\nor military duties. Nor is there any evidence contradicting Applicant\u2019s assertion that his\nrelatives are not connected to the Israeli government. Although his brother is currently a\nproject manager for a municipality, it is in a self-employed, consulting capacity. But the\nrisk of heightened influence is not fully mitigated where so little is known about his\n\nAG \u00b6 8(c) would apply to his relationship with his friend in Israel, which was not alleged in the SOR.\n6\n19\nfamily members\u2019 activities and associates, and his siblings are aware that he has\napplied for renewal of his security clearance.\nTerrorist attacks are a continuing threat in Israel, many of which are directed at\nAmerican interests, and it has not been confined to the West Bank and Gaza. However,\na distinction must be made between the risk to physical security that may exist and the\ntypes of concern that rise to the level of compromising Applicant\u2019s ability to safeguard\nnational security. Israel does not condone the indiscriminate acts of violence against its\ncitizens or tourists in Israel and strictly enforces security measures designed to\nminimize the risk presented by terrorism. Yet, given the strength of his ties to his family\nrelations in his native Israel, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 8(a) or AG \u00b6 8(c)(\"contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\").6\nConcerns that he could be effectively manipulated to help his relatives and/or\nIsrael in a way that could be contrary to the interests of the U.S. are amply mitigated,\nhowever, by his overwhelming commitment to his life in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d)).\nApplicant asserts an \u201cultimate\u201d loyalty to the U.S., where he has maintained his\npermanent residence for more than 30 years. He voluntarily acquired U.S. citizenship in\nMay 1982, and used a U.S. passport when traveling abroad except to Israel.  His use of\nhis Israeli passport after 2003 was always in conjunction with his U.S. passport and\nbecause of a requirement of Israeli law rather than of a preference for Israel.\nWhile Applicant married an Israeli citizen in 2003, he made it clear to her from\nthe start of their relationship that she would have to immigrate to the U.S. and she has\ndone so. He is firmly rooted in his community, where he is active in neighborhood\nactivities. He raised his daughter in the local public schools. Applicant has no financial\nassets in Israel, and his spouse\u2019s property in Israel will be inherited by her children.\nAlso, reflective of a strong commitment to the U.S. are his considerable technical\nand leadership contributions to his employer and the U.S. defense effort. Professional\ncolleagues and high ranking U.S. military officers familiar with his work, including as a\nmentor/thesis advisor for graduate students, have the highest regard for his judgment,\nethics, and dedication to the interests of the U.S. Both the former and present CEOs of\nthe laboratory are aware of his family ties to Israel and yet recommend him without\nreservation for continued access. Applicant has held a security clearance continuously\nsince 1978, and shown \u201cgreat sensitivity\u201d in the handling of classified information (Tr.\n61). He also understands that he has \u201ca very specific obligation to the United States\ngovernment because [he has] this security clearance and nobody is above that.\u201d (Tr.\n180). In other words, he is well aware of the requirement to report any attempts to gain\n\n20\nimproper influence and is willing to comply. Work references who know him, and the\ndemands associated with a security clearance, do not doubt his willingness or ability to\ncomply with the fiduciary obligations of a clearance. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe government alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified his December 2006\ne-QIP by responding negatively to whether he had an active foreign passport within the\nlast seven years. Applicant held a valid Israeli passport until October 15, 2006 (Ex. P),\nand the e-QIP contains a negative response to the passport inquiry.  Yet, he presented\ncredible evidence showing that he did not intentionally conceal his possession of the\nIsraeli passport. The e-QIP submitted to the government in December 2006 was\nprepared by someone in the laboratory's security office from an August 1999 SF 86 that\nApplicant had updated on its face. The updated August 1999 form (Ex. 21) contains an\naffirmative response to the foreign passport question and an expiration date of\n\"2006/10/15\" for his Israeli passport. Applicant denies any direct knowledge of how a\nnegative response came to be entered to the passport question on the e-QIP. He was\nperhaps negligent in failing to review the form carefully before he certified that all the\ninformation was correct, but he did not act to conceal his possession of a foreign\npassport. AG \u00b6 17(f) (\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of\nquestionable reliability\u201d) applies.\nConcerns were raised for the first time at the hearing about Applicant's failure to\ndisclose his employment with the Israeli government some 40 years ago. Both his\nAugust 1999 SF 86 (before and after it was updated) and his December 2006 e-QIP\ncontain negative responses to inquiry concerning whether he was now or had ever been\nemployed by a foreign government, firm, or agency. Applicant was unable to explain the\nnegative responses, given he had worked for the Israeli government after he was\ndischarged from the Israeli military. It is not clear what Applicant would have stood to\ngain from deliberately omitting his past foreign employment, given it is on his resume\n(Ex. D), and occurred some 40 years ago, its dated nature, and he listed his military\nservice for Israel on his security clearance applications (Ex. 1, 2, 21). Assuming\nApplicant had elected to not report his foreign employment that occurred before his\nimmigration to the U.S., it would not compel me to conclude that he deliberately falsified\nhis response to the passport question on his December 2006 e-QIP.\n \n\n21\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family\nmember and the interests of the U.S. Applicant maintains sufficiently close relations with\nhis siblings, and with his stepchildren (albeit with them primarily through his spouse) in\nIsrael, to raise a risk of undue foreign influence. His desire to visit them led him to\nactively exercise his Israeli citizenship through use of an Israeli passport to enter Israel,\nincluding after he had been apprised that his possession of an Israeli passport was of\nconcern to the government. Yet, by presenting his U.S. passport as well at the Israeli\nborder, and by taking no action to renew his Israeli passport, he showed a preference\nfor the U.S.\nHis preference for the U.S. is also exhibited in his marriage to his Israeli citizen\nspouse in the U.S. and in her immigration and pursuit of U.S. citizenship at his request. \nApplicant never sought an Israeli passport for his daughter, a native U.S. citizen, even\nthough she likely has derivative Israeli citizenship based on the Israeli citizenship of her\nparents at the time of her birth. He remains interested in the future of Israel but his ties\nare largely sentimental, especially when compared to the life he has built in the U.S.\nsince coming here for graduate school in 1971. The U.S. remains concerned about\nespionage activity directed against the U.S. to the benefit of Israel. At the same time,\nApplicant has had access to sensitive classified information since 1978 and shown\nhimself worthy of the trust placed in him. After carefully evaluating the evidence in light\nof the whole person concept, I find it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue his access to classified information.\n\n22\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the amended SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 48 years old and has worked for a defense contractor for about four yeas as a systems analyst technical writer/developer. He has four years of college but did not receive a degree. He held a security clearance for about two years starting in 1996. He is married with two children (Tr. 26-29, Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for National Security Position, dated June 19, 2006). Applicant's monthly net pay is approximately $4,200. He has about $3,900 in recurring monthly expenses leaving him with between $200 and $250 in monthly discretionary or disposable funds. Applicant recently turned over the family finances to his wife since she is much better at managing their finances than he has been (Tr. 51-57). Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Position in June 2006 as part of his employment with the defense contractor. In response to question 27 concerning his finances, he responded \"NO\" to question 27b asking if in the last seven years he had property repossessed. There were two cars repossessed as alleged in SOR allegations 1.c and 1.q. Applicant stated that he did not remember the car repossession in allegation 1.c, and did not think the car repossessed in allegation 1.q was covered by the question since he voluntarily returned the car to the dealer because of mechanical problems (Tr. 24-25, 33-34, 42-44, 55-56). Applicant responded \"NO\" to question27d asking if in the last seven years he had any unpaid judgments against him. There wa",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86) on \nJune 13, 2006.  On April 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations under Guideline F, for personal conduct under Guideline E, and \nfor criminal conduct under Guideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 2, 2008.  He admitted the 22 \nallegations under Guideline F, denied the three allegations under Guideline E, and the \none allegation under Guideline J.  He explained that he denied the allegations for \npersonal and criminal conduct because his false answers on his security clearance \napplication were unintended.  He requested a decision on the record without a hearing.  \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 18, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to paragraph E3.1.7 of the \nAdditional Procedural Guidance of the Directive.  Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on October 27, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on October 28, 2008.  \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2008, scheduling a hearing on \nNovember 20, 2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered six \nexhibits, marked government exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received \nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  The record was left open for \nApplicant to submit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted three documents \nmarked App. Ex. A-C.  The government did not object to the admission of the \ndocuments (See Gov. Ex. 7, Department Counsel Letter, dated December 8, 2008), and \nthe documents are admitted into the record.  DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on December 2, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has worked for a defense contractor for about four \nyeas as a systems analyst technical writer/developer.  He has four years of college but \ndid not receive a degree.  He held a security clearance for about two years starting in \n1996.  He is married with two children (Tr. 26-29, Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Position, dated June 19, 2006).  Applicant's monthly net pay is approximately \n$4,200.  He has about $3,900 in recurring monthly expenses leaving him with between \n$200 and $250 in monthly discretionary or disposable funds.  Applicant recently turned \nover the family finances to his wife since she is much better at managing their finances \nthan he has been (Tr. 51-57). \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Position in June 2006 \nas part of his employment with the defense contractor.  In response to question 27 \nconcerning his finances, he responded \"NO\" to question 27b asking if in the last seven \nyears he had property repossessed.  There were two cars repossessed as alleged in \nSOR allegations 1.c and 1.q.  Applicant stated that he did not remember the car \nrepossession in allegation 1.c, and did not think the car repossessed in allegation 1.q \nwas covered by the question since he voluntarily returned the car to the dealer because \nof mechanical problems (Tr. 24-25, 33-34, 42-44, 55-56).  Applicant responded \"NO\" to \nquestion27d asking if in the last seven years he had any unpaid judgments against him.  \nThere was a judgment alleged in allegation 1.r for past rent.  The judgment was sought \nagainst Applicant by a relative for rent due on a family house Applicant and his wife \nlived in while caring of his mother-in-law.  Applicant did not know of the judgment and \nhis relative had not informed him about the judgment (Tr. 24, 45-47, 55-56).  Applicant \nlisted one debt past due more than 180 days in response to question 28a.  However, he \nanswered \"NO\" to question 28b asking if he had any current debt more than 90 days \npast due.  Applicant meant to check \"YES'\" in response to this question but incorrectly \ncheck the \"NO\" box (Tr. 23-25, 56-57). \n \nCredit reports show and Applicant admits to the following delinquent debts; a \nstate tax lien for $254 for tax year 1994 (SOR 1.a); a delinquent debt to a bank charged \n\n \n3 \n \n \noff for $107 (SOR 1.b); a car repossession debt for $5,145.46 (SOR 1.c); a medical debt \nin collection for $635 (SOR 1.d); a medical debt in collection for $36 (SOR 1.e); a \ndelinquent account in collection for $1,248 (SOR 1.f); a credit card account in collection \nfor $624 (SOR 1.g); a medical debt in collection for $8,131 (SOR 1.h); a medical \naccount in collection for $95 (SOR 1.i); a television service account in collection for \n$585 (SOR 1.j); a bank account in collection for $1,546 (SOR 1.k); a medical account  in \ncollection for $100 (SOR 1.l); a bank account in collection for $578 (SOR 1.m); a \nmedical debt in collection for $650 (SOR 1.n); a collection account on a credit card for \n$662 (SOR 1.o); a delinquent bank account in collection for $756 (SOR 1.p); a car \nrepossession in collection for $6,497 (SOR 1.q); a judgment for past rent for $2,580 \n(SOR 1.r); a delinquent cell phone account in collection for $578 (SOR 1.s); a returned \ncheck in collection for $98 (SOR 1.t); a telephone account in collection for $403 (SOR \n1.u); and a delinquent credit card account in collection for $796 (SOR 1.v) (See Gov. \nEx. 3, Credit Report, dated February 27, 2007; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit Report, dated October \n18, 2007; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit Report, dated February 5, 2008; Gov. Ex. 6, Credit Report, \ndated October 21, 2008).  Applicant admitted all of the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR (See Response to SOR, dated October 2, 2008). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.a is for state taxes owed from tax year 1994.  Applicant \nstated that the taxes were paid and the debt satisfied.  He contacted the state and was \ninformed no tax debt was owed.  However, he provided no proof of payment or a \nstatement of satisfaction of the debt from the state (Tr. 31-32).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.b is a collection account to a bank.  Applicant stated he \nsent a check in partial payment to the bank but it was returned.  He tried to contact the \nbank but was unsuccessful (Tr. 32-33, See, Check 189 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to \nInterrogatory, dated December 10, 2007).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.c is for a repossessed car.  Applicant made a recent \n$200 payment on this debt but has not made any other payments (Tr. 33-34; See, \nCheck 187 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007).   \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.d and 1.e are to the same medical provider for medical \ndebts in collection of $635 and $36.  Applicant has made no payments on these debts \nbut does intend to pay them (Tr. 34-36). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.f is for a credit card in collection.  Applicant sent $100 in \npartial payment which was rejected by the creditor who wanted full payment. (Tr. 36; \nSee, Check 184 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.g is for a credit card in collection.  Applicant sent a check \nfor $100 in partial payment.  He does not remember if the check cleared his bank (Tr. \n36-37; See, Check 185 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, \n2007 \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1. h for $8.131, 1.l for $100, and 1.n for $650 are medical \ndebt for Applicant's medical treatment.  He has not made any payments on these \naccounts.  He was unable to pay them when they were incurred because he was \nunemployed (Tr. 37-39). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.i is a medical debt in collection for $95.  Applicant does \nnot know what doctor treated him and he disputes the debt.  He has not made any \ninquires to determine the origin of the debt (Tr. 39-40). \n \nDelinquent debt 1.j for $585 is for television satellite service.  Applicant sent a \nrecent $100 payment for this debt but it was returned because the creditor wanted full \npayment (Tr. 40-41; See, Check 180 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated \nDecember 10, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.k is a collection account for a $1,546 credit card.  \nApplicant recently sent a $100 partial payment that was accepted (Tr. 41; See, Check \n183 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.m for $576 and 1.p for $756 are for delinquent accounts \nto the same bank.  Applicant recently sent a partial payment of $200 that did not clear \nhis bank account.  He has not been able to get details on the accounts (Tr. 41-42; See, \nCheck 179 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.o is for a credit card in collection for $662.  Applicant \nrecently sent a partial payment of $30 which was accepted.  He made a $50 payment \non the account recently.  He has not made any other payments (Tr. 42, See, Check 182 \nat Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007; App. Ex. A, Money \nGram, dated December 5, 2008).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.q is for a voluntary car repossession which he returned to \nthe dealer for mechanical problems.  He recently made a $150 payment on the account \nthat was accepted.  He has made no other payments on this account (Tr. 42-44; See, \nCheck 186 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.r is for a judgment of $2,580 for rent on a family home he \nand his wife lived in while taking care of his wife's parents.  Applicant did not think he \nhad to pay rent but a relative filed the judgment because he did not pay rent.  He did not \nknow of the judgment until he received the SOR.  He recently made a $300 partial \npayment to the relative which was returned.  The relative told Applicant that the \npayment had to be sent to the court to satisfy the judgment.  Applicant has not yet made \na payment to the court.  He believes in the past he has made payments to the relative \ntotaling about $600.  However, he has no proof of payment or receipts (Tr. 45-47; See, \nCheck 177 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.s is for a telephone bill in collection for $578.  Applicant \nsent a $200 payment on the account.  He recently made a payment of $174 that paid \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe account in full (Tr. 47-48; See, Check 178 at Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatory, \ndated December 10, 2007; App. Ex. C, Money gram, dated December 5, 2008). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.t is for a returned check of $98.  Applicant does not \nbelieve he owes this debt.  He has not made any inquiry about the account or any \npayments (Tr. 48-49). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.u is for a home telephone debt of $403 that Applicant \nbelieves he paid in full when he made a recent payment of $100.  He was unable to \nprovide any other information from the creditor (Tr. 49-50; See, Check 188 at Gov. Ex. \n2, Answers to Interrogatory, dated December 10, 2007).   \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.v is for a credit card in collection for $796.  He believes \nhe made a partial payment to the creditor.  He recently made a payment of $50 on this \naccount (Tr. 50; App. Ex. B, Money gram, dated December 5, 2008).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed in credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations\".  Applicant had difficulty meeting his financial obligations \nbecause of lack of consistent work as a defense contractor.   \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\", and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\"  Applicant has not presented information to show that his \ndelinquent debts have been paid or satisfied.  He has recently made some token partial \n\n \n7 \n \n \npayments, some of which were accepted by the creditor and some that were not \naccepted.  Only one debt seems to have been paid in full.  He still has significant \ncurrent delinquent debts from loans, repossessions, credit cards, telephone and cable \nbills, and medical debts.  Applicant stated he was not able to pay his debts because he \nhas not been steadily employed.  However, he presented no information to show how \nhis lack of steady work affected his finances or caused financial problems.  He has not \npresented any information to show his financial problems will not recur.  These two \nmitigating condition do not apply.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under \ncontrol\" does not apply.  Applicant did not present any information on any financial \ncounseling he has received.  He has not presented any information to establish that his \nfinances are under control. \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" does not applies.  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded.  Applicant has no concrete plan for how he will pay his delinquent debts.  He \nrecently sent checks to some of his creditors, but this is not a plan.  Some payments \nwere accepted, some were rejected because full payment was needed, and some \nApplicant is not even sure cleared his bank account.  Only one debt has been paid.  He \nhas not contacted creditors to arrange acceptable conditions for paying the debts.  In \nshort, he has no plan of attack to stabilize his debts and be current with his payments.  \nHe has not made any consistent payments on the debts.  He has not indicated a strong \ndesire to pay the debts, and thus has not shown a good-faith effort to pay them.  \nApplicant's actions do not establish that he is financially responsible.  He has not \nmitigated security concerns raised by his financial situation. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information.  \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s incomplete answers on his \nsecurity clearance application concerning financial issues of judgments and past due \ndebts raises a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC \n\n \n8 \n \n \nDC) AG \u00b6 16(a) \"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and \nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness\". \n \n \nApplicant denied intentional falsification.  He responded to the financial questions \non the application as best he could.  He knew of one debt more than 180 days past due \nand listed it.  He meant to check the \"YES\" box for debts currently due over 90 days but \ninadvertently checked the wrong box.  He did not know of the judgment filed by a \nrelative for past due rent.  He did not remember one of the car repossessions.  The \nother car repossession he did not believe had to be listed because the car was \nvoluntarily returned to the dealer for mechanical problems.  Applicant is not clear on the \nstate of his financial matters and completed the security clearance application as best \nhe could.  While there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the \ngovernment when applying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or \ninaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be deliberate and \nmaterial.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Since Applicant listed the \nfinancial concerns as he knew them when completing the application, his failure to list \nthe delinquent debts, judgment, and repossessions was not knowing and willful.  \nApplicant established he did not deliberately provide false information on the security \nclearance application with intent to deceive.  I find for Appellant as to Personal Conduct.  \nSince Applicant did not deliberately provide false information on his security clearance \napplication, there is no violation of federal criminal law and no criminal conduct security \nconcern.  Guideline J is also found in favor of Applicant. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant does not have a concrete \nplan for paying his delinquent debts.  He made some payments by check.  Some were \nnot even accepted.  He has significant outstanding debts that he has no means or plans \nto resolve.  Applicant has not established that he is current on his debts or paying past \ndue obligations.  Applicant's lack of concrete management of his finances indicates poor \nself control, lack of judgment, and responsible action.  He is financially overextended, \nand his finances create a security concern.  He did not provide incomplete information \non his security clearance application with the intent to deceive.  Overall, on balance the \nrecord evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations, but has \nmitigated security concerns for personal conduct and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.r: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.t - 1.v \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 25, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 30, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\nOctober 22, 2008\n\nResponse to the SOR, dated June 30, 2008.\n1\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Application (S-86)) at 2, 3, 6-9; Tr. 28-29, 31, 57-58, 61.\n2\n2\njudge. DOHA received the request on July 3, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared\nto proceed on July 14, 2008, and DOHA assigned this case to another judge on August\n8, 2008. Because of a conflict of interest, I received the case assignment on August 12,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 2, 2008, which Applicant\nreceived on September 11, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on September\n30, 2008. The government offered three exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received\nand admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and two witnesses testified on\nhis behalf. He did not submit any exhibits for admission into the record. The record\nclosed on September 30, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nOctober 7, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Taiwan and the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). (Tr. 10-12.)\nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence, but were\nincluded in the record as Administrative Exhibits I through XVIII. The facts\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 30, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 49 years old, works as senior staff research engineer, scientist\nand mathematician for a Department of Defense contractor. He has worked for this\nemployer for nine years. During these years, Applicant has designed and developed\nmany inventions. He holds one United States (U.S.) Patent, filed more that 85 invention\ndisclosures, and has 22 pending patent applications.\nApplicant, who was born in Taiwan, received his bachelor\u2019s degree from a\nuniversity in Taiwan in 1981. After graduation, he served a mandatory two years in the\nTaiwan military. In 1983, he emigrated to the U.S. to attend graduate school at a major\nuniversity. He received a masters degree in 1985 and a Ph.D. in 1988 from this\nuniversity. He became a U.S. citizen in May 1996. He holds a U.S. passport and did,\nsimultaneously, hold a Taiwanese passport for a short time. He destroyed his\nTaiwanese passport.  \n2\n\nGE 1, supra  note 2, at 14-15, 17; Tr. 59-60.\n3\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 12-13, 16-17: Tr. 30, 46, 58, 60, 63-65. \n4\nGE 1, supra note 2, at 19-16; GE 2 (Interrogatories and Applicants answers) at 3-4, 7; Tr. 38-43, 72-73, 78,\n5\n80.\n3\nApplicant married his first wife, a U.S. citizen who was also born and raised in\nTaiwan, in 1984. They separated in 1998 and divorced in 2001. To his knowledge his\nex-wife resides in the U.S. His daughter from this marriage is 23 years old and a U.S.\nborn citizen, residing in the U.S.3\nFollowing his separation from his wife, an old friend from his military service\nintroduced Applicant to his current wife. At the time of their introduction, she worked as\nan accountant for a U.S. company in Beijing, China. Their relationship started through\ne-mail communications followed by telephone calls. In 2000, he traveled to the PRC to\nmeet his future wife and her family. He traveled to the PRC twice more, in 2001 and\n2002, as part of his courtship of her. When she received her K-1 visa in 2003, she\nemigrated to the U.S. They married in March 2003, days after she arrived in the U.S. He\nadvised his office of his marriage. His wife has a permanent green card and plans on\nbecoming a U.S. citizen when she is eligible. Their son was born in the U.S. in 2004 and\nis a U.S. citizen, residing with them in the U.S. His wife knows little about his job duties,\nbut does know that he holds a security clearance.4\nApplicant\u2019s parents are 74 years old, citizens of Taiwan and live in Taiwan. His\nfather is a retired builder and his mother was a homemaker. His father has some health\nissues. His mother is in very poor health as a result of her diabetes. His parents live off\ntheir savings. They do not received a government retirement income, but receive health\ncare through the Taiwanese government\u2019s universal health care program. His parents\nare not involved in politics and do not have contact with the Taiwanese government.\nApplicant\u2019s parents last visited him in the U.S. in 1997, when their health was better. He\nvisited his parents in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008. His recent visits\nhave been because of his mother\u2019s declining health. Except for his visit in 2006,\nApplicant traveled only on his U.S. passport. In 2006, he traveled on both his U.S. and\nnewly issued Taiwanese passport. He destroyed the Taiwanese passport in April 2007.\nWhen he is in Taiwan, he does not report his presence to the police or any other\ngovernment  official. He has not had any contacts with government officials while in\nTaiwan. He talks with his father by telephone twice a week, but he does not talk with his\nmother any more because she is on a feeding tube.5\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. She is married with two\nchildren and works as an elementary teacher for the local government. His brother is a\nU.S. citizen, residing in the U.S. He talks with his sister every two to three weeks and\nvisits with her when he is in Taiwan. In 2006, he renewed an identification (ID) card\nissued by the Taiwan government at the request of his father. His father owns several\npieces of land, one of which he believes is titled in his name. His father pays the taxes\n\nResponse to SOR at 4; Tr. at 31-34, 36-37, 43, 78- 80.\n6\nTr. at 43-52, 65-71.\n7\nId. at 85-101.\n8\nId. at 104-112.\n9\n4\nand all cost of upkeep on this land. His father needed the ID to get a power of attorney\nto sell the land, which may be in Applicant\u2019s name. The ID card has expired since\nApplicant does not live in Taiwan.   \n6\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, and two brothers-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of the PRC. He met his in-laws during his travels to the PRC while courting his\nwife. Since their marriage, he and his wife have return to the PRC once, in 2005. His in-\nlaws have visited he and his family in the U.S. twice, one time for a year. His father-in-\nlaw and mother-in-law are retired, and he believes they receive a government pension.\nOne brother-in-law works for a city government in the PRC and the other brother-in-law\nis unemployed. His wife talks with her parents two to three times a week and to her\nelder brother once a month. She talks with her younger brother less often. His contacts\nwith his in-laws are infrequent.  When he visited the PRC and his in-laws, he did not\nregister with the police nor was he approached by any government officials. His wife\u2019s\nfamily did not request information about his job and they are not involved in politics or\ngovernment activity. He does not know if his in-laws have any knowledge about his job\nduties or the fact he has a security clearance.7\nApplicant\u2019s former long-time supervisor, who hired applicant in 1999, worked\nclosely with Applicant for eight years. He describes Applicant as a very bright, top-notch\nmathematician who is very good and quick at solving challenging problems with\ninnovative approaches. Applicant has an inquisitive mind and enjoys life. He has\npublished papers and a lot of responsibility at work. He knows that Applicant served in\nthe Taiwanese military and traveled to the PRC several times. He knew as soon as\nApplicant married in 2003 and has met his wife. He and Applicant socialize occasionally\noutside of the office. He trusts Applicant and recommends him for a security clearance.8\nA long time friend and former co-worker, who is a retired Navy captain, testified\non behalf of Applicant. He worked with Applicant between 1996 and 1999. Since this\ntime, they have remained good friends. He plays ping-pong with Applicant on a regular\nbasis. They visit each other\u2019s homes frequently. He has met his wives and children. He\nis not aware of any problems from Applicant\u2019s past trips to Taiwan and the PRC. He\ndescribes Applicant as extremely intelligent and very competent. He recommends\nApplicant for a clearance.9\nApplicant has not purchased any property in Taiwan nor does he have any\nfinancial assets or investments in Taiwan or the PRC. He owns a house in the U.S., his\n\nId. at 81-83; GE 2, supra note 2, at 21.\n10\n5\nbank accounts are in the U.S., he purchases U.S. savings bonds, and has a retirement\ninvestment account in the U.S.  \n10\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Taiwan is a multiparty\ndemocracy, a U.S. ally, and a major trading partner. Its Constitution provides its citizens\nwith many rights similar to those provided to U.S. citizens. It has a good human rights\nrecord. It maintains a large military establishment whose primary mission is the defense\nof Taiwan against the Peoples Republic of China. The Taiwan Relations Act, 22 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 3301-3316, is the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the U.S. and\nTaiwan. On the other hand, Taiwan is an active collector of defense, medical, economic,\nand computer information through industrial espionage. There are reports of cases\ninvolving the export of certain devices to Taiwan without approval of the Department of\nCommerce.\nThe PRC is an authoritarian, communist party-led state. Human rights violations\ncontinue to be problematic. Concerns regarding the PRC\u2019s weapons development, theft\nof classified technology information between 1979 and 1999, and industrial espionage\nactivities remain. The PRC continues to have active intelligence operations in the U.S.,\nwhich seek to obtain military and industrial secrets through Americans of Chinese\nancestry. On the other hand, the PRC supports the U.S.\u2019s anti-terrorism position and\nactivities. The U.S. and the PRC have developed joint trade agreements, resulting in the\nsale of goods to each other, and work together on environmental issues. The PCR\nenjoys a most favored nation status in trading with the U.S. The PRC has opened its\ndoors to outside investment.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n11\nAppeals  Appeal Board, which under its decisional law does not review a case de novo. See ISCR Case No.\n07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). The Supreme Court\nin United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667.m 690 (198) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 (1974), the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d And, in United States v. First City\nNational Bank, this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the court should make\nan independent determination of the issues\u201d and should \u201cnot . . . give any special weight to\nthe [prior] determination of\u201d the administrative agency.\n(internal footnotes omitted). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board criticized\nthe administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and then\ndecided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations and\nultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes witness\ncredibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-11(App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n2006)(Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to reverse hearing-level\njudicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial error) and ISCR Case\nNo. 07-03307 (App. Bd. Sept. 29, 2008).\n6\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.11\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n7\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nIn 2006, at the request of his father, Applicant obtained an ID card issued by the\nTaiwanese government when he was visiting Taiwan. His father requested Applicant\nobtain the ID so he could obtain a power of attorney to sell a piece of land owned by\nApplicant\u2019s father, but had been titled in Applicant\u2019s name by his father. His father paid\nall the taxes and expenses related to up keeping this land. Applicant did not use the ID\ncard to obtain any benefits of Taiwanese citizenship or to show a preference for Taiwan\nover the U.S. Rather, his father needed the ID card to obtain a power of attorney to sell\na piece of land. The card expired after 6 months. The government has not established a\nsecurity concern under disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10. Guideline C is found in favor of\nApplicant.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n\n8\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His wife\u2019s\nparents and two brothers are citizens and residents of the PRC. Both Applicant and his\nwife maintain a normal familial relationship with their parents and siblings. They talk by\ninternet telephone with their family members on a regular basis. Applicant has visited\nhis parents in Taiwan seven times since 2000 and visited the PRC four times since\n2000. These relationships are not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. The government must establish that these family relationships create a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nor would create a potential conflict of interest between his obligations to protect\nsensitive information and his desire to help his family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the governments of the\nTaiwan and the PRC. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008).\nConcerning the intelligence gathering activities of the PRC, in ISCR Case No. 07-02485\n(App. Bd. May 9, 2008) the Appeal Board agreed with the government\u2019s argument,\nconcluding that substantial evidence of a security risk exists when an Applicant has\nfamily members living in the PRC because the PRC is an active collector of intelligence\nand sensitive proprietary information from U.S. defense contractors; considers U.S.\ncitizens of Chinese ancestry to be \u201cprime intelligence targets\u201d; and monitors its citizens\u2019\ntelephone, fax and e-mail communications. The risk that an Applicant could be targeted\nfor manipulation or induced into compromising classified information is real, not\ntheoretical. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s relationship and contacts with her family in the PRC raise\na heightened risk that the government of the PRC will use her family members to\npressure him into revealing classified information. Because of his extensive contacts\nwith his parents and sister and his frequent travels to Taiwan, there is a heightened risk\nthat Applicant will be targeted. The government has established its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n7(a) and (b).\nIn deciding if Applicant has submitted evidence of mitigation, under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I\nmust consider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\n\n9\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider if\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with his family members is not a basis to deny\nhim a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires more than\nstatements about the limited scope of his conversations and contacts with his wife\u2019s\nfamily members. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). Applicant\u2019s\nfather-in-law and mother-in-law are retired and depend upon the government of the\nPRC to provide their retirement benefit. Applicant traveled to the PRC three times in the\nlast eight years to visit his wife and family members before they were married, and once\nsince their marriage five years ago. His wife continues to speak with her parents and\nbrothers on a regular basis. In light of the intelligence activities of the PRC directed to\nthe U.S. through Americans of Chinese ancestry, Applicant has not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8 (a) and (b) as to his in-laws. However,\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S, his long-standing ties to the U.S and Taiwan\u2019s\nclose relationship with the U.S., even though it is an active collector of industrial\ninformation, there is no conflict of interest for Applicant as a result of his family ties in\nTaiwan. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to his family\ncontacts.\n \nFinally, under AG \u00b6 8(c), I must consider if the \u201ccontact or communication with\nforeign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents\nand sister are not infrequent and casual, nor are his wife\u2019s contacts with her family\ninfrequent and casual. Thus, Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 8(c). None of the remaining mitigating conditions are applicable in this case.\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under AG \u00b6 6.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n10\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant came to the U.S. 25 years\nago as a graduate student. Following his graduation, he decided to remain in the U.S.\nHis first wife, his brother and his two children are citizens and residents of the U.S.\nThere is no security concern regarding his relationship with these family members.\nApplicant is a highly respected mathematician and scientist. Through his commendable\nefforts and as a result of his sharp intellect, he has developed many inventions which\nare of great assistance to the U.S. His inventions are not classified works for security\nclearance purposes, but are the proprietary work of his employer. His colleagues trust\nhim based on their many years of working with him and/or an ongoing personal\nrelationship. They view him as highly skilled and an asset to his employer and the U.S.\nHis wife intends to become a U.S. citizen when she is eligible. He is living the American\ndream. He have a good income, is saving for his retirement, and raising his son in the\nAmerican way of life. He abides by the laws and manage his finances. He is a highly\nrespected individual in his profession and at his job. Applicant\u2019s managers and co-\nworkers praise his worth ethic and character. The Appeal Board has held that all these\nhighly admirable qualities are not enough to mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns when an Applicant has family ties to the PRC. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485\n(App. Bd. May 9, 2008).\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under the foreign influence\nguideline, although he mitigated the foreign preference security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On February 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 28, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant filed his notice of appeal on August 10, 2008.  By letter dated August 13, 2008,\nApplicant was informed that his written appeal brief had to be received by the Appeal Board no later\nthan September 11, 2008.  See Directive E3.1.30.  On September 10, 2008, the Board received a fax\nfrom Applicant stating that he was \u201caway until 15 September 2008, with limited connectivity.\u201d  The\nBoard construed that communication as a request for additional time, and notified Applicant by letter\ndated September 10, 2008, that his deadline for filing his appeal brief was rescheduled to October\n10, 2008.  By letter dated October 15, 2008, the Board granted Applicant an additional extension\nuntil November 4, 2008, based on an October 10, 2008 letter from Applicant in which he stated, in\npart, that he was having difficulty understanding the information on DOHA\u2019s website.  The Board\u2019s\nOctober 15, 2008 letter outlined DOHA\u2019s general procedures and included, as an enclosure, a second\ncopy of the Appeal Instructions.  Applicant was also informed that no component of DOHA could\nassist him in drafting his appeal brief, but he was otherwise permitted to seek assistance.  \nOn November 4, 2008, the Appeal Board received a letter from Applicant which it construed\nas an appeal brief requesting that the Judge\u2019s decision be reversed.  The Board then allowed the non-\nappealing party (Department Counsel) the requisite 20 days to file a reply brief.  The Board\nsubsequently received a letter from Applicant, dated November 24, 2008, raising additional issues.\nThe Board deems the November 24, 2008 letter to be untimely, and will not consider the issues\nraised therein.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant had accumulated 14 debts totaling approximately\n$89,273.  Decision at 2.  The Judge found that: \u201cNone of the debts alleged in the SOR were resolved\nas of the date of the hearing, and no payments had been made on any of the debts.\u201d  Id.  In light of\nthe foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still\nongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 28, 2008; answered it \non March 15, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on April 4, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nApril 25, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on April 29, 2008. DOHA issued a \nhearing notice on May 9, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 28, 2008. On May 16, \n2008 Applicant requested a continuance to enable him to gather documentary evidence, \nand I granted his request on the same day. Applicant\u2019s request and my ruling are \nattached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX I).  \n \nDOHA issued a second notice of hearing on May 29, 2008, rescheduling the \nhearing for June 17, 2008. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which \nwere admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open \nuntil July 2, 2008, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. Applicant \ntimely submitted AX F, and it was admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nresponse to AX F is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit II. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 26, 2008. The record closed on July 2, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR and \noffered explanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old multimedia producer for a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since November 2006. He also works part-time as a \nself-employed multimedia producer. He has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant has been married since June 2005. In May 2007, his spouse was \nseriously injured in a boating accident and has been unable to work (GX 5 at 2; AX C). \nEven with health insurance, Applicant has incurred significant medical expenses for the \ncare and treatment of his spouse. \n \n \nApplicant testified he began having financial problems in 1997 or 1998, when he \nworked as a salesman for a computer retailer. After the retailer went out of business, \nApplicant worked for his father for eight years and was able to resolve his debts (Tr. 36-\n37). When the market declined and Applicant started making less money, he again \nstarted having financial problems (Tr. 37). \n \n \nApplicant accumulated the 14 debts alleged in the SOR, totaling about $89,273, \nby purchasing media equipment for his part-time business (GX 4 at 2). Most of the \ndebts became delinquent in late 2005, before his spouse\u2019s boating accident, except for \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.h, which became delinquent in early 2007. None \nof the debts alleged in the SOR were resolved as of the date of the hearing, and no \npayments had been made on any of the debts.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified he had several settlement offers pending that he would resolve \nin 10 to15 days. He presented documentary evidence that one debt had been settled, \nbut he could not connect the evidence to any debts alleged in the SOR (AX B; Tr. 51-\n53). He did not present any evidence of settlements in his post-hearing submission. He \npresented one post-hearing document (AX F) from his landlord, showing that he and his \nspouse have been tenants since July 2006 and have never been late in paying their \nrent. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s biweekly net pay is about $1,840 (Tr. 45). He presented a budget \nworksheet at the hearing (AX A), listing his monthly net income as between $3,650 and \n$3,700, and itemizing monthly expenses totaling $3,650, leaving no net remainder. His \nmonthly budget includes some apparently discretionary items such as cable/internet \n($120), books and magazines ($50), movies and concerts ($20), and hobbies ($100). \nNo expenses attributable to his part-time business are included. He testified he has \ncanceled his credit cards and now pays cash for all his purchases (Tr. 40-41). \n \n \nApplicant consulted with a debt counselor in 2006 and a bankruptcy attorney in \n2007, but he took no action after these consultations. He testified he suspected his \ninability to manage his finances might be due to attention deficit disorder, and that he \nintend to undergo evaluation (AX D and E; Tr. 39, 43). He presented no evidence at the \nhearing or in his post-hearing submission reflecting a diagnosis of attention deficit \ndisorder. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n4 \n \n \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling about $89,273. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history \nof not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).   \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@ If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established, \nbecause Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that are not resolved. None of the \ndebts appear to have been caused by unusual circumstances. Applicant\u2019s long history \nof overspending casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are partially the result of business downturns, but he neglected to adjust his \nspending habits when they occurred. His medical expenses and loss of a second \nincome after his spouse\u2019s injury were beyond his control, but they occurred after the \ndebts alleged in the SOR already were delinquent. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas consulted with a debt counselor and a bankruptcy attorney; but he has taken no \naction, and his financial problems are not under control. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nApplicant presented no evidence of payment, compromise, or settlement of any debts \nalleged in the SOR. I conclude this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is intelligent, well-educated, and articulate, but he seems unable to \nadjust his spending to his income. He was personable, sincere, and candid at the \nhearing, but he seems to be drifting through life, with no plan for resolving his financial \nproblems. He is understandably distracted and concerned by his spouse\u2019s serious \ninjuries, but they occurred after the debts alleged in the SOR were already delinquent. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant married a U.S. service member and became a naturalized U.S. citizen\nduring the four and a half years they lived in the U.S. They are now separated, pending\ndivorce, and she lives and works in Germany, where she retains dual citizenship, holds\nan active passport, and votes. All of her immediate family and most of her assets are in\nGermany. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 20,\n2005. On April 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines C and B.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n1\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nSeptember 22, 2008\n\nItem 3.\n2\nThe government submitted five items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4 at 1 through 4.\n4\nItem 3 at 2; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 7, 8, 10-11, 14.\n5\nItem 3 at 1, 2; Item 4 at 5-6; Item 5 at 4-6, 10.\n6\n2\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated, notarized letter, and requested that\nher case be decided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a\nhearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 24,\n2\n2008. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to\n3\nApplicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging\nreceipt of her copy of the FORM on July 8, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. She\nprovided no further response to the FORM within the 30-day period she was given to do\nso, did not request additional time to respond, and made no objection to consideration\nof any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 15, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She was born and\nraised in Germany. In 1997, she married a U.S. service member who was serving there.\nThey moved to and lived in the U.S. from July 1998 to March 2003, and she became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen in March 2002. In 2003, she and her husband separated,\npending divorce. She moved back to Germany, and obtained her present job in April of\nthat year, working for the same company that had employed her in the U.S. from\nJanuary 2000 through February 2003.4\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the truth of all the factual\nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e and 2.a through 2.c. Applicant retained her\nGerman citizenship, and obtained a German passport in 2007 with a 2017 expiration\ndate to replace her 1997 German passport that expired in 2007. She is not willing to\nrenounce her German citizenship or to surrender her German passport, and professes\nongoing loyalty to Germany. She regularly voted in German elections both before\nmoving to the U.S. and since her return.  She has about $260,000 in savings and\n5\ninherited assets in German financial institutions, and about $20,000 in a U.S. savings\naccount. Her mother, step-father, sister, aunt and niece are all German citizens and\nresidents, as are the majority of her friends and acquaintances. Neither she nor any of\nher family members have ever been affiliated with the German or another foreign\ngovernment.  \n6\n\nDepartment Counsel incorrectly identified this disqualifying condition as \u201cDC 10(a)(2).\u201d (FORM at 4.) That\n7\nprovision actually concerns foreign military service. \n3\nDepartment Counsel neither sought administrative notice nor submitted any\nevidence concerning the nature of Germany\u2019s government or its relations with the U.S.\nthat would indicate any heightened risk of foreign exploitation. Department Counsel\u2019s\nreliance on interpretations of Appeal Board precedents that pre-dated the substantial\nrevision of the Guideline B disqualifying conditions in the current AG is unpersuasive.\nSimilarly, her assertion that Guideline C security concerns arise under AG \u00b6 10(a)(4)  is\n7\nunsupported. This disqualifying condition requires \u201cresidence in a foreign country to\nmeet citizenship requirements,\u201d and does not apply to Applicant who is a German\ncitizen by birth. Since Applicant elected a determination on the written record, no in-\nperson evaluation of her character or credibility was possible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n\n4\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 security concerns involving foreign preference arise because,\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other\nsuch benefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business interests in\nanother country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an\nAmerican citizen;\n\n5\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as\nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United\nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nApplicant\u2019s actions in obtaining and maintaining her currently valid German\npassport in 2007 raise security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(b) above. She was\nborn a German citizen, but became a U.S. citizen in 2002. Obtaining the German\npassport in 2007 was an action to obtain recognition of her continuing German\ncitizenship by the German government. She intends to continue possession and use of\nher German passport. Her past and intended future voting in German elections raises\npotential concerns under AG \u00b6 10(a)(7) as well. Finally, her declaration of ongoing\nloyalty to Germany, refusal to renounce dual citizenship, and resumption of residence\nand employment there after separation from her U.S. citizen husband all show ongoing\nallegiance to Germany, as contemplated under AG \u00b6 10(d). \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate these security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\nApplicant neither asserted nor provided any evidence to support application of any of\nthese potentially mitigating conditions. While she apparently wants to maintain her U.S.\ncitizenship as well, she resumed residence, employment, and the full exercise of the\nrights, privileges and obligations of her German citizenship upon separation from her\nAmerican husband in 2003. She is unwilling to surrender or invalidate her German\npassport and her family, friends, and financial assets are predominantly in Germany.\n\n6\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two\nof them: \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion;\u201d and \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government,\nor country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign\nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d There is no evidence on which\nto base any conclusion that the German government would attempt to exploit or coerce\nApplicant to disclose protected information based on her family or property there. Other\nthan their mere presence in Germany, nothing about Applicant\u2019s contacts with her family\nand friends suggests any heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion. AG \u00b6 7(a) is not supported by the record. However,\nApplicant\u2019s residence, together with that of her close family members and substantial\nproperty in Germany create a potential conflict of interest between her obligation to\nprotect sensitive information and desire to help her native country. Should she obtain\nsensitive U.S. information that she felt would be of value to the German government,\nher substantial ties there would generate such a conflict.  Thus, legitimate security\nconcerns are raised under AG \u00b6 7(b).    \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those with\npotential application in this case are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.; and\n\n7\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nApplicant\u2019s relationships with her family in Germany are close and important to\nher, and she has substantial financial investments there. None of her family members\nhave any government connection, or are in any position to benefit from her compromise\nof protected information. Particularly since Germany is a close ally with no record of\ntargeting U.S. citizens for protected information, it not very likely that Applicant would be\nput in a position of having to choose between any foreign interests and those of the U.S.\nHowever, should such potential conflict of interest arise, her relative ties to Germany\nand the U.S. are such that she could not necessarily be expected to resolve it in favor of\nthe U.S. interest.  This establishes some mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), but not under AG \u00b6\n8(b). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for her choices and conduct. After a relatively brief period of residence in\nthe U.S., accompanying her new husband due to military reassignment, she separated\nfrom him and returned to live and work in Germany where her family and most of her\nfriends reside. She intends to retain and exercise her rights, privileges and\nresponsibilities as a German citizen, and professes her continuing loyalty to her native\ncountry. None of this is either improper or unusual. However, it establishes legitimate\nforeign preference and foreign influence security concerns that she carries the burden\n\n8\nof proof to rebut or mitigate. She offered no other evidence about her character or\nresponsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to make their continuation less\nlikely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her foreign preference\nand foreign influence. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \n  Pamela Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant:  Mr. Scott Harris, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nOn June 4, 2007, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 30, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 24, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 15, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On April 9, 2008, DOHA assigned the case to \nme and issued a Notice of Hearing on May 7, 2008. The case was heard on May 29, \n2008, as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibit (AE) A into evidence \nwithout objection.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until June 13, \n2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On June 3, \n2008, Applicant submitted an exhibit that I marked as AE B and admitted into the record \nwithout objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJune 11, 2008.  In early July 2008, I received additional documents from Applicant that I \nmarked AE C and D. On July 9, 2008, Department Counsel indicated that he had no \nobjection to those documents and I admitted them into the record.                                                          \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f of the SOR, and provided additional explanations in support of her \nrequest for a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old and married. She has one child from a former marriage, \nage 13, and two stepchildren, ages 15 and 20. Her father was in the Air Force for 20 \nyears and her oldest son recently joined the Navy. (AE A). In November 2003, she \nbegan working part-time for a federal contractor. In October 2006, she became a full-\ntime employee as a contract administrator.  \n \n \nPrior to this position, Applicant was unemployed for five months, having been laid \noff in May 2003 from a job where she worked for five years. At the time of the layoff, she \nwas earning $32,000 annually. She received unemployment compensation of \napproximately $1,000 per month until she started her current job. Around the same \ntime, her husband lost his $40,000 job. He then worked in his own business for the next \ncouple years, until he obtained a full-time position in August 2007. He earns $9.75 per \nhour. He is looking for a higher paying position. (AE A; Tr. 28-30).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal representative testified. He is Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor \nand a founding partner in the company that employs her. He also operates as the \nfacilities security officer for the company and holds a Top secret security clearance. He \nhas known Applicant since she started with his company in November 2003. Her \nprevious employer recommended her to him. He is aware of the circumstances \nunderlying her layoff and the financial hardship it created for her family. He was \nimmediately impressed by her performance, and as a result, the company loaned her \n$10,000 in October 2006 to purchase a car after her old vehicle broke down. She paid \noff the loan in October 2007. As the company has developed, her contract \nadministrator\u2019s duties have grown and she has received salary increases. In October \n2007, she received a promotion that increased her salary to $35,000. The company \nprovides generous health benefits for her family. (AE A). He considers her to be a \nmodel employee. He also knows her family and recognizes her parenting skills. He \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nnoted that she drives a 100 miles a day to take her child to a special school. He thinks \nvery highly of her. (Tr. 15-26). \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to pay five delinquent debts and one \njudgment, totaling $24,255. However, the debt listed in \u00b6 1.e is the same debt \nreferenced in \u00b6 1.f, resulting in a total debt amount of $15,620. The status of those five \ndebts is as follows: \n \n1. The $213 debt listed in \u00b6 1.a was paid in February 2008. (AE A at 24). \n \n2. The $5,467 debt listed in \u00b6 1.b is unpaid and is owned to a department store. \nThe balance was $2,900 when it became delinquent. She is attempting to \nestablish a resolution with the company. She wrote them in January 2008 and \nsent another letter in June 2008. (AE B at 3). On July 1, 2008, Applicant paid \nthat debt in full. (AE D). \n \n3. The $473 debt listed in \u00b6 1.c was paid in January 2008. (AE A at 22). \n \n4. The $832 debt listed in \u00b6 1.d was paid in April 2008. (AE A at 19 and 20). \n \n5. The $8,635 judgment listed in \u00b6 1.f is owed to a credit card company and is \nunpaid. The balance at the time she closed the account was $6,900. (It is a \nduplicate of the debt listed in \u00b6 1.e.) She recently sent a letter to the creditor \nrequesting a repayment plan. (AE B at 4). On June 12, 2008, the company \nresponded to her inquiry and noted that the matter had been resolved and \ndeleted from her credit history. (AE C). \n \n \nSince January 2008, Applicant paid or resolved all of the debts. She submitted a \nbudget, itemizing her income and expense. She and her husband\u2019s combined net \nmonthly income is $3,310.  The monthly expenses are $3,265, leaving about $50 per \nmonth remainder. (AE B at 2).  \n \n  \nApplicant had the above two credit cards for many years and paid them regularly. \nAfter she lost her job in May 2003, she tried to pay some of her debts with her \nunemployment compensation, but was unable to manage her essential expenses and \nmake minimum payments on the credit card accounts. She eventually stopped making \nthose payments. (Tr. 41-43). She has not received any credit counseling, and has not \nconsidered filing bankruptcy. She testified: \n \nUnlike most people, I never even considered filing bankruptcy. These are \nmy debts. They will be paid. I may not be able to do it all now. I may not \nbe able to do it as fast as they would prefer, but they will be paid. They\u2019re \nmy bills, my responsibility. I never had a problem with that. And I never \ntried to run away from any of my bills. They\u2019ve always been there. I\u2019ve \nalways known it. I never hid it, never not talked about it. Am I proud of it \u2013 \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nno. But I hit a situation in my life that I had no control over, that I am now \nrecovering from and I\u2019m doing the best I can. (Tr. 43). \n \n \nApplicant submitted four letters of recommendation, including one from her \npersonal representative. Her former employer of ten years considers her to be a \n\u201cwoman of high moral character and possess [sic] a strong work ethic.\u201d [(AE A at 10). \nHe strongly supports her request for a security clearance. Her former supervisor, from \n1998 to 2001, stated, \u201cShe was a high achiever, confidential, and appreciated by all her \nco-workers.\u201d (AE A at 11). He recommended Applicant to her current employer.  The \ndirector for the school that her son attends also provided a letter on her behalf. He \ncomplimented Applicant\u2019s commitment to her son\u2019s education and role as an exemplary \nparent, recognizing the sacrifices she makes for her child. (AE A at 15).  \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security \nconcerns. Applicant began accumulating a significant amount of delinquent debt that \nshe was unable to pay after she and her husband became unemployed in early spring \nof 2003. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The guideline includes six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated when \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial worries arose in 2003 and continued into 2008 when she began to resolve \nthem. They were the result of unemployment for her and her husband, which is less \nlikely to recur for her, given her employer\u2019s support. The prior situation does not cast \ndoubt on her trustworthiness or good judgment. Because the debt problems are ongoing \nfor almost five years, this condition cannot receive full application.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s debts began \naccumulating after she and her husband lost their employment in spring of 2003. Those \ncircumstances were outside of her control. She presented evidence indicating that she \nattempted to manage some debts by paying her debts with her unemployment \ncompensation. I find this potentially mitigating condition has application in this case.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where \u201cthe \nevidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant did not obtain formal credit counseling; however, \nshe submitted proof that she paid four debts and resolved the other one, indicating that \nshe made a good-faith effort to resolve all of her debts. She submitted a copy of her \nbudget, which demonstrates that her financial obligations are under control. She is \ncarefully managing her limited funds. I conclude these mitigating conditions should be \ngiven consideration. \n \nThe evidence does not support the application of any other mitigating condition. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 38-year-old woman, \nwho began experiencing financial hardships after she and her husband lost their jobs, \nand joint income of about $70,000 in spring of 2003. Prior to this misfortune, she had \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nnot experienced financial difficulties and regularly paid her bills. Since becoming a full-\ntime employee in October 2006, she began resolving her financial difficulties. Since \n2008, she paid four debts and resolved the outstanding judgment. She credibly \nacknowledged those debts as her responsibility and expressed a determination to \nresolve them. \n \n Given her awareness of the effect delinquencies may have on her employment, \nalong with a commitment to responsibly manage her finances, I do not believe similar \nfinancial problems will recur, despite a tight budget. The Appeal Board noted in ISCR \nCase No. 06-12930, \u201cthat an applicant is not required to show that she has completely \npaid off her indebtedness, only that she has established a reasonable plan to resolve \nher debts and has taken \u2018significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-\n09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.6, 2006).\u2019\u201d In this case, Applicant has addressed her \nobligations and has the strong and impressive support from her employer to assist her \nin doing so. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant is an intelligent, \nhardworking individual, who experienced an unanticipated period of unemployment and \nunder-employment that seriously affected her finances. There is no other evidence in \nher background to indicate that her financial problems may create a security risk. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 56-year-old-computer integration specialist for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is married (for 32 years) and has one grown daughter. He has held a security while in the Air force and Air National Guard, and has held a clearance for most of his tenure with his current defense contractor, which commenced in 1978 (R.T., at 83-84, 89-90). Beginning in the early 1990s, Applicant began passing the responsibility for handling family finances to his wife (W). Tired of the discord that accompanied finance 3 disputes between himself and W, he transferred full bill paying responsibility to W in 1997. The arrangement worked satisfactorily for a number of years. Applicant\u2019s arrangement with W to handle all of the family\u2019 finances unraveled following W\u2019s accident in 2002 and resulting back injury. Because of her injury, she was forced to take disability and cease working (R.T., at 52-54). When she could no longer contribute to the family\u2019s financial obligations, she stopped making payments on many of their joint credit card accounts (R.T., at 30). When ever Applicant would ask about the status of their accounts, W would always assure him that she was taking care of them.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 23, 2008 and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 4, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on July 15,\n2008.  A hearing was held on July 15, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it\nwould be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny,\nApplicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and\nthree exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on July 23, 2008.  Based upon a\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of his payments to creditors 1.,e, 1.f and 1.g, an entered\njudgment by the same creditor identified in sub-paragraphs 1.b and 1.c., a written\nbudget, and medical payments.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven\ndays, to July 22, 2008 to supplement the record. The Government was afforded two\ndays to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with\ndocumented copies of payments to creditor 1.d and 1.f, a legal services agreement for\nfiling a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, court records involving creditor 1.c, a statement\nconcerning his recent purchase of a 2008 Ford pick-up truck, and a prepared written\nbudget.  Department counsel did not object to these post-hearing submissions.\nApplicant\u2019s  post-hearing exhibits were admitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated seven debts\nexceeding $101,000.00.  Under Guideline E, he is alleged to have omitted delinquent\ndebts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively, when completing his January\n2007 electronic questionnaire for investigation processing (e-QIP).\n For her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted five of the allegations.  He\ndenied the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.b and 1.c, claiming these entries\nare duplicates of a debt covered by an entered default judgment, which he continues to\noppose.  Applicant claimed, too, that the creditor 1.e debt is a duplicate of the admitted\ndebt covered by creditor 1.g.  Applicant attributed his delinquent debt problems to his\nacquiescing in his wife handling the bills, and her back injuries in 2002 that left her\nunemployable and unable to assist in paying their bills.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 56-year-old-computer integration specialist for a defense contractor\nwho seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is married (for 32 years) and has one grown daughter.  He has held a\nsecurity while in the Air force and Air National Guard, and has held a clearance for most\nof his tenure with his current defense contractor, which commenced in 1978 (R.T., at\n83-84, 89-90).  \nBeginning in the early 1990s, Applicant began passing the responsibility for\nhandling family finances to his wife (W).  Tired of the discord that accompanied finance\n\n3\ndisputes between himself and W, he transferred full bill paying responsibility to W in\n1997.  The arrangement worked satisfactorily for a number of years. \nApplicant\u2019s arrangement with W to handle all of the family\u2019 finances unraveled\nfollowing W\u2019s accident in 2002 and resulting back injury.   Because of her injury, she\nwas forced to take disability and cease working (R.T., at 52-54).  When she could no\nlonger contribute to the family\u2019s financial obligations, she stopped making payments on\nmany of their joint credit card accounts (R.T., at 30).  When ever Applicant would ask\nabout the status of their accounts, W would always assure him that she was taking care\nof them.  W claims she was concerned about Applicant\u2019s health and did not want to\nworry him with their debt delinquencies.  Like W, Applicant has been in poor health for a\nnumber of years.  Both W and Applicant suffer from diabetes and back problems (R.T.,\nat 32-33, 51-54, 68).  Each  underwent bypass surgery (R.T., at 29-30, 51-55).  Their\nco-pays for their medications exceed $1,000.00 a month according to W (R.T., at 35,\n56-57).  While this does seem high, it is not challenged and is accepted.\nBetween 2002 and 2007, Applicant accumulated considerable debt, much of it\nconsumer-related.  Altogether, Applicant and W accrued seven delinquent debts\nexceeding $101,000.00 with accumulated interest and fees.  Applicant claims two of\nthese listed creditors represent duplicate debts.  Whether they are or not cannot be\ndetermined without more documentation.  Applicant provides no evidence of mounted\ndisputes with the credit reporting agencies over the debts he claims are duplicates and\nno correspondence exchanges with the creditors themselves.  While they may be\nduplicates, the duplications cannot be determined from the credit reports.  Without any\ndocumented disputes of these listed debts, too many doubts remain to draw any\nfavorable inferences about their duplicate status.\nOne of the listed accounts (creditor 1.c) is a collection debt that lists an amount\nowed of $33,369.00.  Court records report that this creditor purchased the debt from\nApplicant\u2019s credit card obligee and petitioned the court for recovery of $14,118.02, along\nwith pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, attorneys fees and costs (see ex. G).\nBoth W and records confirm that Applicant and W were served with a summons\nassociated with the petition in May 2006 (compare ex. G with R.T., at 122-28).  Court\ndocuments report that Applicant and W were also mailed a copy of the default judgment\nentered in August 2006 (see ex. G).  Applicant and W do not challenge receipt of the\ndocuments, and made no appearances in the matter (see ex. G; R.T., at 79,124).\nNeither Applicant nor W ever initiated any appeal of the default judgment, and never\nsought to have the judgment vacated for cause.  The judgment itself awards relief to\ncreditor 1.c as follows: $14,118.02 in principal, $14,415.61 in accrued pre-judgment\ninterest, $2,117.70 in attorneys fees, plus costs.  Post-judgment interest by law accrues\non the total balance awarded according to the legal rate of interest.  Without any\npayments towards satisfaction of this judgment, the total judgment balance must\ncurrently exceed $35,000.00.  With post-judgment interest continuing to accrue at the\nlegal rate, this judgment debt can be expected to add significant annual increases to the\noutstanding judgment balance. \n\n4\nWhile Applicant admits to his creditor 1.a debt, he never used the card himself\nand does not know when the account was last addressed.  The creditor 1.a account\nreports an outstanding balance of $12,196.00 on his credit report.  After reviewing his\ncredit report, Applicant asked W to look into it (R.T., at 92).  To date, neither he nor W\nhave received any information from the creditor about the listed debt.  Applicant is\nlooking to his bankruptcy lawyer at this time to help him figure out this debt, and devise\na plan for resolving this debt and others he has no been able to address (R.T., at 92-\n93).  Currently, Applicant\u2019s creditor 1.a debt remains unsatisfied as alleged in the SOR.  \nAddressing his creditor 1.d debt, Applicant assures he has paid this debt down\nconsiderably (to just over $12,000.00) from the amount listed in the SOR ($16,707.00).\nHis written and oral proofs corroborate his claims and are accepted (see ex. B; R.T., at\n48-49, 59-60). While W\u2019s documented payments on this account collectively reflect\nmodest payments, they appear to represent part of an ongoing debt reduction effort\n(compare exs. B and E).  Applicant documents a similar repayment arrangement with\ncreditor 1.f, which is similar enough to the debt covered by her repayment arrangement\nto warrant inferences it is the same identified creditor 1.f debt  (see exs. 3, 4, and D;\nR.T., at 48, 59, 99-100).  \nApplicant assures he had little knowledge of the extent of his debt delinquencies\nbefore his receipt of the SOR.  He acknowledges creditor 1.c\u2019s initiating a debt petition\nagainst him in April 2006, but nothing more about his other delinquent accounts.  In July\n2008 (following the hearing in this case), he and W entered into a legal services\nagreement for the expressed purpose of filing a petition for Chapter 13 relief (see exs C\nand F).  The agreement itself recites schedules and notices to creditors and suggests\nsome knowledge of outstanding debts by both Applicant and W.  The agreement itself\nrecites professional consideration of $3,274.00, which breaks down to a down payment\nof $1,700.00 and monthly payments of $374.00 a month through the plan (see ex. F).  It\nis not clear from their furnished documentation whether or not they have tendered the\nagreed fees and proceeded with the filing of a Chapter 13 petition. \nApplicant and W claim no financial counseling before the hearing and provide no\nevidence of any counseling associated with their Chapter 13 legal agreement (see exs.\nC and F).  Based on the letter they received from their bankruptcy counsel (ex. C),\nApplicant and W are in the process of compiling information necessary for counsel to\nprepare the necessary schedules, and are in the process of preparing to attend a\nrequired counseling session (see ex. C; R.T., at 77-78).  It remains unclear, though,\nwhen Applicant and W will be petitioning for Chapter 13 relief and whether they will be\nable to meet the payment requirements of any approved plan.  Applicant and W provide\nno additional documentation of their Chapter 13 progress, or if and how they are\naddressing their remaining outstanding debts listed in the SOR.  At this time, they\nprovide no documentation of any dispute or repayment efforts relating to creditors 1.b,\n1.e and 1.g, and no favorable inferences can be drawn at this time regarding any of\nthese creditors (R.T., at 47-48, 93-98).\n\n5\nWith their available income, Applicant and W are currently purchasing their\nhome.  Their furnished budget reflects monthly income of around $4,000.00 a month on\naverage for the calendar year of 2008 and estimated payments on current expenses of\naround $4,000.00 a month (see ex. I).  Their budget allocates monthly payments for\ntheir 1.d and 1.f creditors, but nothing more for any of the remaining listed creditors (see\nex. I).  \nApplicant and W value their home at $40,000.00 and owe approximately\n$15,000.00 on the mortgage securing their home loan (R.T., at 107). Applicant\nestimates his mortgage payments are about $630.00 a month.  He has a stock savings\nplan that he contributes to (R.T., at 108).  He also owns a pick-up truck that he\npurchased in March 2008 in exchange for his 2003 trade-in Explorer that he had\nrecently totaled out, and monthly payments of $445.98 (an increase of $11.38 a month\nover the payments he was making on the Explorer) on a $21,729.00 payoff for the new\n2008 vehicle (compare ex. H with R.T., at 110-17).\nAsked to complete a security clearance application (e-QIP) in January 2007,\nApplicant omitted his debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively, when\nresponding to questions 28a and 28b.  He attributed his omissions to his lack of\nknowledge of any delinquent debts besides the judgment debt which he listed (see ex. 1;\nR.T., at 104).   He assures he did not purposely omit his delinquent debts.\nTo be sure, most of Applicant\u2019s omitted debts date to 2002 and (according to W)\nwere admittedly delinquent for long periods of time.  Without a credit report or spouse to\nkeep him abreast of his debts, it is conceivable that he might not have known he had\ndebts at the time that had been or were 180 days delinquent, or were then over 90 days\ndelinquent.  His detailing of the 2002 adverse judgment taken against him by creditor 1.c\nis provides plausible proof of his good-faith intentions about being up-front with his\nknown delinquent debts.  Considering all of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s omissions,\nhis claims of inadvertent omission are accepted as both plausible and credible.\nInferences warrant that Applicant\u2019s omissions were not deliberate, and not made with\nany intent to intentionally mislead the Government.  \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or\ndenied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in\narriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\n\n6\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n7\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nFollowing his wife\u2019s accident and ensuing disability in 2002, Applicant and his wife\nfell behind with their debts.  Out of concern of worrying Applicant, W did not share\ninformation with Applicant for many years regarding the delinquent status of their\naccounts.  Only the petition for relief filed by creditor 1.c in May 2006 was made known\nto Applicant, and only because he was personally served with the petition, and later\nnotified of the default judgment.  Applicant\u2019s listed debts either remain unresolved or\nhave only recently been addressed with modest repayment arrangements.  Absent\ndocumented discharge or payment initiatives with her remaining listed creditors,  these\ndebts raise security significant concerns.  Of initial security concern, too, are Applicant\u2019s\nomissions of his delinquent debts in his completed e-QIP.\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his still outstanding delinquent debts warrant the application\nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations:\nDC \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d These disqualifying conditions cover the core concern of\nAG \u00b6 18: poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, which, both individually and collectively, can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to safely occupy a position of trust.  \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated debts are attributable in part to his wife\u2019s 2002 accident\nand ensuing disability, and her failure to keep him apprised of the status of his debts.\nTogether, his described difficulties in knowing and apprehending the status of his\naccounts, through no obvious fault of his own provide enough extenuating circumstances\nto warrant some application of mitigating conditions covered by AG \u00b6 18.  MC \u00b6 20(b),\n\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances,\u201d has some application.\nAt this time, none of Applicant\u2019s covered debts are documented to have been\npaid, disputed, or settled.  They exceed $101,000.00 in the aggregate and represent a\nconsiderable debt load on his current income sources.  His documented payment\narrangements with creditors 1.d and 1.f represent some progress in addressing these\nparticular debts, but not enough to manifest any established plan for addressing his other\nlisted debts.  While somewhat encouraging, these two payment arrangements are still\nvery recent and modest and reflect too little seasoning to warrant any significant overall\nmitigation weight. \n\n8\nWithout more documented information to demonstrate Applicant is addressing the\nbulk of his listed debts and making use of financial counseling, he cannot safely mitigate\nall of the Government\u2019s financial concerns.  Holding a security clearance involves the\nexercise of important fiducial responsibilities, which include the expectancy of consistent\ntrust and candor.  Financial stability in a person cleared for access to classified\ninformation is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the\nclearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial\ndifficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are\nimplicit in financial cases.\nUse of a whole person assessment that takes into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt repayment efforts, while encouraging, are\nstill insufficient to enable him to surmount security concerns independent of the express\ndisqualifying conditions covered by AG \u00b6 18.  Without more exhibited payment seasoning\nand work-out efforts to demonstrate progress in resolving his remaining debts, it is\ndifficult to draw convincing conclusions about his overall trustworthiness based on\nfactors not covered in the mitigation conditions of the guideline for financial\nconsiderations.  Based on their  current reported income, it does not appear likely that\nApplicant and W will be in a position to make any material reductions in his remaining\ndebts in the foreseeable future.  While his proposed Chapter 13 petition holds some\npromise, its preparation and filing are still too uncertain to facilitate any firm predictions\nabout the likelihood of the petition\u2019s success.   \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance of\na \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d in the management of an applicant\u2019s finances, which\ncertainly includes evidence of actual debt reduction through repayments.  See ISCR\nCase No. 05-01920, at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007).  True, an applicant\u2019s good-faith debt\nrepayment does not require that he demonstrate repayment of each and every listed\ndebt.  All that is required is that the applicant demonstrate that he developed a plan to\nresolve his debts and taken significant actions to implement the plan.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 07-16013, at 2 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 04-09684, at 2 (App. Bd.\nJuly 6, 2006). \nApplicant fails to meet  Appeal Board requirements for repayment progress with\nhis modest repayments to a couple of his listed creditors.  Most of Applicant\u2018s listed\ndebts lack any kind of dispute or repayment documentation.  Particularly troublesome is\nthe outstanding judgment taken against him in August 2006.  With accruing post-\njudgment interest continuing to accrue, the judgment is likely approaching $40,000.00 in\naggregate debt and places Applicant in serious risk of a levy on his personal and real\nproperty interests. Absent some tangible form of repayment plan on this debt and his\nother covered debts, safe predictive judgments about his finances cannot be made at\nthis time.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\nunsatisfied debts and overall presentation of payment histories, Applicant does not\nmitigate security concerns related to her still outstanding debts.  Unfavorable conclusions\n\n9\nwarrant with respect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through1.c, 1.e\nand 1.g.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.d, and 1.f.\nApplicant\u2019s debt omissions\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s omitted delinquent debts\nin the e-QIP he completed in January 2007.  He attributed his omissions to his lack of\nany knowledge of debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent. He cites the adverse judgment\ncovering creditor 1.c that he did list as proof of his good-faith intentions to disclose\nknown creditors.   His claims have merit. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\nand hardworking applicant who deferred to his wife to manage their finances and pay the\nbills.  By W\u2019s credible accounts, she deliberately withheld the status of his debt\ndelinquencies out of concern for his health.  Applicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions were not\nmotivated by any deliberate intent to mislead the Government, and his omissions are not\nindicative of any overall trust problem. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s accepted explanations, he may take full advantage of: MC\n17(f), \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d\nOverall, Applicant is credited with his successful refutation of the allegations of\nfalsification in sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of  the SOR.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT   \nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         FOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a::\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n10\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

This debt has been placed for collection.\nApplicant submitted letters from a number of his supervisors and coworkers.\nThese letters establish that applicant is considered to be an honest, hardworking\nemployee who performs very well at his job.\nIn his responses to the SOR and FORM, applicant made numerous statements\nabout how he intended to make payments on certain debts, and how he had made\npayment arrangements with various creditors. In the end, however, he offered little proof\nof any payments on the debts listed in the SOR.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\n\n3\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant has a long history of an inability\nor unwillingness to pay his debts. Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are\napplicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\n\n4\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s numerous debts are\nstill outstanding. His current inability or unwillingness to address them in any meaningful\nway casts doubt on his current judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Accordingly,\nthis mitigation condition is not applicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by conditions largely beyond his control.\nAccordingly, this mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph c. In his SOR response, applicant claims that\nbecause his defaulted student loans were accepted by the Florida Department of\nEducation for \u201cloan rehabilitation,\u201d this mitigating condition should apply because the\nloan rehabilitation program \u201cis designed to counsel and help individuals whose loans are\nin default and get them in good standing.\u201d This mitigating condition applies only with\nrespect to applicant\u2019s student loan debts.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has\nexpressed his intention to repay his debts. However, to date, he has not initiated any\nmeaningful action to repay them. This mitigating condition does not apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who has\na history of not meeting his financial obligations. Although he has expressed an intent to\nrepay his past-due debts, he has in fact done very little to address them. Based on the\nforegoing, I conclude applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from\nGuideline F.\n\n5\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Previously she worked from December 2005 until her present employment doing the same job, but with a different contractor. On February 16, 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In response to section 24 asking about her use of illegal drugs in the past, she stated she had used marijuana approximately 20 times between September 2001 and November 2004. Applicant knew when she completed the SCA that she used marijuana more than 20 times during this time period and intentionally under reported her drug use. Her explanation for failing to be completely honest was because she was worried that she would not be granted a security clearance if she accurately reported her drug use or that she would lose her job. She thought her drug use would negatively impact her ability to be granted a security clearance. Applicant admitted at her hearing that she was not truthful when answering questions on her SCA regarding her drug use.1 In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she explained her rationale for under reporting her drug use as follows: I deny this statement.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 22, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 12, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 18, 2009. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on March 23, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant and one witness testified. \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant also offered Exhibit (AE) A. Department Counsel did not object and it was \nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 30, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 26 years old and single. She has an associate\u2019s degree and has \nworked as a program specialist for a defense contractor since April 2006. Previously \nshe worked from December 2005 until her present employment doing the same job, but \nwith a different contractor.  \n \nOn February 16, 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application \n(SCA). In response to section 24 asking about her use of illegal drugs in the past, she \nstated she had used marijuana approximately 20 times between September 2001 and \nNovember 2004. Applicant knew when she completed the SCA that she used marijuana \nmore than 20 times during this time period and intentionally under reported her drug \nuse. Her explanation for failing to be completely honest was because she was worried \nthat she would not be granted a security clearance if she accurately reported her drug \nuse or that she would lose her job. She thought her drug use would negatively impact \nher ability to be granted a security clearance. Applicant admitted at her hearing that she \nwas not truthful when answering questions on her SCA regarding her drug use.1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she explained her rationale for under reporting \nher drug use as follows: \n \nI deny this statement. I disclosed the amount of times I used marijuana in \nthe in person interview. During this interview I explained that I was afraid \nthat by telling the truth in the form that I wouldn\u2019t get a clearance, but \nthought that I should be honest 2 years later when I was interviewed.2 \n \nOn February 9, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). During the interview she admitted while at \ncollege from September 2001 to November 2004 she would smoke marijuana most \ndays. It gave her a calming effect and gave her creativity for her art work. During this \ninterview she admitted that she purchased marijuana on two to three occasions. She \nalso admitted she failed a drug test given by an employer in 2004. She was given \nsubsequent drug tests, which she passed. On October 15, 2008, Applicant swore to the \naccuracy of her February 9, 2007, statement.3 \n \n \n1 Tr. 36-37. \n \n2 Answer to SOR. \n \n3 GE 2.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nAt her hearing Applicant testified she intentionally minimized the amount \nof her marijuana use and drug purchases during her February 9, 2007, OPM \ninterview because she was nervous and scared she would not get a security \nclearance.4 \n \n \nOn April 3, 2007, Applicant was again interviewed by an investigator from \nOPM. She stated she was unsure of how many times she used marijuana \nbetween September 2001 and November 2004, but it may have exceeded 100 \ntimes. In her first interview she listed only 20 times because she couldn\u2019t recall \nthe exact amount. She used marijuana between 1-2 times a week until the school \nyear ended in spring 2002. She purchased marijuana approximately ten times \nduring this time period. She transferred schools in the fall of 2002 and continued \nto use marijuana about once or twice a month. After she graduated she \npurchased marijuana approximately three times on the streets of the city where \nshe lived. She continued to smoke marijuana about once a month.5 \n \n \nApplicant stopped smoking marijuana after she failed a random drug test \ngiven by her employer in 2004. She decided her career was more important and \nstopped using illegal drugs. She passed the subsequent random drug tests \nconducted by her employer. She admitted while working as a free lance artist for \nher employer she would smoke marijuana at home about 30 minutes before \nbeginning her work. At her hearing she testified that she was never \u201chigh\u201d at \nwork. Applicant swore to the accuracy of her April 3, 2007 statement on October \n15, 2008.6 \n \n \nAt her hearing Applicant stated that after she consulted with her present \nemployer about her security clearance interview she was told she should have \ndivulged the entire truth. She was also told by her mentor that she should tell the \nwhole truth.7  \n \n \nIn interrogatories subscribed and sworn to on March 22, 2008, Applicant \nanswered question 3, which asked about her prior illegal drug use, that she used \nmarijuana twice a day prior to 2004. Her last use was 2004 and she has no \nintention of using illegal drugs in the future. Her family and her employer are \naware of her past drug use. She no longer associates with those friends with \nwhom she used drugs. She did not have her priorities straight and now she does. \nShe is willing to take random drug tests to show she no longer uses illegal \ndrugs.8 \n \n4 Tr. 36-42. \n \n5 GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. 48-49; GE 2. \n \n7 Tr. 44-46. \n \n8 Tr. 31-33; GE 3. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant admitted at her hearing that she did not reveal the full extent of \nher marijuana use on her SCA. She admitted she was only estimating her use on \nher SCA. She admitted that during her two interviews her memory improved as to \nhow much she used marijuana. She finally admitted during her April 3, 2007, \ninterview that she smoked marijuana most days throughout college. She knew \nhow often she used marijuana during college and when she completed her SCA \nand when she listed she only used it 20 times.9 She testified as follows: \u201cWhen I \nfilled out the application, I was worried that I would not be able to gain a \nclearance knowing that I had smoked marijuana more than 20 times.\u201d She further \nstated: \u201cHowever, when I filled out the application, it wasn\u2019t to lie, you know, to lie \nabout it. I just wasn\u2019t sure exactly what I should put down. I was very young and \nnervous.\u201d10 I find Applicant intentionally and deliberately provided inaccurate \ninformation on her SCA and during her interview. \n \n \nApplicant was questioned as to why, when she was interviewed on \nFebruary 9, 2007, she did not provide the complete details about her marijuana \nuse. She stated: \u201cI was also very nervous at that point. I wasn\u2019t sure what I \u2013I \nmean, I understand now that I should have been very truthful with them. I \nhonestly don\u2019t have an explanation.\u201d She admitted she did not make an effort to \ncorrect her inaccuracies until she was contacted for a second interview. 11 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that when she began the SCA process her prior \nemployer required her to have a security clearance. She admitted she was \nuntruthful on her SCA when she was employed by this contractor. When she \nbegan work for her current employer, she learned she did not need a clearance \nto actually do her job. She testified she then provided truthful information \nbecause her mentor and supervisor explained she needed to be truthful \nregardless of the outcome of the security clearance process. It was at this point \nshe told the truth about her drug past.12  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on her behalf. Applicant has worked for her \nfor approximately three years. Applicant has advanced to work on more \nchallenging assignments. She believes Applicant to be honest, trustworthy, and \ncaring. Her job performance is rated as excellent. She has never known \nApplicant to be dishonest.13  \n \n \n9 Tr. 22-25. \n \n10 Tr. 25-28. \n \n11 Tr. 28-29. \n \n12 Tr. 51-56. Department Counsel verified that Applicant was being sponsored by her employer \nfor a security clearance. \n \n13 Tr. 61-71. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s deputy program manager testified on her behalf. She has \nworked for him for three years. He believes she is an honest and trustworthy \nperson and rates her performance as \u201cstrong.\u201d She is independent and self-\nmotivated.14  \n \n \nA coworker/supervisor also provided a character letter for Applicant. She \nconsiders Applicant is an outstanding employee. She stated \u201c[h]er work ethic is \nbeyond reproach and she has earned the complete trust and confidence of her \npeers and subordinates alike.\u201d She is a trusted member of the team and can be \nrelied upon to be forthright and honest in all matters.15  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.\u201d \n  \n \n14 Tr. 71-85. \n \n15 AE A. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \nI have considered all of the facts and find Applicant deliberately omitted, \nconcealed, misled, and falsified information on her 2006 SCA and during her 2007 \ninterview with an OPM investigator. I find disqualifying conditions (a) and (b) apply.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nApplicant did not make an effort to correct the omissions and falsifications on her \nSCA before being confronted. Applicant continued to minimize her drug history during \nher first interview. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. Her actions can not be \nconsidered minor because she failed to divulge important information that was pertinent \nto her security clearance investigation and determination thereby casting doubt about \nher reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Telling the truth on a SCA, regardless \nof the ramifications, is at the heart of determining whether someone is trustworthy and \nhonest. Applicant willingly lied because she believed it would negatively impact her \nability to obtain a security clearance or keep her job. This is precisely the type of test \nthat reflects whether a person can be trusted to tell the truth and safeguard our nation\u2019s \nsecrets, especially when the consequences may be detrimental to ones personal well-\nbeing. Applicant did not pass that test. She acknowledged she was young, immature, \nand scared of losing her job or not being granted a security clearance. It is troubling that \nnot until she was told by a supervisor and mentor that she should be completely truthful, \ndid she finally do so. Although she has acknowledge her mistakes and now has a better \nunderstanding of the process, not enough time has passed to confirm that Applicant has \npermanently changed her behavior and will consistently adhere to the high standards \nrequired of those holding security clearances, regardless of the consequences. I find \nnone of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young woman with an \nexcellent work record. I have considered the character testimony and statement \nprovided along with her youth and immaturity at the time she was going through the \nsecurity clearance process. I considered Applicant knowingly and intentionally falsified \nher SCA and provided untruthful information during her 2007 OPM interview. Applicant \nshould not have to decide when she needs to tell the truth, but rather to always tell the \ntruth. It is apparent Applicant has learned an important lesson. She deserves credit for \neventually admitting the full extent of her marijuana use. However, under the \ncircumstances of this case, it is too early to confirm that Applicant has a committed \nunderstanding to ensuring she is always truthful despite the potential negative impact it \nmay have on her personally. Honesty and truthfulness is the cornerstone of ensuring \nour nation\u2019s secrets are protected. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts at this time as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant:  Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn November 11, 2006, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application \n(SF 86). On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 27, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was originally assigned to me in April \n2008 and then reassigned to another administrative judge on June 19, 2008. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on June 25, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 15, 2008. \nOn July 14, 2008, the assigned administrative judge had a medical emergency that \nnecessitated the cancellation of the hearing. The hearing was rescheduled to July 18, \n2008, and reassigned to me. I convened the hearing on said date. The Government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through D into evidence that were \nadmitted without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until \nAugust 1, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On \nJuly 28, 2008, he submitted three documents that I marked as AE E through G and \nadmitted into the record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on July 29, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Palestine and Jordan. (Tr. 7-8) The request and the attached \ndocuments are included in the record as Hearing Exhibits Group A (HE A) I through VI \n(Palestine) and Hearing Exhibits Group B (HE B) I through IV (Jordan). Applicant did not \nobject to my consideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations contained in SOR \u00b6 1 and \u00b6 2, and offered explanations in support of his \nrequest for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He was born in Jerusalem and went to high school \nthere. (Tr. 25). In 1979, he came to the United States on a student visa to attend \nundergraduate school. In 1984, he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering \nand physics. The same year, he began a graduate program. In August 1986, he earned \na Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Six months later, he returned to \nPalestine where he stayed until September 1989. He then returned to the United States \nto begin work on a doctorate. In June 1994, he completed a Ph.D. in Mechanical \nEngineering. (Tr. 27). He became a naturalized citizen in July 1996.  \n \n \nWhile in his doctoral program, Applicant married his wife, who was enrolled in the \nCollege of Pharmacy at the university he was attending.  She was born in Jordan and \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 1992. She holds dual citizenship with Jordan \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nand the United States. (Tr. 56). They have three young children, all born in the United \nStates.  \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Palestine. His mother died in 2005. His father is \na dual citizen of the United States and Palestine. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen \nabout three years ago, having periodically spent a number of years in the United States, \nalong with Applicant\u2019s mother. (Tr. 57). He resides in Palestine where he works as a \ntailor. Applicant tries to call him weekly. The last time he saw his father was in October \n2007, when he visited Applicant in the United States. (Tr. 65). He previously saw him in \n2006 when the family met for a reunion in Jordan and Palestine. (Tr. 60). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s four sisters were born in Palestine. All of them are married and three \nof them are citizens and residents of Palestine, along with their families. One sister\u2019s \nhusband owns a hardware store in Palestine. She does not work. Applicant speaks to \nher every couple months. (Tr. 61). Another sister works for the Irish government, which \nhas an office in Palestine. Her husband works for a Jordanian bank with a branch office \nin Palestine. Applicant speaks to her every couple months. Applicant\u2019s third sister is a \nhomemaker and her husband works as a jeweler in Palestine. Applicant has not spoken \nto her for a few months. (Tr. 64). His fourth sister moved to Canada with her husband \nseveral years ago. She is a housewife and her husband is a hotel manager. Applicant \nspeaks to her weekly and spent last Christmas with them in Canada. (Tr. 62-63).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws were born in Jordan. His father-in-law died in Jordan in March \n2007.  His mother-in-law is a resident of Jordan. Both in-laws worked as pharmacists \nand obtained dual citizenship with Jordan and the United States. (Tr. 65; GE 1 at 24-\n25).  His mother-in-law visits Applicant in the United States every summer and spends a \nmonth or longer. (Tr. 51; 66). His wife attended her father\u2019s funeral. \n \n \nNeither Applicant nor members of his family have been harassed or threatened \nby any government while living in Palestine. (Tr. 84).  He has never been questioned by \nany governmental authority regarding his work while traveling in Jordan or Palestine. \n(Tr. 85).  \n \n \n \n \n \nIn September 1994, Applicant began working for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor. He is an engineering section manager. He has held a Secret security \nclearance since 1996. He has not worked with classified information to date, but may \nneed access to it in the future. (Tr. 31). According to performance evaluations, covering \nperiods between 1994 and 2007, Applicant has consistently received \u201cExceeds\u201d or \n\u201cSignificantly Exceeds\u201d in many rating areas. (AE G). Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent \nsupervisor \nhas known him for over ten years. He notes that Applicant \u201ctakes his job seriously and \nsupports the company\u2019s policies on security.\u201d (AE E). His former supervisor stated that \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cperformance of day to day work activities, strategic thinking, and leadership \nskills are superior. He is highly dependable, conscientious and a goal seeker.\u201d (AE F). \n \n \nApplicant owns two homes in the United States and has U. S. bank accounts. \n(Tr. 75). He does not own property in any foreign country. (Tr. 74). When his father dies, \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nhe and his four sisters may inherit some property in Jordan valued at $100,000. (Tr. 39). \nHe recently executed a Power of Attorney to one of his sisters residing in Palestine to \nact on his behalf as to any matter that may arise regarding a potential inheritance. \n(Answer; AE C). There is no derogatory information in the record concerning his police \nor financial records. He has never been fired from a job. He has never been arrested. \nHe has never used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related incident. (GE 1).  \n \n \nApplicant obtained a U.S. passport sometime in 1996. It was renewed in \nSeptember 2006. (GE 1). At the time he completed his first security clearance \napplication, he had a temporary Jordanian passport. (AE D).  In January 2005 he \nobtained a Palestinian passport that expired in January 2008. (GE 2).  Because he was \nborn in Palestine, he has a Palestinian identification card that is on file with the \nPalestinian and Israeli governments. (Tr. 69). \n \n \nIn December 1997, July 2000, January 2005, and April 2006, Applicant returned \nto Palestine for family visits, including his mother\u2019s funeral in 2005. He used his U.S. \npassport to enter Jordan. He used his Palestinian passport and identification card to \nenter and exit Palestine via Jordan, because Israeli authorities will not permit him to \nenter through Israel because of his Palestinian heritage. (Tr. 68). He could have used \nhis U.S. passport to enter Palestine, but did not because of the delay and \ninconvenience it would cause him, as the Palestinian Authority may spend time \nquestioning him and looking up his identification number. (Tr. 72). He does not intend to \nrenew his Palestinian passport and will use his U.S. passport when he returns to \nPalestine for future family visits. (Tr. 73).  \n \n \n \nUntil the SOR issued, Applicant did not know that possession of a foreign \npassport could create a security clearance problem. He understood that the United \nStates permits one to maintain dual citizenship. (Answer). Prior to traveling to the \nMiddle East, he generally notified his facility security officer (FSO) or his supervisor of \nhis travel plans. (Tr. 82). He does not recall ever being advised by the FSO that \ntraveling on a foreign passport could create a security concern. (Tr. 82-83).  He \nrenounces his Palestinian citizenship. (Tr. 91). Applicant strongly identifies with the \nUnited States, the country he chose to live in 30 years ago. (Tr. 78).  \n \n \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant breached any security policies \nor procedures while holding a security clearance.  \n \nJordan \n \nJordan is a small, Middle Eastern country governed by a constitutional monarchy.   \nIt has a developing economy. Jordan has a pro-Western foreign policy, and has had \nclose relations with the United States for more than forty years. Torture, arbitrary arrest, \nprolonged detention, denial of due process, and restrictions on freedom of speech are \nJordanian human rights problems. Despite aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Jordan remains high. Jordan cooperates with the \nUnited States in fighting international terrorism. Terrorists in Jordan target U.S. interests \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nto exploit and undermine U.S. national security interests. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.     \n \n \n \nPalestine \n \nThe Palestinian Authority is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian \npeople who live in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of the former British League \nof Nations and United Nations\u2019 mandate area known as Palestine at the eastern end of \nthe Mediterranean Sea. This area abuts Israel.  The population of these two areas is \nabout 3.8 million people.  \n \nThere are two main political parties within the Palestinian territory, Fatah and \nHamas. Fatah is a secular political party and the largest party of the two. It supports a \nnegotiated two-state solution with Israel. After the June 2007 fighting between Fatah \nand Hamas, Fatah controls only the West Bank area of Palestine.  Hamas opposes the \ntwo-state solution. It combines Palestinian nationalism with Islamic fundamentalism, and \nwages a periodic terrorist campaign to undermine the Palestinian peace process. \nHamas is designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) by the U.S. Government. \nHamas fires missiles into Israel from the Gaza Strip on occasion as part of their effort.  \nHamas controls the Gaza Strip after the June 2007 fighting with Fatah.  \n \nOther terrorist groups operate in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, such as the \nal\u2013Aksa Martyrs Brigade, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the \nLiberation of Palestine. These three organizations, along with another three, have also \nbeen designated FTOs by the U.S. Government. As a result of the presence of these \ngroups, the threat of terrorism continues to be significant in Palestine and the \nsurrounding areas. In a April 2008 Department of State Travel Warning, the U.S. \ngovernment reminds travelers to be careful in their travels to the West Bank and Gaza \nStrip because of the continuing threat of terrorist attacks and violence. It \u201curges U.S. \ncitizens to defer travel to the West Bank and to avoid all travel to the Gaza Strip.\u201d  \nKidnappings of foreigners, including American citizens, have occurred in both areas of \nPalestine, perpetrated by the various terrorist groups. (HE B III).  \n \nThe Travel Warning cautions U.S. citizens of Palestinian origin that when \nattempting to enter the country, they may face \u201ctime consuming, questioning by \nimmigration and border authorities.\u201d (HE B III).   \n \nThe relationship between the United States and certain Palestinian groups \nremains complicated and adversarial. Terrorists target U.S. citizens for kidnapping and \nways to exploit and undermine U.S. national security interests. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.     \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two of them: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nThe evidence established both disqualifications. Applicant renewed his \nPalestinian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. He used it to enter Palestine \non four separate trips, from December 1997 to April 2006 for purposes of \nconvenience.  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those conditions, the \nburden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the resulting \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 11 provides eleven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two of them are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nApplicant renounced his Palestinian citizenship and his passport expired \nin January 2008, invalidating it. He does not intend to renew it.  Both mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship with his father, who is a \nresident and citizen of Palestine. He has less frequent contacts with three sisters, who \nare residents and citizens of Palestine. He has a close relationship with his mother-in-\nlaw, who is a citizen and resident of Jordan, and visits him every summer. Applicant \nshares living quarters with his wife, who is a dual citizen of Jordan, who returns to \nJordan periodically. Applicant\u2019s connections to his family in Palestine and Jordan could \n\n \n \n \n \n9\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between his security obligations and his desire to \nhelp them, in a situation where they were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with \nharm if he did not cooperate. None of them have any government connection or other \nposition in which they could otherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information or \ntechnology. However, under disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 8(a) and AG \u00b6 8(c), security \nconcerns in this case could arise in connection with the potential that hostile forces and \nterrorists might seek protected information from Applicant by threatening harm to his \nfamily members in the Middle East. All three of the above disqualifications are raised.  \n \nApplicant may inherit property from his father upon his death. The property is \nvalued at $100,000, and would be divided among five siblings, leaving him about \n$20,000.  He has given his sister in Palestine legal authority to manage any interest that \nhe has or may have in the future. Because his interest in the property is speculative at \nthis time, and minimal in amount, the record does not raise AG \u00b6 7(f) that applies when \nthere is evidence that an applicant owns property in a foreign country and the \u201cvalue or \nroutine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they \nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d   \n   \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant maintains a close relationship with his father, through telephone calls \nand periodic visits to Palestine, and the father\u2019s visits to the United States. Although his \nrelationships with his sisters are not as significant as that with his father, he has \nconsistently communicated with them over the years and sees them when he returns to \nJordan and Palestine for family reunions. His mother-in-law visits him in the United \nStates every summer. The positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in \nJordan and Palestine do not involve the government or military, and they would have no \n\n \n \n \n \n10\ninterest in acquiring protected information. However, his father\u2019s and sisters\u2019 physical \npresence in Palestine, an area wracked with terrorism and violence, and a multitude of \ncompeting terrorist groups, some of which are FTOs, create a security concern.  His \npersonal visits to Palestine also raise a security concern. Both of these situations create \na heightened potential that his family could be threatened to the point that Applicant \nwould confront a choice between their interest and those of the United States. He \nmaintains a close relationship with his mother-in-law, who resides in Jordan and spends \nsummers with him. Because of the presence of terrorists in Jordan, this relationship also \ncreates a security concern. It is unlikely that his wife would be threatened by terrorists, \nas she is a naturalized U.S. citizen, permanently residing with him in the United States \nand returning to Jordan very sporadically. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) and AG \u00b6 8(c) do not apply \nto SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2 .b, and 2.d, but do apply to AG \u00b6. 2.c.  \n \nApplicant established application of AG \u00b6 8(b). He has lived in the United States \nfor over 28 years. Since leaving Palestine in 1979, he returned to Palestine for two \nyears, after completing his undergraduate and graduate degrees. He then returned to \nthe United States to pursue a doctoral degree which he finished in 1994. Three months \nafter receiving it, he started a successful career with his current employer. His wife and \nyoung children are U.S. citizens, residing in the United States. He owns property and \nholds bank accounts in the United States. He made a conscious decision to live in the \nUnited States while a young man. There is no evidence that he has connections or \ncontact with any people other than his family members in Jordan or in Palestine. \nAlthough this mitigating condition is applicable, it is insufficient to overcome the security \nconcerns as discussed in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his [or \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for twenty-eight years and has been \na naturalized citizen for twelve years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore \nallegiance to the United States. His spouse is also a naturalized citizen, and his children \nare U.S. citizens by birth. His ties to these family members are stronger than his ties to \nfamily members in Palestine and Jordan. His closest family members are his wife and \nchildren. Because they reside with him, they are not vulnerable to coercion or \nexploitation by a foreign power. The realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, \nexploitation or duress with regard to his wife and young children are low. He owns his \nhome in the United States, and his financial interests in the United States are solid, \nwhereas, any interest in his parent\u2019s estate in Palestine is speculative. His Palestinian \npassport has expired. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could \ncause potential harm to the United States. He testified credibly that he takes his loyalty \nto the United States very seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense \ncontractor since 1994. His supervisors assess him as loyal and trustworthy. \n \nSix circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First, \nPalestine is an area with a long history of terrorism and hostile to the United States \nbecause of its relationship to Israel. More importantly for security purposes, Palestinian \nterrorist groups routinely engage in violent activities directed at the United States and its \nallies. Palestinian terrorist groups kidnap people, including U.S. citizens, and actively \nseek information they think will be useful to them in attaining their terrorist goals. They \nmay attempt to use his father and siblings in Palestine to obtain such information. \nSecond, he had significant connections to Palestine before he immigrated to the United \nStates in 1979. He was born there and attended high school there. Third, his three \nsisters and families are Palestinian citizens and residents. Fourth, he has frequent and \nnon-casual contact with his father and some communication with his three sisters. Since \n1996, he has visited Palestine, via Jordan, four times: 1997, 2000, 2005 and 2006. He \nintends to return for family visits in the future, despite his awareness of the potential \nsecurity risks it poses for him when entering the country. Fifth, he obtained a Palestinian \npassport after he became a U.S. citizen in 1996. He maintained it until it expired in \nJanuary 2008. He used it to enter and exit Palestine from Jordan in 1997, 2000, 2005 \nand 2006, in order to bypass the inconvenient questioning and delays at the border for \ntravelers using passports issued by countries other than Palestine. Sixth, his wife \nmaintains dual citizenship with Jordan, where her mother resides. She returns there \nperiodically.  \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \n\n \n \n \n \n12\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he mitigated the security \nconcerns pertaining to foreign preference, but not to foreign influence. Nothing in this \ncase suggested Applicant was not a loyal American citizen and a credit to his adopted \ncountry. His allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings, but \nrather the presence of his family in an area known for violence and terrorism and the \nheightened security risk it creates.1 This is a close case, but ultimately the evidence \nleaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                             \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                            \n1 See  ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 13, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 17, 2008. Applicant did not file a\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June 24, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\nSOR Response, page 2.\n1\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 39 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nApplicant was born and raised in the United States. In 1994, she married a\ncitizen of the Netherlands. She applied for, and in October 2005 received, Netherlands\ncitizenship. In her SOR response, she explained why she applied for Netherlands\ncitizenship:\n[T]his was applied for and granted merely as a practical, administrative\nsolution to Dutch immigration and naturalization laws. It is to prevent me\nfrom being forced having to enter the costly and extensive immigration\nprocess in the Netherlands, every time upon the return of me and my\nfamily to the Netherlands. Since my husband is employed by [the\nNetherlands government], and as such is sometimes stationed in different\ncountries, this holds especially true.\nApplicant\u2019s three children are dual citizens of the Netherlands and the United\nStates. Two of the children were born in the United States and obtained their citizenship\nfrom the Netherlands based on applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s rights as a citizen of the\nNetherlands.\nApplicant obtained a passport from the Netherlands in 2005. She has used this\npassport, instead of her United States passport, to travel from the Netherlands to a third\ncountry and on a trip to the Netherlands from the United States.\nIn her SOR response, applicant stated she will not renounce her Netherlands\ncitizenship \u201csolely for the purpose of receiving security clearance.\u201d She will, however,\nrenounce it if her United States citizenship \u201ccomes in danger.\u201d She further stated her\n\u201cloyalties lie with United States.\u201d\nApplicant and/or her husband file tax returns with the Netherlands. Applicant has\nsignificant assets in the Netherlands, and also has \u201cbuilt a pension in the Netherlands\ndue to a mandatory contribution to a pension fund while working.\u201d1\nA number of applicant\u2019s friends are citizens and employees of the Netherlands\ngovernment.\n \nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\n\n3\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Influence guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 6 of the AG, and is as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion\nby any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nParagraph 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.a., \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\n\n4\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.b.,\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information\u201d may be disqualifying. Under Paragraph 7.e., \u201ca substantial\nbusiness, financial, or property interest in a foreign country . . . which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d may be disqualifying.\nLastly, under Paragraph 7.i., \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which\nmay make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country\u201d may be disqualifying.\nApplicant\u2019s marriage to a citizen and employee of the Netherlands raises obvious\nconcerns under Paragraphs 7.a. and 7.b. Applicant\u2019s large financial interests in the\nNetherlands raises concerns under Paragraph 7.e. And, the time applicant spends in\nthe Netherlands leaves her vulnerable to exploitation, pressure and coercion, which\nraises concerns under Paragraph 7.i.\nParagraph 8 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Under\nParagraph 8.a., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can demonstrate that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d Under Paragraph 8.b., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual*s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\u201d Lastly, under Paragraph 8.c., it is potentially mitigating if an applicant can\ndemonstrate that the \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d\nNone of the foregoing mitigating conditions is applicable. Applicant*s relationship\nwith her husband, standing alone, creates a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nApplicant provided insufficient credible evidence that it is unlikely she would be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of the Netherlands and the\ninterests of the United States, or that she is not vulnerable to a conflict of interest.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the Foreign Preference guideline is set forth in\nParagraph 9 of the AG, and is as follows:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\n\n5\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of\nthe United States.\nParagraph 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 10 a.1., exercising any right or privilege of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member, such as possession of a current foreign passport, may be disqualifying.\nApplicant possessed and used a Netherlands passport after becoming a United States\ncitizen. Accordingly, this disqualifying condition applies. Under Paragraph 10.b., \u201caction\nto acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen\u201d may be\ndisqualifying. This disqualifying condition obviously applies. \nParagraph 11 describes potentially mitigating conditions. I have considered them\nand conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature woman who\nvoluntarily applied for and received Netherlands citizenship and a Netherlands passport\nafter marrying a citizen of the Netherlands. Since then she has used the Netherlands\npassport instead of her United States passport to travel overseas on at least two\noccasions. Although two of her three children were born in the United States, she and\nher husband obtained Netherlands citizenship for them. Because of her husband\u2019s\nemployment with the Netherlands government, applicant and her family have lived in\nthe Netherlands, and there is no reason to believe she will not move back to the\nNetherlands, perhaps permanently. She has significant assets in the Netherlands,\nincluding pension rights. Applicant\u2019s marriage to a foreign citizen and her other\nsignificant ties to the Netherlands creates a heightened risk of pressure, coercion,\nexploitation and duress.\nAlthough I have considered the fact the Netherlands and the United States are\nclose allies, this fact is not determinative. It is a known fact that friendly nations and\nallies have engaged in espionage against the United States.\n\n6\nI have carefully reviewed the administrative record, applicant*s submissions, and\nthe allegations in the SOR. I have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines B and C, and I have evaluated applicant*s conduct in light of the whole\nperson concept identified at Paragraph E2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive. After doing\nso, I conclude that applicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s case under Guidelines B\nand C.\nThere is nothing in the record that suggests applicant is anything but a loyal\nAmerican citizen. Applicant*s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these\nproceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that industrial\nsecurity clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Therefore,\nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in\nwhole or in part, on any express or implied concern as to applicant*s allegiance, loyalty,\nor patriotism.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nGuideline B: AGAINST APPLICANT\nGuideline C: AGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 30, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nNovember 20, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that it was unfair of the Judge to deny him a clearance just because he was\noriginally from Sudan and had family members living in that country.  Applicant\u2019s argument does\nnot demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether an applicant personally believes the Judge was\nunfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead\na reasonable person to question her fairness or impartiality.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at\n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made\nadverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 19, 2007).  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of\nsuch error, standing alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Applicant has not met this heavy burden of\npersuasion, in that he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis\nfor a reasonable person to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven circumstances\nunder any of its Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-\n22643 at 7 (App. Bd. Jun. 24, 2005).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 03-18218 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2005).  DOHA has adjudicated foreign preference\ncases involving applicants associated with or having family ties to a wide variety of countries.\nForeign ties such as the ones maintained by Applicant are of legitimate concern to the Department\n\n3\nin assessing risks to the nation\u2019s security.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-04713 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar.\n27, 2003).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant as to Guidelines C and E.  However, she\nreasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After reviewing\nthe record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a\nsatisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent\nwith the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988).  Therefore, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline B\nis sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn July 5, 2006, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On April 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, Guideline B, Foreign Influence, and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nNovember 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \n \nOn May 24, 2008, June 14, 2008, and July 3, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR \nin writing and elected to have a decision without a hearing. With his answer, he \nprovided additional explanatory material, including several photocopied pages from his \nU.S. and Sudanese passports.  By memorandum dated July 10, 2008, Department \nCounsel requested a hearing under \u00b6 E3.1.7 of Enclosure 3, Additional Procedural \nGuidance, of the Directive. On August 21, 2008, the case was assigned to me. I \nconvened a hearing on October 1, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The \nGovernment called no witnesses, introduced four exhibits (Ex. 1 through 4), and offered \nfacts in twelve official documents of the U.S. Government for administrative notice. (HE \nI.) The Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. Applicant did not \nintroduce exhibits. He testified on his own behalf and called no other witnesses. Sua \nsponte, I corrected a typographical error in the delineation of the allegations under SOR \n\u00b6 2.  The corrected delineation of allegations under SOR \u00b6 2 reads: 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d), \nand 2(e). I also, on my own motion, revised SOR \u00b6 2.(c) to read: \u201cYour six brothers are \nresidents and citizens of Sudan.\u201d I made this change pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of Enclosure \n3 to render the allegation in conformity with the evidence adduced at the hearing.1 \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 10, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations that raise security concerns under AG C, \nForeign Preference (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.), five allegations that raise security \nconcerns under AG B, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.e.), and one allegation \nthat raised a security concern under AG E, Personal Conduct. In his Answer dated May \n23, 2008, Applicant denied all allegations under Guidelines C, B, and E. In his answers \ndated June 14, 2008 and July 3, 2008, Applicant admitted the five allegations under AG \nB, Foreign Influence. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old.  He was born and raised in Sudan.  He began to study \nEnglish when he was 15 years old. He learned to speak English from Sudanese \nspeakers of English. During the hearing, I sometimes found it difficult to understand \nwhat Applicant was saying. He is employed as a security officer by a government \ncontractor and seeks a security clearance (Ex. 1; Tr. 32-34, 37.)  \n \n \nApplicant is the youngest of eight children. He has six living brothers and one \nsister, who is deceased. He is the only member of his family to immigrate to the United \nStates. His mother and his six brothers are citizens and residents of Sudan. None of \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s e-QIP lists no sisters and seven brothers, one of whom is deceased. The deceased sibling \nlisted on the e-QIP appears to have a feminine first name. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he has \nsix living brothers and that his only sister is deceased. (Ex. 1, 28-32; Tr. 70-71.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s brothers works for the government of Sudan.  They all earn their livings as \nsmall businessmen and commercial traders.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; Tr. 52, 61-62, \n71-72.) \n \n \nFrom 1981 to 1986, Applicant attended a university in a Middle Eastern country \nand received a bachelor\u2019s degree in agriculture. In 1996 and 1997, he pursued a \nmaster\u2019s degree in industrial science at a university in Sudan. He discontinued his \nstudies when he was selected in a lottery to immigrate to the United States.  (Tr. 34-35.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant immigrated to the United States in 1998, he possessed a \nSudanese passport issued in February 1998.  Applicant\u2019s Sudanese passport expired in \n2000. He did not renew his Sudanese passport after it expired. From January 2001 \nthrough May 2005, he studied for a master\u2019s degree in computer science at a U.S. \nuniversity.  He became a U.S. citizen in August 2004. (Documents attached to \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; Ex. 1; Tr. 36, 38, 44.) \n \n \nApplicant was married for the first time in Sudan in February 1996.  He divorced \nhis wife in 2001.  In 2004, he acquired a U.S. passport and obtained a Sudanese travel \nvisa. He traveled first to Saudi Arabia for religious observances. He then used his U.S. \npassport to enter and exit Sudan.  In December 2004, while in Sudan, Applicant married \nfor the second time. His second wife is the daughter of Applicant\u2019s uncle. His wife \nremained behind when he returned to the United States. (Ex. 1; Tr. 38-41, 57.) \n \n \nIn August 2005, Applicant acquired a Sudanese travel visa and traveled again to \nSudan to visit his wife and other family members. He used his U.S. passport to enter \nand exit Sudan.  He did not remember if he also carried his expired Sudanese passport \nwith him on this trip.2 Applicant and his wife also traveled to Egypt. In October 2005, \nApplicant returned to the United States and his wife remained in Sudan. In July 2006, \nApplicant\u2019s wife received permission from the U.S. immigration service to enter the \nUnited States. She resides with Applicant in the United States and is a citizen of Sudan. \nShe holds resident alien status. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens \nand residents of Sudan. (Tr. 38-40, 52-53.) \n \n \nOn October 1, 2008, the day of Applicant\u2019s hearing, his wife was in Sudan visiting \nher family. In December 2008, Applicant plans to travel to Saudi Arabia for religious \nobservances.  He then intends to travel to Sudan to visit his family members.  (Tr.  42-\n43, 53.) \n \n \nApplicant provides some support to his mother and brothers in Sudan, but not on \na regular basis. If they tell him they need money, he tries to send them whatever he \ncan. Applicant also stays in touch with his mother and communicates with her by \ntelephone. He estimated that he called her once or twice a month.  Applicant\u2019s mother \nlives with one of his brothers, and so when Applicant calls his mother, he also speaks \n \n2 In response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant stated that he had surrendered his expired \nSudanese passport to his employer\u2019s security officer on February 14, 2008.  (Ex. 3 at 4; Tr. 44-45.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwith that brother.  His telephone contacts with his other brothers are not as frequent as \nthose with the brother with whom his mother lives. Even so, Applicant considers his   \nrelationships with his brothers to be close. Applicant also has telephone contact with his \nwife\u2019s parents. When his wife calls her parents, Applicant also speaks with them.  (Tr. \n53-61.)  \n \n \nWhen he was interviewed by an authorized investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management, Applicant told the interviewer that he had maintained dual \ncitizenship with Sudan because dual citizen status made it easier for him to travel to \nSudan to visit his relatives. He also said he would relinquish his Sudanese citizenship if \nthat were necessary. At his hearing, Applicant stated he believed himself to be an \nAmerican. He noted, however, that he had come to the United States at the age of 37, \nafter living in Sudan all of his life. Thus he could not deny he was Sudanese, \u201cbecause \nmy family is there.\u201d He also stated in his Answer to the SOR that he felt a loyalty to the \nUnited States because his future and his family\u2019s future were in the United States.  (Ex. \n2, at 4; Tr. 64; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nApplicant completed and signed his e-QIP on July 5, 2006.  Question 17(d) on \nthe e-QIP reads as follows: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that \nwas issued by a foreign government?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201dno\u201d to Question 17(d).  (Ex. \n1 at 33.) \n \n \nApplicant denied he had deliberately failed to disclose he had an active passport \nin the last seven years. He said he had answered the e-QIP on his own and without \nconsulting anyone else.  He stated he thought the relevant date for marking the seven \nyear time frame was February 1998, when his Sudanese passport was issued and not \nFebruary 2000, when the Sudanese passport expired. Thus, when he answered \nQuestion 17(d), on or about July 5, 2006, he concluded that more than seven years had \npassed since the passport had been issued.  (Tr. 65-68.)  \n \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts offered by the Government and \nderived from official U.S. publications: \n \nIn February 1953, the United Kingdom and Egypt concluded an \nagreement that provided for Sudanese self-government, with a transitional \nperiod toward independence.  Sudan achieved independence on January \n1, 1956, under a provisional constitution.  A mutiny of army officers led to \nseventeen years of civil war (1955-1972). A peace agreement was \nreached in 1972, but civil war began again in January 1983 when soldiers \nmutinied.  Through the 1990s, there were a series of regional efforts to \nbring the Sudanese civil war to an end.  By mid-2001, prospects for peace \nin Sudan appeared to be remote.  On January 9, 2005, a Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement was signed, establishing a new Government of National \nUnity and the interim Government of Southern Sudan, and stipulating a \nsix-year interim period to allow for implementation of the Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement and elections at all levels.  Although some progress \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwas achieved, meaningful implementation of key provisions of the \nComprehensive Peace Agreement has faltered.  (HE 1: U.S. Department \nof State, Background Note: Sudan, dated July 2008, at 3-5.) \n \nA rebellion in Darfur has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of \npersons in Darfur, and has led to an estimated two million internally \ndisplaced persons in Sudan and close to 250,000 refugees in neighboring \nChad. The Sudanese Government \u2018is complicit in the bombing, murder, \nand rape of innocent civilians\u2019 in Darfur, and the Sudanese President has \ndemonstrated a \u2018continued refusal to honor his commitments to end the \nviolence in Darfur.\u2019  The United States government continues to be \u2018deeply \nconcerned about the violence in Darfur, which includes unconscionable \nattacks \nagainst \ninnocent \ncivilians, \nhumanitarian \nworkers, \nand \npeacekeepers.\u2019  (HE 1: U.S. Department of State, The U.S. Response to \nthe Darfur Crisis, dated October 1, 2007, at 1; U.S. Department of State: \nThe U.S. Response to the Situation in Darfur, dated April 23, 2008, at 1. \n \nIn August 1993, Sudan was designated by the Secretary of State as a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. Although Sudan has \u2018pursu[ed] terrorist \noperations directly involving threats to U.S. interests and personnel in \nSudan, the terrorist threat level has \u2018remained high in Khartoum and \nDarfur,\u2019 and Sudan remains on the State Department list of State \nSponsors of Terrorism. (HE 1: U.S. Department of State, State Sponsors \nof Terrorism; U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Terrorism, \nChapter 3 \u2013 State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, dated April 30, 2008, \nat 2.) \n \nSudan is under a broad U.S. embargo, with extensive trade restrictions on \nexports and reexports to Sudan.  In 1997, President Clinton issued \nExecutive Order 13067, which declared that the policies and actions of the \nGovernment of Sudan \u2018constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security and foreign policy of the United States.\u2019 In 2006, \nPresident Bush issued Executive Order 13412, which cited \u2018the \ncontinuation of the threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States created by certain policies and actions of the Government of \nSudan,\u2019 and reaffirmed and supplemented Executive Order 13067.

Terrorist actions may include \nsuicide operations, bombings, or kidnappings.\u2019  Two U.S. Embassy \nemployees were killed by unknown assailants on January 1, 2008, and the \nU.S. State Department has indicated that \u2018[t]errorists are known to operate \nin Sudan, and continue to seek opportunities to carry out attacks against \nU.S. interests,\u2019 and \u2018[a]nti-American sentiment is prevalent and Americans \nshould exercise caution at all times.\u2019 (HE 1: U.S. Department of State, \nTravel Warning, Sudan, dated March 14, 2008, at 1; U.S. Department of \nState, Country Specific Information, Sudan, dated March 12, 2008, at 2.) \n \n   \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States.\u201d  Such an individual \u201cmay be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  These disqualifying conditions are as follows: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(3) accepting \neducational, \nmedical, \nretirement, \nsocial \nwelfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship \nrequirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and  \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Sudan by \nmaintaining a Sudanese passport after becoming a United States citizen on August 13, \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and exercising dual citizenship with Sudan by using his Sudanese \npassport instead of his U.S. passport to travel to Sudan (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). The SOR also \nalleged, ungrammatically and inartfully, that \u201cyou ultimate loyalty is to Sudan because it \nis the country of his birth.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.c.)  \n \nApplicant provided documentation to show that he possessed an active \nSudanese passport from February 1998 to February 2000. He provided documentation \nto show that he had not renewed the Sudanese passport when it expired in February \n2000 and that he used his U.S. passport when he traveled to Sudan in 2004 and 2005. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant rebutted SOR allegations 1.a. and 1.b. \n \nApplicant has deep affection for and loyalty to his family members in Sudan. For \nhim, family is paramount. In his testimony and demeanor, he credibly distinguished \nbetween his loyalty to his family in Sudan and the allegation that he valued his \nSudanese citizenship above his adopted U.S. citizenship. I conclude that the \nGovernment failed to establish by substantial evidence that Applicant demonstrated a \npreference for the government of Sudan over the government of the United States.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The following facts raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d):3  \n \n \nThe Government of Sudan allows violence, murder, rape, and mayhem to \ncontinue unabated in Darfur. Sudan is also a state sponsor of terrorism. Terrorists \noperating in Sudan continue to seek opportunities to carry out attacks against U.S. \ninterests. The U.S. Department of State has warned U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to \nSudan. In this environment hostile to U.S. interests, American citizens with immediate \nfamily members who are citizens or residents of Sudan could be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, six brothers, mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Sudan. He traveled to Sudan to visit his Sudanese relatives in 2004 and \n2005. His wife was in Sudan visiting her family in October 2008.  Applicant plans to \ntravel to Sudan to visit family in December 2008. \n \nApplicant shares his home with his wife, who is a citizen of Sudan. He feels a \nspecial loyalty and obligation to his family members in Sudan. He communicates \nfrequently by telephone with his mother and at least one of his brothers. He also \ncommunicates less frequently by telephone with his wife\u2019s parents and his other five \nbrothers. When he can afford to, he sends his family members money when they ask \nhim.  While none of Applicant\u2019s relatives are employed by the government of Sudan, \nthey live in an environment that is chaotic, violent, and opposed to U.S. security \ninterests.  Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests raise security concerns under the \nforeign influence adjudicative guideline. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \n \n3 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(d) reads: \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d \n\n \n10 \n \n \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his Sudanese family members are not casual or \ninfrequent.  To the contrary, they are strong and charged with emotion. He feels a filial \nobligation to his mother, and he tries to respond to his brothers\u2019 needs and concerns. \nWhen he can, he provides them with monetary support. His relationships with his family \nmembers who are Sudanese citizens and residents are based on long-standing family \nties of affection and obligation.  Applicant is a dutiful husband, son, brother, and son-in-\nlaw who looks after the welfare of his many family members in Sudan, a country that \nposes special dangers to U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 citizenship and residency \nin Sudan create a heightened risk that he could be targeted for exploitation, pressure, or \ncoercion by government sponsored terrorist groups. These groups might also threaten \nU.S. security interests. Applicant failed to provide sufficient information to rebut or \nmitigate these security concerns. I conclude that the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are inapplicable. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n  \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAppellant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 17(d) on his e-QIP. When he signed his e-\nQIP in July 2006, he had, in fact, been issued an active passport by a foreign \ngovernment. The passport had expired six years previously, in February 2000. This \ninformation raises a security concern under AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads as follows: \n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d \n \nApplicant denied his answer was a deliberate falsification, and he explained that \nwhen he answered the question, he focused on the date of issue as the time marking \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthe effective life of the passport.  If the passport was issued in 1998, he reasoned, it had \nbeen issued more than seven years before July 2006.  Applicant explained he had not \nconsulted anyone before answering the question.  I also note that Applicant\u2019s English \nlanguage skills, both written and spoken, reflected usages not common in the United \nStates.  I conclude that under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s response to Question \n17(d) was credible and his falsification was not deliberate.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is an adult of 47 years of age. He cares deeply for his mother and brothers, \nwho are citizens and residents of Sudan. He feels additional bonds of affection for his \nwife, who is a citizen of Sudan and who resides with him in United States, and his \nmother-in-law and father-in-law, who are residents and citizens of Sudan. As the only \nfamily member who has emigrated, he feels obligated to use the resources he has \nacquired as a United States citizen to help his family members in Sudan. His deep \nsense of obligation suggests he may also be vulnerable to exploitation or manipulation. \n \n Sudan is a country split by ethnic and religious division, violence, and \nlawlessness. Its leaders sponsor terrorism and target U.S. security interests. Because \nthey may be targeted by terrorists, U.S. citizens are warned not to travel to Sudan. \nUnder these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s current plan to travel to Sudan, while motivated \nby family loyalty and concern, might also expose him to the possibility of exploitation, \npressure and inducement. His sense of obligation and desire to help his Sudanese \nrelatives could make him vulnerable to exploitation and create a conflict of interest with \nhis obligation to protect classified information.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude that while Applicant mitigated security concerns arising under the foreign \npreference and personal conduct adjudicative guidelines, he failed to mitigate security \nconcerns arising under the foreign interest adjudicative guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor, working as an electrician in a naval shipyard. He has worked for his current employer since January 2007. He has never held a security clearance (Tr. 18). In high school, Applicant used marijuana and occasionally used cocaine (Tr. 52). He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1999 to August 2001, but did not use illegal drugs in the Army. After completing basic training and being assigned to a unit, he became depressed by the \u201cnegativity\u201d in his unit and the hazing he experienced as a new arrival. His fellow soldiers did not like the unit, the duty station, or the Army (Tr. 45-46, 63-65). He deserted on February 28, 2000, even though his father tried to talk him out of it. His father convinced him to surrender, and he did so on April 11, 2000 (Tr. 35). He was discharged under other than honorable conditions in lieu of court- martial (GX 3 through GX 8). Applicant was addicted to Oxycontin for about nine months in 2003. He was introduced to Oxycontin when it was prescribed for his girlfriend, who was seriously injured. Applicant took care of his girlfriend and started using Oxycontin and Dilaudid that were prescribed for her (Tr. 36",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 17, 2007. On May \n13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nNovember 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 19, 2009; answered it on June 18, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nJune 19, 2009.  \n \nOn July 10, 2009, Department Counsel amended the SOR by withdrawing the \ntwo Guideline E allegations of falsifying a security clearance application and substituting \none allegation of desertion from the U.S. Army. Applicant responded to the \namendments on July 28, 2009.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on July 24, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on July 27, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 6, 2009, \nscheduling the hearing for September 2, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and presented the testimony of one witness. The record closed upon \nadjournment of the hearing. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d \nunder Guideline H, and he admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, as amended, alleging desertion from \nthe Army. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor, working as an \nelectrician in a naval shipyard. He has worked for his current employer since January \n2007. He has never held a security clearance (Tr. 18). \n \n \nIn high school, Applicant used marijuana and occasionally used cocaine (Tr. 52). \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 1999 to August 2001, but did not \nuse illegal drugs in the Army. After completing basic training and being assigned to a \nunit, he became depressed by the \u201cnegativity\u201d in his unit and the hazing he experienced \nas a new arrival. His fellow soldiers did not like the unit, the duty station, or the Army \n(Tr. 45-46, 63-65). He deserted on February 28, 2000, even though his father tried to \ntalk him out of it. His father convinced him to surrender, and he did so on April 11, 2000 \n(Tr. 35). He was discharged under other than honorable conditions in lieu of court-\nmartial (GX 3 through GX 8). \n \n \nApplicant was addicted to Oxycontin for about nine months in 2003. He was \nintroduced to Oxycontin when it was prescribed for his girlfriend, who was seriously \ninjured. Applicant took care of his girlfriend and started using Oxycontin and Dilaudid \nthat were prescribed for her (Tr. 36, 52). His parents ejected him from the family home, \nwhere he had been living, when they found out about his drug use (Tr. 36). Applicant \nunderwent detoxification twice. After he and his girlfriend broke up, he no longer had her \nprescription drugs available, and he replaced them with heavy alcohol consumption (GX \n2 at 15; Tr. 53). He also continued to use marijuana about once a week and used \ncocaine once every other month (Tr. 53-55).  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s older brother died in October 2004, he began using heroin, and \nused it about three times a day from May to December 2005 (GX 2 at 15). He \nsuspected his brother had died from a drug overdose, but later learned that the cause of \ndeath was pneumonia (GX 2 at 23). Applicant purchased his heroin from friends or \ndealers on the street (GX 2 at 3). He incurred numerous delinquent debts, sold or \npawned all his personal property to buy drugs, and cashed in a retirement fund from a \npublic school system where he was employed (Tr. 55).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father convinced him to seek treatment (Tr. 39). He underwent drug \ntreatment from December 2005 to April 2006 (GX 2 at 11). He tested positive for \ncocaine and THC during the first week of treatment (GX 2 at 8). He was diagnosed by a \nregistered nurse and a medical doctor as suffering from opiate dependence, a \ngeneralized anxiety disorder, and a depressive disorder not otherwise specified (GX 2 \nat 17-18). His treatment consisted of three weeks of outpatient treatment, followed by \ngroup counseling sessions and individual counseling sessions with staff professionals \n(GX 2 at 8). He stopped attending the group therapy sessions in March 2006 (GX 2 at \n20), because he found the sessions unhelpful and he did not want to be around addicts \nwho were still using drugs (GX 2 at 24; Tr. 48). He last used illegal drugs when he \nrelapsed once in March 2006 (Tr. 59).  \n \nApplicant has not participated in Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, \nor any similar activity (Tr. 60). In October 2008, he was evaluated by the same \ntreatment facility he had attended in 2005-2006, and he was diagnosed as opiate \ndependent in remission (GX 2 at 13). The evaluation did not include a prognosis.  \n \nApplicant does not associate with any of the individuals with whom he used \nillegal drugs (Tr. 62). He was married in May 2007. He and his wife are expecting their \nfirst child. He enjoys his job as an electrician. He has paid off his delinquent debts and \nrecently purchased a home (Tr. 49-50). He has been taking prescription medications for \ndepression for about two years, and he sees a psychiatrist on a regular basis, about \nonce every three months (Tr. 66).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \n\n \n4 \n \n \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was addicted to Oxycontin in 2003 after using it for \nabout nine months (SOR \u00b6 1.a), used heroin about three times daily from December \n2005 to June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and tested positive for remnants of cocaine and \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleges he participated \n\n \n5 \n \n \nin a drug treatment program from December 2005 to April 2006; was diagnosed with \nopiate addiction, generalized anxiety disorder, and depressive disorder; refused to \ncontinue with the recommended individual counseling; and reported using heroin and \ndrinking excessively at his last visit before discharge (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted \nthese allegations in his answer to the SOR. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. \n \nGuideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1). Drug abuse is Athe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.@ AG \u00b6 24(b).  \n \nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for illegal drug use;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including purchase; and  \nAG \u00b6 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug \ndependence; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program \nprescribed by a duly qualified medical professional. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s evidence raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a)-(d). AG \n\u00b6 25(f) is also raised because Applicant did not complete the aftercare requirements of \nhis drug treatment program. \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a)-(d) and (f), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focusing on whether the drug involvement was recent, is a \nkey consideration in this case. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when \nconduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last drug involvement was in March 2006, more than three and a half \nyears ago. A significant period of time has passed, raising the question whether he is \nrehabilitated after his long history of intense drug abuse starting in high school. He did \nnot complete his aftercare requirements for the drug treatment program that ended in \nApril 2006, and he does not participate in Narcotics Anonymous or any similar support \ngroup. At his hearing, he seemed to be a quiet, sensitive, somewhat fragile person. On \nthe other hand, he has a supportive family, was recently married, and is awaiting the \nbirth of his first child. He has worked at a job that he finds rewarding for almost three \nyears. He no longer associates with drug users. He receives medication for his \ndepression, and he sees a psychiatrist regularly. His opiate dependence has been \ndiagnosed as in remission. He has experienced a drug-free life for a substantial period \nof time, and he has no desire to relapse to the hopeless state he experienced in \nDecember 2005. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). The evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(b)(1), (2), and (3). \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). This mitigating condition is only \npartially established. Applicant completed the outpatient treatment portion of his drug \ntreatment program, but he did not complete the aftercare requirements. The diagnosis \nas of October 2008 that he was \u201cin remission\u201d falls short of a favorable prognosis. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant deserted from the Army and was absent from his unit \nfrom February 20, 2000, to April 11, 2000, and that he was discharged in lieu of trial by \ncourt-martial for his conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a, as amended). He has admitted these \nallegations. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d The following are the \nrelevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by: \n[C]redible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by: \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of . . . disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior in the workplace. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is raised by: \n[P]ersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d) are raised by Applicant\u2019s conduct while in the Army, because \nhe demonstrated unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, questionable \njudgment, and unreliability. AG \u00b6 16(e) is raised because his desertion from the Army \nwas likely to adversely affect his standing among his neighbors, friends, co-workers, \nassociates, and his community. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct also may be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s desertion was not a minor offense, but it happened \n\n \n8 \n \n \nalmost ten years ago. It did not occur under unique circumstances. Although he is no \nlonger in the military, he could encounter stressors that would prompt him to abandon \nhis current responsibilities. However, he has obtained professional help and surrounded \nhimself with a support structure to help him cope with stress. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). This mitigating condition is established, because Applicant has \nacknowledged his behavior, obtained treatment for his depression and anxiety, and \nchanged his lifestyle. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns arising from personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). This mitigating condition is established because \nApplicant has disclosed his past and obtained treatment for his vulnerable personality \ntraits. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a relatively young man, but he appears to have left his turbulent \nadolescence and early adulthood behind him. He has obtained and held a responsible \njob, married, and obtained professional assistance to overcome his drug addiction and \n\n \n9 \n \n \nvulnerable personality traits. He was candid, remorseful, and sincere at the hearing. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, and mindful of my \nresponsibility to resolve any doubt in favor of national security, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement and personal conduct. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a (as amended):  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He was employed as a contract specialist by the government from September 1997 to January 1999 when he decided to change careers, quit work and become a full-time student. He possessed a secret level security clearance while working for the government and there is no indication he ever mishandled or compromised classified information or that any previous adverse action was ever taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance.

Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR, executed by him on March 6, 2008, in which he admitted\nthe allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, b, e, h, j and k, denied the remaining\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 24, 2008\n\n The same creditor is alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1. h. The balance owing listed in the\n2\nJanuary 9, 2008 letter from the debt collection agency handling the satisfied account matches the balance\nlisted in subparagraph 1.c. However, the account number listed in that letter matches the account number for\nthe creditor listed in subparagraph 1.h as recorded in Applicant\u2019s October 15, 2005 credit report (GE 6).\nAccordingly, it is most likely the account that has been satisfied is that which is alleged in subparagraph 1.h.\nFurther, the information listed in GE 6 for the accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.h establishes they\nare separate accounts and not duplicate entries for a single account.\n2\nallegations and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a\nhearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March 19,\n2008, that was received by Applicant on April 2, 2008. Applicant submitted a response to\nthe FORM that contained a cover letter and three additional documents. Those documents\nwere marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-4, and made part of the record without objection.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 27, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 35-year-old man who has been employed as a network engineer by\na defense contractor since August 2005. He was employed as a contract specialist by the\ngovernment from September 1997 to January 1999 when he decided to change careers,\nquit work and become a full-time student. He possessed a secret level security clearance\nwhile working for the government and there is no indication he ever mishandled  or\ncompromised classified information or that any previous adverse action was ever taken to\nrevoke or downgrade his clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s plan to finance his education was to rely on student loans, friends,\nfamily, and credit cards. In January 2001, he was hired as an intern, but that job ended in\nMay 2001 due to a workforce reduction. Discovering that he was unable to support himself\non student loans and unemployment compensation, Applicant decided to gamble in the\nstock market.

He then continued\nto rely on credit cards to support himself, to pay other credit card debt, and to repay a loan\nhe had obtained from a friend to purchase a car.\nUnable to keep up with the credit card debt he had accumulated, Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection in December 2004. His bankruptcy petition was dismissed\nin July 2005. Applicant explained the petition was dismissed \u201cpartly due to being indifferent\nin spending the money and not providing sufficient documentation.\u201d (GE 4) \nThe SOR alleges nine credit card accounts, totalling over $82,000, that have been\ncharged off. Applicant submitted proof with his answer to the SOR that he satisfied the\ndebts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.d, f, g, h, and i.  He satisfied the accounts by\n2\nnegotiating settlements for substantially less than the amount owing with the various\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

The information contained in the FORM\ndoes not establish how much Applicant paid to satisfy the $440 debt alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.d. Finally, Applicant also submitted proof he satisfied an account not\nalleged in the SOR that had been charged off in the amount of $21,014 (GE 6) by making\na payment in the amount of $13,500 in August 2006 (AE 3). \nStill outstanding, are the delinquent accounts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a-c, and\n1.e, totalling over $55,000. Applicant also owes more than $70,000 to repay student loans.\nHe is making payments in the amount of $325.40 on the student loans and is current on\nthose payments (AE 2)\nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement and a wage statement in\nresponse to interrogatories sent to him (GE 5). Those documents disclose his gross weekly\npay is $1,337.23,  $323.70 is withheld from his pay for taxes, $344.53 for insurance and\nsavings, and his net weekly pay is $578.19. His  total monthly expenses are $1,620 and\nhis net remainder is $368. He has about $1,000 in savings. (GE 5) \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\n\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id. at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n6\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n7\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n11\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant allowed nine credit card accounts, totalling more than $82,000, to become\nseverely delinquent and charged off as bad debts. Those accounts remained delinquent\nfor a number of years without any effort being made to satisfy them. Additionally, Applicant\nattempted to seek Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2004, but had his petition dismissed\nby the court based due to his indifferent spending habits and inability to produce required\ndocumentation. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; and DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \nApplicant did satisfy one delinquent creditor that is not listed in the SOR in August\n2006. He recently obtained a loan from his employer, negotiated reduced payments with\nfour creditors, and has now satisfied those debts. A fifth account has also been satisfied,\nalthough it cannot be determined if that creditor was paid in full or through a negotiated\nsettlement. Applicant\u2019s wage and personal financial statements indicate he is now living\n\n5\nwithin his means and may have the potential to resolve his remaining debts and assume\na financially responsible lifestyle. However, as alleged in the SOR, Applicant still has four\ndelinquent accounts outstanding, totalling over $55,000. \nWhile Applicant has taken steps to begin to resolve his financial problems they are\ncurrently ongoing. The debts were caused by the poor decisions Applicant freely chose to\nmake, such as quitting a job and pursuing higher education without first making adequate\nfinancial arrangements to do so, and then deciding to obtain funds from credit cards to\ngamble in the stock market in an effort to support himself. He has not received debt\ncounselling, and, although he initiated a good-faith effort to repay some overdue creditors,\nthere is no indication he has taken any steps to resolve others. I have considered all\nmitigating conditions and none apply.     \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the\nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying conditions. Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concern caused by the financial considerations present in this case. He has failed\nto overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline\nF is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph   1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph   1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f-i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.j & k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n\n6\n\n",

Applicant\u2019s \nstatement of reasons (SOR) lists 11 delinquent debts, totaling $14,859. Because of \nduplications, she had seven delinquent debts totaling about $9,500. Applicant settled \nand paid her SOR debts. She does not currently have any delinquent debt. Clearance is \ngranted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nIn December 2006, Applicant submitted an undated Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Tr. 55; GE \n1). On April 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an \nSOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \nApril 22, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn May 16, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March \n23, 2009. The case was assigned to me on March 25, 2009. On March 26, 2009, DOHA \nissued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 6, 2009. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered five exhibits (GEs 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 20-22), and \nApplicant offered five exhibits (Tr. 23-27, 48-49; AE A-E). There were no objections, and \nI admitted GEs 1-5 (Tr. 22), and AEs A-E (Tr. 27, 48-49). Additionally, I admitted the \nSOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 6-8). I received the transcript \non April 15, 2009. I received a letter from a character witness (AE F) after the hearing \nand the letter was admitted without objection (AE F). I closed the record on April 20, \n2009 (Tr. 12-13).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted her responsibility for the debts listed in \nthe SOR; however, she said some debts were duplications (GE 8). She also provided \nproof some debts were paid, settled and paid, or otherwise resolved. Her admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 28 years old (Tr. 6, 28). In 2002, she received her bachelor\u2019s degree \nin psychology with a minor in criminal justice (Tr. 6, 28). In 2003, she moved to a \ndifferent state and worked as a social worker (Tr. 29). She has worked for a government \ncontractor as a financial systems analyst since 2006 (Tr. 29). She married in April 2003 \n(Tr. 31). Her husband has been in the U.S. Navy for nine years (Tr. 60). He is a \nLieutenant in the U.S. Navy (Tr. 31, 56). Her husband is a pilot (Tr. 32). She does not \nhave any children (Tr. 31). She is seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 30). \n \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 11 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.k), totaling $14,859. Because of duplications, she actually had seven delinquent \ndebts, totaling about $9,500. Applicant incurred delinquent debts in 1999 when she was \nin college (Tr. 19). She was ill and missed work for about three weeks causing her to fall \nbehind on her payments to her creditors (Tr. 20, 50-51; AE E). After her illness, she \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nchanged employment; however, her new employment paid a lower salary (Tr. 51-52). \nShe moved and she lost contact with her creditors (Tr. 20). After she moved to a \ndifferent state, her pay was still low because she worked as a social worker (Tr. 53).  \n \nApplicant established through her hearing statement and the documents she \nprovided that her SOR debts were all resolved. The resolution of her SOR debts is more \nspecifically described as follows:  \n \n(1) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($2,075), 1.j ($2,033) and 1.k ($2,096) are \nduplications of the same account. This credit card account was settled for $1,200. \nApplicant made $600 payments on May 8 and 16, 2008 (Tr. 33-34, 43-44, 46; GE 8 at \n1, 3, 5; AE A at 1, 2, 3, 12, 13). Applicant sent several letters to the creditor to obtain \nproof that the accounts were duplications; however, she did not receive replies (Tr. 43-\n44). I accept her statement that the accounts are duplications as credible (Tr. 43-44);  \n \n(2) This department store account of $566, was settled for $469. She paid $469 \non May 8, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 35; GE 8 at 1, 6; AE A at 1, 2, 3);  \n \n(3) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($956) and 1.f ($957) are the same debt. This credit \ncard debt was settled and paid as follows: $282 paid on March 21, 2008, and $225 paid \non April 16, 2008 (Tr. 35-38, 40; GE 2 at 3; GE 8 at 2, 7, 8; AE A at 4, 8);  \n \n(4) This credit card debt of $2,059, was settled for $1,100, and Applicant made \npayments as follows: $200 on March 21, 2008, $225 on April 16, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d, GE \n8 at 2). The creditor provided a letter indicating this debt was paid (Tr. 38; AE A at 5);  \n \n(5) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($343) and 1.h ($258) are the same debt, and they \npertain to a clothing store account. This credit card debt was settled for $300 and paid \non May 8, 2008 (Tr. 38-40; GE 8 at 2, 9, 10; AE A at 6, 7, 10). Although Applicant did \nnot have documentation proving these two accounts were duplications of each other, \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.h could not find the account (Tr. 41-42). I accept her statement \nthat the accounts are duplications as credible (Tr. 41-42);  \n \n(6) This credit card debt of $2,627, was settled for $1,383, and she provided \nproof of payments made as follows: $433 on March 21, 2008, and $225 on April 16, \n2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Tr. 41; GE 8 at 2; AE A at 9). A letter from the creditor, dated March \n12, 2009, indicates the account is resolved (Tr. 41; AE A at 9);  \n \n(7) This department store account for $889 was settled for $642. Applicant paid \nthis debt on March 18, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.i; Tr. 43; GE 8 at 3, 15, 16; AE A at 11).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary from her employment as a government contractor has tripled \nfrom when she started working for the contractor, and she is now earning about $55,000 \nannually (Tr. 31, 53). She earns an additional $600 monthly from her part-time \nemployment as an aerobics instructor (Tr. 30, 31). Her husband\u2019s annual salary is about \n$54,000. Applicant and her husband have ample income for their lifestyle and save \n\n \n \n4 \n \nabout $1,500 monthly (Tr. 58). They have retained about $3,000 in their checking \naccount, $10,000 in their savings account, and $20,000 in certificates of deposit, as \n\u201crainy day\u201d funds (Tr. 58-60). She has one credit card and it is current (Tr. 61). Credit \nreports in March 2008, June 2008, and March 2009, do not show any currently \ndelinquent accounts (Tr. 61-62, 64; GE 3-5). \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend has known Applicant for more than 20 years (AE F). She has \nattended the same schools with Applicant. She has closely followed Applicant\u2019s career \nafter Applicant completed college. She vouches for Applicant\u2019s honesty, integrity and \ntrustworthiness. She recommends approval of Applicant\u2019s security clearance (AE F). \n \nAnother character witness has known Applicant since 2005 (AE D). She lauds \nApplicant\u2019s intelligence, organizational skills, trustworthiness, and high ethical \nstandards. She recommends Applicant for a security clearance (AE D). \n  \nApplicant provided two performance evaluations, which showed her solid work \nproduct (AE B and C). She is a hard worker, who is progressing in her development. \nShe has strong ratings in job knowledge and communication skills. She maintains the \nhighest professional standards.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n \n5 \n \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her SOR response and at her \nhearing. In 1999, she fell behind on some of her credit cards and department store \naccounts. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.k, she had 11 delinquent debts, totaling \n$14,859. Because of duplications, the she actually had seven delinquent debts, totaling \nabout $9,500. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) or \n20(e) because she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. Her delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives \npartial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) because her financial problems initially \nresulted when she was ill and unable to work. After her illness, she was underemployed \nfor several years. Her delinquent debts also \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Moreover, she established that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, when she paid or settled and paid all of the \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \ndelinquent SOR debts.2 AG \u00b6 20(e) does not fully apply because she did not dispute all \nof her SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does fully apply to the debts that were duplications. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) fully applies. Applicant paid or settled and paid her delinquent debts. \nThere are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d She \nunderstands the security implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid \nfuture delinquent debt. She has also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because \nshe showed good faith3 in the resolution of her SOR debts.    \n \nAlthough Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve her delinquent debts, her payment of the remaining SOR debts is \nadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n8 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. In 1999, Applicant\u2019s \ndebts became delinquent because of her brief illness. However, years passed without \nresolution of her delinquent debts. The SOR lists 11 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.k), totaling $14,859. Because of duplications, she actually had seven debts, totaling \nabout $9,500 that were at one time or another delinquent during the last four years. She \nfailed to keep her accounts current and negotiate lesser payments when her income \ndecreased, showing some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. When she \nreturned to full employment, she did not aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution. \nHer history of delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. She is a law-abiding citizen. A brief \nmedical illness caused her income to significantly decline, and her credit card accounts \nbecame delinquent. Ultimately, she paid or settled and paid her delinquent SOR debts. \nHer remaining debts, such as one credit card, and car payments are current. She and \nher husband have savings and certificates of deposit totaling about $30,000. The \nAppeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in financial \ncases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \n\n \n \n9 \n \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is 28 years old. She has earned her bachelor\u2019s degree. She had worked for a \ngovernment contractor as a financial systems analyst since 2006 and her salary from \nthe contractor has tripled from when she started working for the contractor. She now \nearns about $62,000 annually (includes her part-time employment as an aerobics \ninstructor). She married in April 2003. Her husband is a Lieutenant in the U.S. Navy, \nand has an annual salary of about $54,000. She made mistakes, and debts became \ndelinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust her. Moreover, she has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments by actually paying all of her \ndelinquent SOR debts. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \nShe has demonstrated her loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through her service to \nthe Department of Defense as a defense contractor and through her support of her \nhusband, a Naval officer. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and \nall the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.k: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nTerry E. Rector, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 12, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 29, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which established that his\nproblems were due to his own naivete, and his reliance on his wife, who had serious physical and\nemotional issues and was taking substantial prescription medications.  In support of his contention,\nApplicant notes that he has never compromised classified information.  He also cites to four hearing-\nlevel cases in which applicants in ostensibly similar circumstances were granted clearances.\nApplicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.\nThe Board gives due consideration to the cases cited by Applicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n06-05903 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  However, the Board has previously noted that decisions\nin other hearing-level cases are not legally binding precedent, even if an applicant can establish close\nfactual similarities between those cases and his case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  Accordingly, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile his decision in this\ncase with decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 31, 2006).  \u201cThe adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables\nknown as the whole-person concept.\u201d  Directive at \u00b6 E2.2(a).  \u201cEach case must be judged on its own\nmerits . . .\u201d Id at \u00b6 E2.2(b).\nThe Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under\nany of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-22325 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2004).  Security clearance determinations are not limited to consideration of\nwork performance or conduct during duty hours.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJul. 29, 2005).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails\nto safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See\nAdams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The absence of security violations does\nnot bar or preclude an adverse security clearance decision.  See ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App.\nBd. Dec. 13, 2005).\n \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant as to SOR paragraphs 1(c), (e), (f), and (j).  Those favorable findings\n1\nare not at issue on appeal.\n3\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations, including the failure to pay federal taxes.  At the time the case was submitted for\ndecision, Applicant still had significant outstanding debt, and was still trying to resolve his financial\nproblems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were\nstill ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed\nthe mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  She found in\nfavor of Applicant as to several of the SOR allegations.   However, she reasonably explained why\n1\nthe mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board\ndoes not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that\nthe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision,\n\u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle\nMfrs.

On May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 16, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 13, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE 1-4), which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf, and presented the testimony of three witnesses. He submitted Exhibit (AE A),\nAugust 29, 2008\n\n2\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript on August 21, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 16, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, and 1.f, of the SOR. He denied the other allegations in the SOR\nbecause the debts were paid or he had no knowledge of them. He provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1975. He married in September 1976, and had one son from that\nmarriage. Applicant served in the Air Force from 1976 until 1996. He had a top secret\nclearance for his entire career. He has been employed since 1998 with the same\nemployer (GE 1).\nApplicant and his wife of 32 years did not share the duties for the household\nfinances. His wife handled the financial matters and Applicant claims he had no reason\nto question her management. His wife had a contract for a catering business from 1998\nuntil 2007 (Tr. 16). Applicant and his wife had an accountant complete their personal\ntaxes and handle the business matters for the income from the catering contract (Tr.\n17).\nApplicant\u2019s wife had several falls over the years. This resulted in back problems\nand other medical problems. In 2000, she was on various medications. She was also\ninvolved in an automobile accident in 2002 which disabled her. She still has problems\ntoday with her back. In 2002, she suffered a heart attack. She had open heart surgery in\n2006. In May 2007, the couple lost their only son in an automobile accident (GE 2). In\nJanuary 2008, she had another surgery (Tr. 18). She had to stop her work in the\ncatering business in 2007. She has more back surgery scheduled. \nWhen Applicant retired from the military in 1996, he had some difficulty in living\non his retirement pension of $13,000 per year. He and his wife had a number of credit\ncard bills that they could not continue to pay. She acknowledged that they had too many\ncredit cards and could not make minimum payments. They went to a credit counselor\nand filed for bankruptcy in 1998 (Tr. 27). They did not timely file taxes for the years\n2004, 2005 and 2006. When they did file their taxes, it was a joint return (Tr. 38).\nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in March 2008. He addressed the\nitems listed in the SOR by referring to his tax attorney whom he contacted in 2007. He\nacknowledged that the federal tax liens had not been satisfied. He explained that the\nfederal tax returns for 2004, 2005, and 2006 were filed in August 2007 (GE 2).\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified at the hearing that she did not learn about the IRS tax liens\nuntil 2006. However, she knew they had tax problems from 2002 (Tr. 43). In fact, they\nhave been paying on the 2002-2003 taxes through an installment agreement.\nApplicant\u2019s wife stated they obtained a credit report every year beginning in 2005 or\n\n3\n2006, but then did not know that the federal liens existed. The two liens appear on the\n2006 credit report (GE 4). Applicant\u2019s wife at times contradicted her testimony and\nseemed confused and vague about the financial issues although she was adamant that\nshe took care of the finances rather than Applicant (Tr. 41). At one point, Applicant\u2019s\nwife thought the first time that she spoke to the IRS about tax issues may have been\n2000 or 2001 (Tr. 62). \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts/ collection accounts including, two federal\ntax liens, one judgment, one unpaid medical debt and six collection accounts. The total\namount of the delinquent debt is approximately $41,335.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a tax lien levied by the IRS in December 2004 in the amount of\n$20,742. Applicant denied this debt because he paid his taxes and the liens were the\nresult of his wife\u2019s taxes (despite the fact that they filed a joint tax return). At the\nhearing, Applicant admitted that he owed the debt. He is working with a tax attorney to\nresolve this matter.\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a tax lien levied by the IRS in March 2003 in the amount of\n$11,457. He also denied this because he paid his taxes. He acknowledges that he and\nhis wife filed a joint return but she was self-employed. He admits that he owes the debt.\nHe is working with a tax attorney to resolve this matter.\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a civil judgment granted against him in the amount of $687.\nApplicant denied this debt. Applicant and his wife believe someone paid this amount but\nit was not either of them (Tr. 44).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a charged-off account in the amount of $314. Applicant believed\nthis amount was paid to the creditor but does not have a receipt.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a medical provider collection account in the amount of $50.\nApplicant paid this bill in March 2008.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a charged off account in 2004 for the amount of $3,253.\nApplicant admits this bill. He settled this account on May 16, 2008 (AE A).\nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a charged off account in the amount of $1,060. He denied this\nbill. Applicant\u2019s wife does not have any knowledge of this account (Tr. 52). He called the\ncredit collection company but he does not have any documentation that he disputed the\namount (Tr. 138). \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is another charged off account in the amount of $371 for which\nApplicant has no knowledge. However, in his security clearance application he stated he\ndisputed this amount and has refused to pay (GE 1).\nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a charged off account in the amount of $956. Applicant does not\nhave any knowledge of this account.\n\n4\nSOR \u00b61.j is a charged off account in the amount of $2,445 for a credit account.\nApplicant paid this bill through the use of another credit card (Tr. 160).\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $4,610, which includes his military\nretirement of $13,000. After monthly expenses, he has approximately $800. He is\ncurrently making minimum payments on other credit cards (Tr.121). He is current with\nhis car payments. He has no bank savings. He has no idea what he has in a checking\naccount. He detailed that he has already borrowed $25,000 against his retirement fund\n(Tr.128). The $25,000 is gone and Applicant could not account for it. He did state that\nhe gave it to his wife and it is now gone. He has no budget.\nIn May 2007, Applicant and his wife obtained the services of a tax attorney to\nhelp with resolving taxes due on the catering business (Tr. 20). The tax attorney\naddressed the joint 2004 and 2005 federal taxes that Applicant and his wife had filed\nbut not paid. He made an abatement request for penalties due to the medical hardships\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife faced (Tr. 68). The tax attorney explained that since Applicant was\nan employee his taxes were regularly deducted from his pay. However, his wife had a\n1099 but did not make estimated tax payments. The IRS has not responded to the\nrequest (Tr. 69). Due to their son\u2019s death in 2007, Applicant and his wife did not file the\n2006 return. They did file the 2007 return and their refund of $3,150 was applied to the\nold taxes. They now voluntarily send the IRS money (Tr. 71). The tax attorney advised\nApplicant and his wife that their former accountant should have deducted expenses and\nthat the tax owed is artificially high. The tax attorney had no knowledge of the two\nfederal tax liens (Tr. 76).\nWhen Applicant completed his security application in 2006, he checked on his\ncredit report and saw that two liens from the IRS were listed against his property. He did\nnot know they existed before this. However, he did know that they owed taxes to the\nfederal government from 2003 and were paying on them (Tr. 95). Applicant discussed\nthe liens with his wife and learned that she had not filed the 2006 taxes (Tr. 97).\nApplicant submitted his tax returns for 2005 and 2006 as part of his response to\ninterrogatories. He listed gambling losses on both income tax returns for $3,069 and for\n$10,416 respectively (Tr. 148).\nApplicant was vague and unsure about many of the financial issues at the\nhearing. He was not certain about the first year that they failed to pay the IRS taxes\ndue. He testified that he assumed his wife was taking care of everything and making\ninstallment payments to the IRS. He did not bring any tax documents to the hearing and\ndid not bring any correspondence from the IRS to the hearing. He relied on the tax\nattorney. The tax attorney did not know about the tax liens that were listed in the SOR.\nApplicant admitted that he briefly looked at the documents that the Government had\nsent him for the case. He acknowledged that in 2006, his earnings were $116,611.\nApplicant acknowledged that his total debt is $174,000 including his mortgage and car\npayments, including the debts in the SOR. He could not explain what if any amount they\nhad in their checking account. He does not have a savings account. He does have his\nretirement account ($59,000) but he borrowed $25,000 against it in January 2008 (Tr.\n\n5\n128). He was not clear about how the money was applied. Except for some legal fees\nand one $3,500 debt, he recalls giving the money to his wife (Tr. 130). \nApplicant\u2019s military career spanned more than 20 years. His supervisor testified\nthat he has known Applicant for 30 years. They were in the Air Force together. He hired\nApplicant and notes that he has never compromised security. He handles classified\ninformation properly and is a person of trust. He believes that the financial situation is\nnot affecting Applicant\u2019s work performance or ability to handle classified information.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\n\n6\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has delinquent debts and two tax liens, judgments and\ncould not meet his financial obligations from 2002-2007. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries are partially the result of his wife\u2019s business tax not being\npaid. However, they always filed a joint return. He still has unresolved tax debts and\ncollection accounts. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems may have began with his wife\u2019s illness and business tax problems but\nthe inquiry does not end there. The tragedy of their only son\u2019s death in 2007 is not\noverlooked or minimized. But many of the financial problems were in place before 2007.\n\n7\nApplicant did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. He did not\ntake a stance when he learned about the tax issues. I find this potentially mitigating\ncondition does not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This does not apply. Applicant has no budget\nand has had no financial counseling. He is paying one debt with a loan from a credit\ncard. He does not have a handle on his financial affairs. His contact in 2007 with the tax\nattorney and his position that the problem is his wife\u2019s tax not his is irresponsible. He\ntook out a loan of $25,000 against his retirement account and gave it to his wife. He is\nnot able to account for the money. \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant problems\nwere caused by an inattention to his financial affairs.  He and his wife did start making\ninstallment payments to the IRS a few years ago but have not resolved the liens or put\nany plan into action. They did not seek the help of a tax attorney until 2007. He did not\nactively pursue any of the credit collection accounts.  I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition partially applies.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebts were his wife\u2019s but he understands that legally he is responsible for them through\nthe marriage. He did not have knowledge of many of them. I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant retired from the Air Force after 20 years of service. He has held a top\nsecret clearance during his military career and his defense contract career. He has the\nrecommendation of his supervisor. His supervisor is aware of his financial issue and\nbelieves it has not affected Applicant\u2019s work in any way. He praised Applicant for his\ncapability and work knowledge. He has known Applicant for 30 years in a professional\nand a personal capacity and has no reservations about recommending him.\nApplicant had some financial difficulties when he retired from the military. He\nreceived a military pension and found employment but had outstanding credit card debt\nthat he could not pay. His wife had worked with a contract for a catering business. But\nshe had many medical problems over the years, including many surgeries. Her tax\naccountant did not take legitimate business deductions and Applicant did not pay\nestimated taxes. She owed taxes and was not able to pay them. She could not work\nafter 2007. However, Applicant and his wife filed joint tax returns. \nApplicant and his wife suffered a great tragedy with the sudden death of their\nonly son in 2007. However, the financial issues arose prior to this tragedy. Applicant\u2019s\nreliance on the fact that his wife handled all the financial affairs does not absolve him in\nthis matter. His wife did not pay taxes and Applicant is responsible as well. He knew\nabout an installment arrangement for the IRS but did not take an active stance to\nresolve or alleviate problems. He and his wife used credit and did not plan or budget.\nApplicant recently took out a hardship loan against his retirement fund. He does not\nknow where all the money went. He and his wife have been making payments on the\ntaxes but were not sure of the status. They hired a tax attorney in 2007 but he is not\nfully aware of Applicant\u2019s tax situation. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on June 18, 2008, admitted all of the allegations,\nexcept SOR subparagraph 1.k, and requested an administrative determination.

In 2001, she took a pleasure trip to Europe (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\n\n3\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d Applicant presented no evidence of any circumstances beyond her control\nthat contributed to her financial difficulties. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not\napply. She disputed one of her medical delinquencies, but provided no documentation\neither substantiating the basis of the dispute, or detailing actions to resolve the issue.\nSimilarly, her contention that the bill may have resulted from an errant calculation by her\nhealth insurance provider was not supported by any documentary evidence, either. AG\n20(e), \u201c the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d does not\napply.\nApplicant contacted her student loan creditor and entered into a payment plan.\nShe provided evidence of a payment made during the month she entered the plan, but\ndid not provide any evidence of subsequent payments. Consequently, neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20\n(c), \u201c . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d nor 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\n\n4\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall commonsense judgment\nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe record contains scant evidence detailing the cause of her financial problems\nor her efforts at financial rehabilitation. Consequently, the likelihood of continuation\nremains unacceptably high. Upon considering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nfinancial consideration security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n\n5\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn November 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 18, 2007, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on February 19, 2008. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant on February 27, 2008, and it was received on March 4, 2008. \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit any \nadditional information. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a and 1.c in the SOR. He denied the remaining \nallegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \nstatements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since January \n2006. He is presently married and twice divorced. He has two children, one who is an \nadult and the other is 13 years old.  \n \n \nApplicant admits he owed the debt in SOR 1.a for a car repossession incurred in \nApril 2001, in the amount of $11,501. He has not provided any information or \ndocuments to show he has paid this debt or has been paying this debt. In response to \nquestion 27 on Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) (dated June 19, 2007), \nreferencing this debt Applicant stated:  \n \n \nWhen I checked my credit this showing 3 times. This is due to come off \nmy credit in 4/2008 because of lack of work and pay I had to make a \ndecision to either eat or pay for a car I couldn\u2019t afford to drive [so I] gave \nthe car back and made arrangements with the finance company.1  \n \nHe did not provide any information about his payment arrangements or provide any \nproof that he has paid the debt. \n \n \nApplicant admits he owes the debt in SOR 1.c to a collection agency for $673. As \nof July 7, 2007, this debt is still owed. Applicant stated on his SCA in reference to this \ndebt the following:  \n \n \nThis will show up on my report at least 2 more times because passing \nfrom one collection agency to another. This is due to come off my credit \nreport by 3-2008. Again it was a [choice] between eating or paying this bill \nand [I] tried to make arrangements but the finance company was not \nwilling to work with me.2  \n \nApplicant has not provided any information or documents to show he has paid this debt \nor has been paying this debt. \n \n \n1 Item 4 at p. 32. \n \n2 Id. at p. 33. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant denies he owes the debts in SOR 1.b, 1.d. and 1.e. The debts listed in \n1.d and 1. e are judgments. The judgment for debt 1.d was entered on October 19, \n2000, in the amount of $962. This debt is accruing interest at 9%, so balance owed will \nobviously be greater.3 The judgment for debt 1.e was entered on April 15, 1999, in the \namount of $341. This debt is accruing interest at 9%, so the balance owed will be \ngreater.4 Applicant\u2019s response to these debts that he denied in the SOR is the following: \n\u201cI am providing a credit report showing that I don\u2019t owe or have paid off the following: \n[1.b, 1.d, and 1.e].\u201d This statement contradicts the judgment documents.5 Applicant did \nnot provide any documents to show he has paid both judgments or paid the debt listed \nin 1.b ($1,142).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR stated:  \n \nIt is a fact that I didn\u2019t use my credit wisely in the past. I fully accept \nresponsibility for not making wise decisions. This, however, shouldn\u2019t \nreflect on my character or what kind of person I am. If you look at my \ncredit history from 2002 until the present you will see that I have been \nmuch more responsible in regard to making monetary decisions.6 \n \nOn his SCA Applicant lists he was unemployed from January 2004 to January 2006. He \nprovided no other information regarding his financial or employment issues.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n3 Item 7. \n \n4 Item 8. \n \n5 Items 7 and 8. \n \n6 Answer. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has three \ndelinquent debts and two judgments that remain unpaid. Despite being aware of them \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthey have been unpaid for many years. He did not provide any proof that he has paid \nany of them. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d), (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d), and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts. He alluded to the debts being incurred \nduring a period of unemployment, but he did not elaborate on the specifics of why he \nhas not taken any action on them since then. At least some of them were incurred while \nhe was employed. He has been employed at his present job since January 2006. There \nis no evidence that despite his employment issues he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Therefore I find (a) and (b) are not applicable. There is no evidence \nApplicant received counseling to assist him in resolving his financial problems. There \nare no indications the problems are being resolved or that he has initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay his creditors. It appears Applicant\u2019s attitude is that because some debts \nwere due to drop off his credit report, or have since dropped off, then he is not \nresponsible for paying them. Despite the legal implication of debts being removed from \na credit report after seven years, it does not show Applicant has acted responsibly \ntoward his just debts. He stated in his answer that certain debts were paid or no longer \nowed, but provided no proof as to this claim. In fact two of the debts are judgments that \nwere entered in 1999 and 2000 and continue to accrue interest. I find none of the \nremaining mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \n\n \n6 \n \n \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant incurred debts that \nbecame delinquent. Two of the debts have judgments that were entered prior to his \nperiod of unemployment. He has not provided any proof that he has paid any of the \ndebts in the SOR. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Background Applicant is married and has one 12-year-old son. He earned a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering in 1984, and a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering from accredited universities (see Item 1). Applicant was employed in the engineering field from 1996 to October 2004 and in February 2005. In 2001, Applicant and two individuals formed a partnership (A Group) for the sole purpose of constructing and operating an ice skating facility in their state. Each of the individuals committed different amounts of capital to the enterprise (with Applicant committing the largest monetary share: $100,000, as compared to $25,000 each for the other individuals), but shared equal percentages of ownership in the venture (see Item. 3). Applicant and his partners all shared a lifelong interest in ice hockey and were actively involved in the sport at both the youth and adult levels, as participants, coaches, and referees (Items 3 and 5). 2 To fund his portion of the funds needed to capitalize A Group, Applicant arranged a second mortgage on his home from B Bank.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 6, 2009, and elected to have his case  \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on September 1, 2009, and responded within the time permitted with \nsupplemental documentation. The case was assigned to me on October 15, 2009. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 29, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the government alleges that Applicant was ordered to pay a \njudgment of $75,000 to a corporation.  The SOR alleges that a judgment was formally \nentered against Applicant in July 2005, in the approximate amount of $75,000, and \nremains unsatisfied.   \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations and explained the \ncircumstances that gave rise to litigation between himself and his partners on one side, \nand the corporate entity who sued them over a naming rights dispute associated with \nthe building of a local hockey rink, and who ultimately prevailed with a judgment, holding \nApplicant and his co-obligors jointly and severally liable. Applicant claims he appealed \nthe judgment and was unsuccessful. He claimed he was a well-regarded engineering \nprofessional with his employer and an active civic member of his community. He \nclaimed he had been unsuccessful in trying to settle or arrange a payment resolution of \nthe judgment with the judgment creditor. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow. \n \nBackground \n \n \nApplicant is married and has one 12-year-old son. He earned a bachelor's \ndegree in industrial engineering in 1984, and a master\u2019s degree in industrial engineering \nfrom accredited universities (see Item 1). Applicant was employed in the engineering \nfield from 1996 to October 2004 and in February 2005.  \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant and two individuals formed a partnership (A Group) for the \nsole purpose of constructing and operating an ice skating facility in their state. Each of \nthe individuals committed different amounts of capital to the enterprise (with Applicant \ncommitting the largest monetary share: $100,000, as compared to $25,000 each for the \nother individuals), but shared equal percentages of ownership in the venture (see Item. \n3). Applicant and his partners all shared a lifelong interest in ice hockey and were \nactively involved in the sport at both the youth and adult levels, as participants, \ncoaches, and referees (Items 3 and 5).  \n \n \n2 \n \n \n\n \n \nTo fund his portion of the funds needed to capitalize A Group, Applicant arranged \na second mortgage on his home from B Bank. With the $150,000 in raised capital, A \nGroup was able to acquire (subject to a senior mortgage) the land necessary for the \nfacility, secure the necessary construction plans and engineering studies, and complete \nmarket studies that reflected the need and viability of the project. While the forming A \nGroup partners were able to secure other financial investors during this start-up phase, \nthe contributions of these prospective investors were deferred pending receipt of the \nnecessary approvals to proceed with the project.  \n \n \nAfter protracted negotiations, A Group reached agreement with RA that \nextended, inter alia, exclusive naming and broadcasting rights to RA with respect to the \nproposed ice skating facility (see Items 5 and 6). In return, RA committed to paying A \nGroup $2 million in six installments. After the initial $300,000 in RA outlays to A Group \nunder their agreement, RA committed to paying the remaining $1.7 million upon \nachievement of certain construction goals (e.g., ground-breaking, completion of exterior \nwalls and roof, 30 days preceding the first scheduled event, and the date the first public \nevent was held). Several contingencies were included in the agreement as well, \nincluding a ground-breaking date of September 2001 (Items 5 and 6). \n \n \nApplicant and his partners each executed separate personal guaranty \nagreements with RA (see Item 5). Each partner guaranteed A Group's obligations under \nthe terms of their agreement with RA up to $75,000, and permitted RA to take judgment \nagainst each partner in the event of a default. Each of the guarantors, in turn, were \nentitled to release from their guaranty obligations when A Group obtained a loan \ncommitment which obligated RA to pay A Group the final installment called for under \ntheir agreement (see Item 3).  \n \n \nSoon after finalization of A Group's agreement with RA, A Group obtained a loan \ncommitment from its lender (B Bank) in the amount of $4.4 million. When A Group \nforwarded the loan commitment to RA, RA paid the last installment ($125,000) to A \nGroup but refused to satisfy a condition set by B Bank that RA either escrow its \nobligations or provide a letter of credit. RA also failed to agree to several alternative \n(and more moderate) security provisions suggested by A Group and B Bank.  As a \nresult, B Bank withdrew its loan commitment, and A Group forfeited a $50,000 loan \napplication fee (Item 3).  \n \n \nUnable to obtain bank financing, A Group could not continue on with its project \nand meet the other time-lines agreed to with RA. A Group and RA ultimately resolved \ntheir stalemate in February 2002 with an amendment to their agreement, which \npostponed A Group's ground-breaking deadline until September 2002. Their \namendment also conditioned A Group's next installment payment ($200,000) on A \nGroup's obtaining new financing without additional security provisions (Item 3). \n \n3 \n \n \n\n \n \n \nDespite A Group's obtaining new financing, RA gave notice to A Group in \nSeptember 2002 that it was terminating the agreement for A Group's failure to meet the \nSeptember 2001 ground-breaking dead-line (disputed by A Group) and demanded \nreturn of the $300,000 total payments RA had made to A Group under its agreement. \nBrief negotiations ensued between the parties, but ultimately failed to produce any new \namendments to the agreement.  \n \n \nIn October 2002, RA notified A Group of its intent to terminate the agreement and \nrepeated its demand for reimbursement of the $300,000 in total payments it had \npreviously made to A Group (ex. 3). Without any financing option available to it, A \nGroup was forced to sell the land it had acquired for the ice skating facility. Records \ndocument that the buyer (C Realty) of the land ultimately developed the property as an \nice skating facility, which is currently operating.  \n \nLitigation between the parties \n \n \nFollowing C Realty's closing of its purchase of the project\u2019s land from A group, \nRA (in  March 2003), A Group was able to settle with most of its creditors and received \nabout $40,000 in cash and a $100,000 installment note in net proceeds from the sale, \npayable to Applicant and the other remaining member (Item. 3).  Approximately $25,000 \nof the cash proceeds were paid to a withdrawing member of A Group to cover his \ncapital investment, in accordance with the A Group agreement\u2019s terms.  Applicant \nreceived $10,000 of the remaining cash proceeds; while the remaining member \nreceived $5,000 (see Item 3). \n \n \nIn March 2003, RA filed suit against A Group, its three individual members, and \nC Realty, claiming A Group breached its naming rights agreement and was obligated, \nalong with C Realty, to repay the $300,000 previously paid to it by RA (Items 3 and 6).  \nThe complaint claimed Applicant and the three investors of A Group were obligated, \njointly and severally, to RA under their $75,000 guaranty (see Items 3 and 6). \n \n \nApplicant and the other named defendants in RA\u2019s suit denied liability and \ncounterclaimed, claiming they were not obligated to RA in any way because the \nguaranty agreement they executed released them from any obligations under the \nguaranty upon their obtaining a bank loan commitment that required RA to pay the \nrequired $125,000 installment (see Items 3, 7, and 9). A Group\u2019s obtained bank loan \ncommitment, in turn, triggered RA\u2019s requirement to pay the $125,000 installment called \nfor in their agreement with RA.   \n \n \nWhile the district court hearing the case dismissed C Realty from the \nproceedings (holding it not liable to any RA claims), it held A Group liable to RA in the \n \n4 \n \n \n\n \namount of $300,000 plus interest, and Applicant and the other investors liable on their \nguaranties, jointly and severally (holding the bank\u2019s loan proposal was not the type of \nloan commitment contemplated by the naming rights agreement between A group and \nRA (see ex. 3). \n \n \nJudgments were entered against A Group and the individual guarantors \n(inclusive of Applicant) in February 2006 (see Items 3 and 7). These judgments were \nsustained on appeal, and Applicant was determined to be jointly and severally liable to \nRA in the amount of $75,000 (Item 8). RA ultimately recovered $85,000 from C Realty \non the separate garnishment action it initiated against C Realty to recover monies owed \nunder the assigned $100,000 note A Group received from Applicant (Item 3).  \n \nSettlement initiatives \n \n \nInitial settlement efforts between Applicant and RA to settle the latter\u2019s claims \nagainst A Group and the individual guarantors were unsuccessful.  Without sufficient \nfunds of his own at the time to satisfy the judgment, Applicant was not able to make any  \npayments. more recently, Applicant satisfied his personal judgment liability with RA \n(Item 3).  In July 2009, a local mortgage company approved Applicant\u2019s refinancing \napplication with conditions. These conditions included the release of Applicant from his \njudgment liability.  RA supported Applicant\u2019s refinancing application and agreed to \naccept $20,000 from Applicant from the proceeds of Applicant\u2019s proposed mortgage \nrefinance, as full settlement of its claims against him pursuant to its judgments against A \nGroup and Applicant personally. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage company accepted RA\u2019s settlement proposal and \ncompleted its refinancing of Applicant\u2019s home in August 2009.  Applicant, in turn, \nsatisfied the settlement terms specified by RA, and RA filed its satisfaction of judgment \nin August 2009 (see Applicant\u2019s response to FORM). \n \nCharacter references \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors and colleagues.  He has been an \nactive member of his community.  He continues to teach in his community, and has \nrefereed ice hockey for more than 25 years.  He has been a boy scout/cub scout leader \nfor the past seven years and has been an excellent role model for his own 12-year-old \nson. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that \n \n5 \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many \nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place \nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the \ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and \nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent \nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed \nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be \nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication \npolicy concerns are pertinent herein: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \n\n \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nBurden of Proof \n \n \nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for \nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest. Because the Directive requires administrative \njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, \nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, \nin large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial \nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and \nlogical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual \ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not \nrequire the government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually \nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security \nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n \n \nOnce the government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or \nmitigation of the government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all \nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nApplicant is a trained and experienced industrial engineer for a defense \ncontractor who had an adverse judgment (joint and several) entered against him in 2006 \nfollowing efforts to resolve a business dispute between his venture group and the \nfinancing entity who financed his ice skating project. Unable to resolve its dispute with \nApplicant and his investment group amicably, this creditor filed suit and ultimately \nprevailed on its complaint in court.  The $75,000 joint and several judgments it obtained \nagainst Applicant and members of his venture group remained unsatisfied until recently \nand raised security concerns. \n \n7 \n \n \n\n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s accrued judgment debt warrants the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guideline: DC \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d \n \n \nHolding a security clearance involves a fiduciary relationship between the \nGovernment and the clearance holder.  Quite apart from any agreement the clearance \nholder may have signed with the Government, the nature of the clearance holder\u2019s \nduties and access to classified information necessarily impose important duties of trust \nand candor on the clearance holder that are considerably higher than those typically \nimposed on government employees and contractors involved in other lines of \ngovernment business.  See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  \n \n \nBased on his evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish \nsome extenuating circumstances associated with the circumstances surrounding his \nbusiness venture, ensuing disputes with RA over compliance with his contractual \nobligations, and the judgment that RA was ultimately able to obtain against Applicant \nand his A Group venture.  As a result, MC \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations \nguideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly),\u201d \nhas partial application to Applicant\u2019s circumstances.  \n \n \nMore important, though, in evaluating Applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility are his \nconcerted good-faith efforts to resolve his judgment debt after exhausting  all appellate \navenues available to him to reverse or remand the judgment. In his response to the \nFORM, he provided proof he satisfied the judgment with the aid of refinancing of his \nhome mortgage. Applicant\u2019s documented judgment satisfaction entitles him to \napplication of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  \n \n \n \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant\u2019s disputes with RA over compliance \nwith construction conditions in the naming rights agreement he and his venture \nmembers signed with RA were manifestly waged in good-faith.  In the end, RA prevailed \nand obtained a $75,000 judgment in 2006 that was sustained on appeal.  \n \n \nFor several years, Applicant did not have the resources to satisfy the joint and \nseveral judgment entered against him and his co-guarantors. As a consequence, \ninterest continued to accrue on the judgment at the legal rate in his state.  However, \nwith the aid of mortgage refinancing of his home, he was recently able to settle his \nportion of the judgment debt with RA and obtain a documented satisfaction of judgment. \nThis was a considerable achievement for Applicant, considering the size of the \njudgment and the limited amount of negotiating leverage he retained with the judgment \ncreditor after the judgment was finalized. Full mitigation credit is available to Applicant \nbased on his demonstrated judgment satisfaction.   \nPage 8 \n\n \nPage 9 \n \n \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding \nApplicant\u2019s business venture, ensuing litigation with RA, his ultimate resolution of his \nonly delinquency, and his overall professional and community standing, safe predictive \njudgments may be made about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his accrued debts as they \nmaterialize in the future and maintain his finances at stable levels commensurate with \nhis holding a security clearance.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the \nallegations covered by SOR subparagraph 1.a.    \n \n \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including \neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, \nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate \nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n         GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):       FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n  Subpara 1.a: \n \n \n \n \n         For Applicant \n \n    \nConclusions \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.  \nClearance is granted.  \n \n                                   \nRoger C.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February 13, 2008. The SOR is equivalent\nto an administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues\nin this case fall under Guideline H based on Applicant\u2019s illegal drug involvement\n(marijuana) and  Guideline E for personal conduct. For the reasons discussed below,\nthis case is decided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nJune 23, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on March 13, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on May 15, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 27,\n2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nAt hearing, the government moved to amend the SOR in two ways. First, it was\namended to correct a typographical error by changing SOR \u00b6 1.f to \u00b6 1.e, thereby\neliminating \u00b6 1.f (Tr. 14\u201315). Second, it was amended to conform to the evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s recent marijuana use by changing SOR \u00b6 1.a to read as follows: \u201cYou used\nmarijuana from January 2001 to March 6, 2008\u201d (Tr. 116\u2013117). Applicant had no\nobjections and the motions were granted.  \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement, the SOR, as amended, alleges: (1)\nApplicant used marijuana from January 2001 to about March 6, 2008; (2) that in a\nMarch 2007 interview he admitted that he currently used marijuana approximately five\nto seven times per week; (3) that he currently used marijuana for anxiety and planned\non continuing its use; (4) that he occasionally bought marijuana; and (5) that his\nmarijuana use took place after he was granted a security clearance in February 1992.\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct, the SOR alleges: (1) Applicant used marijuana\nafter being granted a security clearance; and (2) Applicant falsified material facts on a\nJuly 2001 security-clearance application by failing to disclose his marijuana use in\nJanuary 2001 as alleged under Guideline H.\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with reservations, the factual\nallegations under Guideline H. He averred that the January 2001 start date of his\nmarijuana use was an estimate and that he believed his use started after October 2001.\nAlso, he stated that he no longer used or purchased marijuana and did not intend to do\nso in the future. Under Guideline E, he admitted using marijuana while holding a\nsecurity clearance, but he denied the falsification allegation. Based on the record\nevidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\n\n3\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has lived and\nworked in the same community since 1988. He has worked for his current employer\nsince December 1991. He worked for another federal contractor from July 1988 to\nDecember 1991. His current position or job title is senior project scientist. He has held a\nsecurity clearance since at least 1992. He is seeking to upgrade the security clearance\nfrom secret to the top-secret level (Tr. 6). \nApplicant has been married since 1983. He and his wife have four children\nbetween the ages of 15 and 19. His educational background includes a Ph.D. in physics\nawarded in 1988. \nTo retain a security clearance, Applicant completed a security-clearance\napplication in July 2001 (Exhibit 3). In response to three questions about illegal drugs\n(Questions 27, 28, and 29), Applicant replied in the negative thereby denying any illegal\ndrug involvement.\nTo upgrade to a top-secret security clearance, Applicant completed a security-\nclearance application in December 2006 (Exhibit 1). In response to three questions\nabout illegal drugs (Questions 24a, 24b, and 24c), Applicant admitted illegal drug use\nwithin the last seven years, he admitted using illegal drugs while possessing a security\nclearance, and he denied illegal drug trafficking. In explanation, he described his drug\nuse as the occasional use of marijuana from January 2001 to December 2006. He\nstated that the from date was estimated, and that he occasionally used marijuana and\nhad for the past several years. \nHe confirmed and provided additional information about his marijuana use in his\nbackground interview of March 2007 (Exhibit 2 at 8\u201311). Among other things, he  stated\nthe following about his marijuana involvement:\n\u2022\nHe admitted that he currently used marijuana on a regular basis, about five to\nseven times per week.\n\u2022\nHe admitted that his most recent usage took place the day before the interview.\n\u2022\nHe admitted that he intended to continue using marijuana.\nSeveral months later in November 2007, Applicant replied to interrogatories\nissued to him by the government (Exhibit 2). He admitted using marijuana (\u201ccannabis\u201d)\nfive to seven times per week, he admitted using marijuana as recently as November 19,\n2007, and he stated that his intentions for future use of marijuana were unknown. In\naddition, he explained his marijuana use while possessing a security clearance as\nfollows: \nMy use of cannabis came about initially due to anxiety issues. I briefly\ninvestigated standard treatments for anxiety and they were ineffectual and\nhad undesired side effects. However, the use of cannabis resolved the\nanxiety problems I was having and did so with minimal side effects. I have\n\n4\ncontinued its use due to both its resolving of my anxiety issues and the\nlack of negative side effects (Exhibit 2 at 5). \nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant explained that he noticed he was becoming\nmore and more on edge in the early 2000s (Tr. 53). His anxiety was causing difficulties\nin his marriage and he decided to consult an physician in April 2001 (Tr. 54; Exhibit B).\nHe was prescribed a medicine, took it for a brief period, and found the negative side\neffects unacceptable as it interfered with marital relations. He was uncomfortable\ndiscussing that aspect with his doctor and therefore did not disclose the negative side\neffects. \nHis symptoms continued and became worse. Applicant had used marijuana when\nhe was a college student and thought it might help. He obtained some, used it, and\nexperienced immediate relief, characterizing it as \u201ca miracle drug\u201d (Tr. 61). He recalls\nbeginning to use marijuana in about October or November 2001, and he ties that date\nto an October 2001 visit to his doctor for a comprehensive physical examination (Tr. 98;\nExhibit B).  When he began using marijuana, he did not intend for it to be permanent,\nbut he ended up using the drug frequently, although rarely becoming impaired, for an\nextended period (Tr. 62). He used marijuana for three reasons: (1) it provided effective\nand reliable relief for his anxiety and depression; (2) he did not fully understand or\nappreciate that marijuana use was considered a serious matter by the federal\ngovernment; and (3) he became complacent (using marijuana was easier than\nchanging), and he remained concerned about the negative side effects of standard\ntreatment (Tr. 63\u201365).  \nUnder cross-examination, he acknowledged having a security clearance since at\nleast 1992 if not 1988 when he began his first job (Tr. 70). He admitted that he has\nabstained from marijuana since about March 6, 2008, which was the day he returned to\nhis doctor and reported his marijuana use as an alternative treatment (Tr. 74\u201375; Exhibit\nB). Also, he admitted continuing to use marijuana after receiving the SOR in February\n2008, and he admitted using it a few days before he filed his Answer in March 2008 (Tr.\n75). And he agreed that his description of his marijuana use as occasional\u2014in his\nDecember \n2006 \nsecurity-clearance \napplication\u2014was \n\u201csomewhat \nof \na\nmischaracterization\u201d (Tr. 88\u201389). \nHis most current usage took place in 2007 and 2008. He used marijuana during\nall of 2007, never less than once a week and at most seven times a week (Tr.\n100\u2013101). For 2008, his usage continued from January until about March 6 at a\nfrequency of about five times a week (Tr. 101\u2013102).\n   \nHe is currently under the care of his doctor who prescribed an anxiety drug and\nan antidepressant drug for Applicant (Tr. 103\u2013105; Exhibit B). The combined effect of\nthe medicines has been effective, and Applicant has obtained relief without the negative\nside effect previously experienced. He has had no desire to use marijuana since the\nend of March 2008, and he no longer has a desire to use it (Tr. 106, 113). To that end,\nin April 2008, he underwent a drug screen and the results were negative for all\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n5\nsubstances of abuse, including marijuana (Tr. 112\u2013113; Exhibit B). In addition to the\ndrug screening, Applicant submitted a signed statement, dated March 10, 2008, wherein\nhe declared an intent to never use illegal drugs of any sort in the future, and the\nstatement included a clause where he consented to automatic revocation of a security\nclearance for any violation (Exhibit G). \nProfessionally, Applicant is a well-regarded employee. A senior vice president for\nthe company verified Applicant\u2019s good employment record dating back to 1991 (Tr.\n32\u201345; Exhibit A). The vice president described Applicant as a person of integrity with\noutstanding job performance, and he has no reservations about Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness (Tr. 36\u201337). In addition, Applicant submitted four letters of character\nreference from longtime colleagues who view Applicant as a highly capable scientist as\nwell as a person of good character and trustworthiness (Exhibit E). \nOther than his marijuana use, Applicant appears to be a law-abiding citizen. He\nsubmitted a driver\u2019s license abstract to verify that he has no convictions (Exhibit F). \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n5\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 17\u201318 (setting forth the security concern as well as the disqualifying and mitigating\n14\nconditions). \n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\n1.\nThe Drug Involvement Security Concern\nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement,  the security concern is that \u201cuse of an\n14\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\n\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 17. \n17\n7\nregulations.\u201d  The definition of drug abuse is \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal\n15\ndrug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d16\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following conditions raise a\nsecurity concern:\n\u2022\nAny drug abuse (see above definition);  \n\u2022\nIllegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase,\nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and\n\u2022\nAny illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.17\nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug involvement raises security concerns because it\ncalls into question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and willingness to obey the\nlaw. Beginning in October or November 2001, he used marijuana to self-medicate his\nanxiety and depression. He obtained the marijuana by buying it, and in doing so he\nassociated himself with a drug dealer. He used marijuana, typically at his home, on a\nregular and frequent basis for several years until about March 6, 2008. His usage took\nplace while possessing a security clearance. These circumstances show that Applicant\nused grossly poor judgment for several years.  \nThe four mitigating conditions under Guideline H have been considered and none\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor. The evidence in his favor is minimal, as his use of marijuana\nis too frequent and too recent to be mitigated. Although he signed a statement of intent\nnot to abuse any drugs in the future, he did so a few days after his last use of marijuana\non about March 6, 2008. It is too soon to determine how he will progress and if his\nefforts will result in a permanent change in his behavior.  \nIn addition, I considered Applicant\u2019s motivation to use marijuana was an effort to\ntreat his conditions without the negative side effect he experienced. His desire to avoid\nthe negative side effect is completely understandable. But his chosen course of action\nwas wrongheaded and illegal. A reasonable person in the same or similar\ncircumstances would have returned to his physician and sought further assistance.\nGiven his age, education, and experience, Applicant should have taken that course of\naction in 2001 instead of in 2008.\nApplicant is now under the care of his doctor who is treating Applicant with\nsuccess using prescribed medicines. Applicant has agreed to this course of treatment\nand has abstained from using marijuana since beginning treatment on March 6, 2008.\nApplicant receives credit for doing so, but it is insufficient to mitigate the security\nconcerns. His recent corrective actions amount to the first step toward reestablishing his\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n18\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n19\n8\nrecord as a law-abiding citizen, and his actions are not a substitute for an established\ntrack record of reform and rehabilitation. In short, his actions are insufficient to\novercome several years of grossly poor judgment. Accordingly, Guideline H is decided\nagainst Applicant.    \n2.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n18\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n19\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, the issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer\nto Question 27 in his July 2001 security-clearance application. He denies that his\nnegative response to Question 27 was intentionally false because his marijuana use did\nnot begin until October or November 2001, not January 2001, as he estimated in the\n2006 security-clearance application (Exhibit 1).  \nHis contentions and explanations are credible. The time line of events\nestablishes that his drug abuse started in late 2001 as opposed to January 2001.\nIndeed, Applicant stated that the January 2001 start date was an estimate when he\nreported his drug use (Exhibit 1). In addition, the time line is generally corroborated by\nthe medical records and his wife\u2019s recollection of events (Exhibits B and E). Based on\nthe record evidence as a whole, Applicant has successfully rebutted the falsification\nallegation. \nIn addition to the falsification allegation, SOR \u00b6 2.a alleged the circumstance that\nApplicant used marijuana after being granted a security clearance. This allegation is\nredundant with and repetitive of the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. This circumstance was\nadequately covered under Guideline H\u2014indeed, a specific DC applies to this\n\n Revised Guidelines at 1\u20132. \n20\n9\ncircumstance\u2014and I gave this circumstance substantial weight. Additional discussion\nunder Guideline E would add little to the analysis, and it will make no difference in the\nultimate outcome of the case. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  \n3.\nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the Directive, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant facts and circumstances. This analysis includes nine\nadjudicative factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n20\nI considered these nine factors, as well as Applicant\u2019s good employment record\nand the circumstance that Applicant voluntarily reported his marijuana involvement\nwhen he completed his security-clearance application in 2006. He deserves credit for\ncoming forward with this adverse information. But the credit is somewhat reduced\nbecause Applicant understated or minimized his drug use when he described himself as\nan occasional user of marijuana, a description that was a mischaracterization (Tr. 88-\n89). \nA core value or principle of the industrial security clearance program is that the\ngovernment must have confidence that those people with access to classified\ninformation can be relied on to exercise good judgment. Based on the record evidence,\nApplicant remains under a cloud of doubt due to his history of marijuana involvement\nwhile possessing a security clearance, which ended a few months ago. Without an\nestablished track record of reform and rehabilitation, the record evidence is not\nsufficient to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the drug involvement security\nconcerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n10\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest  to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",
