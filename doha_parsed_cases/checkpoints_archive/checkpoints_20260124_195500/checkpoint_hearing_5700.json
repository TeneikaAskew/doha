As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan.\n2, 1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 29,\n2006. It detailed the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s answer to the\nSOR was in writing but undated. She elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The\ncase was assigned to me on February 16, 2007. With the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing\non March 21, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security\nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy an ADP I/II/III position. Department Counsel\noffered five exhibits that were marked as GE 1-5, and admitted without objections. Applicant offered\nnine exhibits that were marked as AE A-L and admitted without objections. DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 41 years old and has worked as a health-care finder for a federal contractor since\nAugust 2005. She is a high school graduate and has attended some college courses. She is married\nand has a 17 year old daughter who graduated from high school in February 2007. Her daughter lives\nat home and does not work. Applicant\u2019s husband receives social security benefits and is presently\nworking as a security guard. Applicant\u2019s daughter also receives social security benefits.\nApplicant and her family lived in State A from 1985 to 1999. She was employed in State A\nand her husband was not. Her husband decided he wanted to move to State B, so they did. Neither\nhad secured employment in State B when they moved.  They moved to City Y where Applicant\u2019s\n1\nhusband was a property manager of an apartment for two months. They did not like City Y, so they\nmoved to City X. Neither had secured employment in City X before they moved.  Applicant did not\n2\nwork from September 1999 until April 2000. It is unclear when Applicant\u2019s husband secured\nemployment, but he was not working when she quit her job in December 2003.

She stated\nwas looking for employment, but could not find a job.  \n4\nApplicant and her husband filed for bankruptcy in 1996. Approximately $60,000 in debt was\ndischarged. The reason for the bankruptcy was a failed trucking business. Applicant stated she was\na silent partner in the business.5\nSOR 1.b is a judgment from State A entered against Applicant in 1996 for unpaid taxes in\nthe amount of $1,006.52. Applicant stated she believed she paid all of her taxes before leaving State\nA and did not know what this judgment was for. She stated her accountant should have taken care\nof this matter.  She stated she contacted State A and the matter should have been taken care of.  She\n6\n7\ndid not provide any supporting documents to show she paid the taxes and the judgment has been\ncleared. \nSOR 1.c is the deficiency owed on a truck Applicant and her husband owned and was\nrepossessed. They could not make payments on the vehicle when her husband lost her job. She has\nnot contacted the creditor or made any payments on the debt.8\nSOR 1.d is an account in collection status. Applicant stated she has made payments on this\ndebt and negotiated a settlement in January 2006.  She provided AE A, which is an account\n9\nstatement from August 2005. She also provided copies of unsigned checks to reflect payments she\nmade by phone. The balance reflected on AE A is $512.98 and shows it is still in a delinquent status.\nIt is less than the original delinquent amount, but no substantive documentation was provided to\nreflect a current balance and payments.10\nSOR 1.e is a debt for a repossessed mobile home. Applicant and her husband purchased the\nhome in 2001. They could not afford the payments when Applicant\u2019s husband lost his job and she\nquit her job in December 2003. She could not recall when her husband lost his job. They have not\npaid any of this debt or contacted the creditor to resolve it.11\n\nAnswer.\n12\nTR. 57. \n13\nTr. 102.\n14\nTr.102-104.\n15\nTr. 84.\n16\nAE F.\n17\nAE F, G, H, and I.\n18\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n19\n5\nSOR 1.f is a debt on an account with a bank for nonsufficient funds. An automatic\nwithdrawal was processed on the account and Applicant did not have sufficient funds to cover the\namount. Applicant settled this account with the bank on December 11, 2006.12\nApplicant is currently making the payments on a truck she financed. She provided documents\nto show she is paying other bills, including one for elective laser eye surgery. She believes the cost\nwas approximately $600 per eye. \nIn the past Applicant was responsible for paying the family expenses, but in 2003 her\nhusband took over the responsibilities.  However, they do not pool their money to pay joint bills.\n13\nShe pays certain monthly expenses and he pays others. He does not contribute payments toward their\ndelinquent debts.  He is responsible for his money and they have not discussed how they will pay\n14\nfor joint bills. She agreed they will need to do that in the future.  Applicant has not had credit\n15\ncounseling because she stated she believed it was only available when the delinquent debts are credit\ncard bills, which she does not have.16\nApplicant provided a reference letter from her landlord to reflect that she has lived at his\napartment complex since September 2005 and has never been late in paying her rent.  Coworkers\n17\nbelieve her to be an excellent employee with a positive approach and ability to adapt to change. She\nis considered professional with an outstanding work ethic. She adheres to company policy and is\nconsidered reliable, truthful, and a hard worker. She is considered an invaluable resource.18\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations.\nDepartment of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the\nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.19\n\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n20\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n21\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n22\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n23\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n24\nRegulation Appendix 8 at 132.\n25\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n26\n6\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n20\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n21\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n22\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Appendix\n23\n8 of the Regulation sets forth adjudicative policy, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the adjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.24\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n25\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Regulation.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extend, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n26\n\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n27\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n28\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

The burden of proof is something less than a\n27\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n28\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n29\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n30\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n31\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n32\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n33\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n34\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\n\n8\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19 (a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has over $65,000 in delinquent debts that remain unpaid.\nShe has not contacted the creditors that hold her largest debts and although she stated she is\nattempting to pay others, she failed to provide documents to support her payments. She has paid one\ndelinquent debt. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20 (b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the person received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control), FC MC 20 (d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant and her husband had their debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1996. Applicant has\na tax judgment that remains unresolved. She has two large debts, both for repossessions, that she has\nnot contacted the creditors to resolve. She provided no indication of how she planned on resolving\nthe debts. I find FC MC 20 (a) does not apply. Applicant and her husband have had periods of\nunemployment, but they have also made financially risky decisions that were within their control.\nApplicant was employed when they chose to move without either of them having secured\nemployment. They moved to City Y and then moved again without having employment in City X.\nApplicant quit her job when her husband was unemployed and remained unemployed for an extended\nperiod of time. These conditions were within Applicant\u2019s control. I find FC MC 20 (b) does not apply.\nApplicant has not taken action on her large debts. She has paid one debt. There is no evidence that\nshe has received financial counseling to resolve her debts. The documents Applicant did provide do\nnot substantiate that she is paying one of her smaller debts. I find neither FC MC 20 (c) or (d) apply.\nThe Whole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. I considered Applicant\u2019s age and her work performance. I also\nconsidered that Applicant did not provide any evidence that she has made a payment or contacted the\n\n9\ncreditors to resolve her largest delinquent debts. Although she paid one debt, the others remain either\nunpaid or insufficient proof was provided to show progress in paying. Applicant had a job and quit\nit when she could not afford to do so. Because of her actions she was unemployed for a long period.\nShe and her husband have also had their debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1996 and find themselves\nin financial trouble again. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns\nraised by the financial considerations under Guideline F. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position.

She enjoys working and living in the United States.\nShe considers herself a good citizen and has no history of any legal problems.8\nThe government did not submit any information regarding France.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \"the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position ....\nthat will give that person access to such information.\"  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch.\nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the\nadjudicative process factors listed in paragraph 6.3 of the Directive and AG paragraph 2(a). \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\"whole person concept,\" all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\nThe Directive, as amended by Change 4, dated April 20, 1999, uses 'clearly consistent with the national\n9\ninterest\" (Sec. 2.3; Sec.2.5.3; Sec 3.2.; and Sec. 4.2.; Enclosure 3, Sec. E3.1.1.; Sec. E3.1.2.; Sec. E3.1.2.5.; Sec.\nE3.1.2.6.; and Sec. E3.1.2.7.), \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.3.); and\n\"clearly consistent with national security\" (Enclosure 2, Sec. E2.2.2.).\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n10\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Para E3.1.15.\n11\n5\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals's  age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the trustworthiness\neligibility is \"clearly consistent with the interests of national security\" or \"clearly consistent with the\nnational interest.\"  For the purposes herein, despite the different wording in each, I have concluded\n9\nall of the standards are the same. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that\nare reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided\ndrawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the\n10\napplicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\novercome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s eligibility.11\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. Because of this special relationship, the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to sensitive information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Any\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Para. E2.2.2\n12\n6\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of national security.12\nOne additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be, \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Trustworthiness determination\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part,\non any express or implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in\nthe SOR. \nForeign Preference\nThe government established its case under Guideline C. Applicant admits that she is in\npossession of a current French passport and exercises the right to keep her French citizenship after\nliving in the United States and holding a valid U.S. passport. She is not willing to relinquish her\nFrench citizenship. This raises a security concern, under Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition\n(FP DC) AG \u00b6 10 (a) (1) (possession of a current foreign passport).\nApplicant admits that she is in the process of registering her son for his French citizenship so\nthat he may enjoy any future educational or other benefits from France. She also hold a share in her\ngrandfather's company, but is not involved with the day to day business. This raises FP DC AG \u00b6 10\n(5) (using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country).\nWhen the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the\nburden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case. Here Applicant has expressly\ndecided to retain her dual citizenship. Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11 (b)\ndoes not apply. \nAfter a review of the other mitigating conditions, I find that none apply in this case. Applicant\nhas not mitigated the Foreign Preference trustworthiness concern.\nWhole Person \n\n7\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. As noted above, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the whole person concept. It recognizes a person be viewed by the totality of his or her\nacts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nI considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the whole-person concept.\nApplicant has been a dual citizen of France and the United States. Ordinarily, an applicant's foreign\ncitizenship possesses little significance if based solely on her birth in a foreign country. Applicant\nis proud of her U.S. citizenship, but wants to maintain  an active assertion of certain foreign\ncitizenship rights for her son.  A detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not\nrequired before the Government may deny eligibility for a position of trustworthiness under\nGuideline C. Because any doubts must be resolved in favor or national security, I find the allegations\nregarding foreign preference in the government's favor. Eligibility is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n              Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:           \n AgainstApplicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant eligibility for a position of trustworthiness to Applicant.

As\nof the date of her response to the file of relevant material, she still had five delinquent debts, owing\napproximately $10,900, which have been delinquent for years. Although she established\ncircumstances beyond her control contributing to her financial problems, her evidence is insufficient\nto show that she is in control of her finances, is not overextended, and has a track record of financial\nresponsibility.

O n\nAugust 30, 2006, the U nder Secretary of D efense (Intelligence) published a memorandum  directing\napplication of revised Adjudicative G uidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made\nunder the D irective and D epartment of Defense (D oD ) R egulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram  (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SO R was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n  GE 5 (Office of Personnel Management Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF85P), dated October 24,\n2\n2004), unless indicated otherwise, is the source for the facts in this paragraph.\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 25, 2004, Applicant submitted a questionnaire for public trust positions (SF 85P)\n(GE 5). On April 5, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na statement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations). The SOR informed Applicant that based on available information,\nDOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant her eligibility to occupy an automated data processing position (ADP)\ndesignated ADP-I/II/III to support a government contract. Her case was submitted to an\nadministrative judge for a trustworthiness determination.  \n1\nOn April 23, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR. She admitted all the SOR allegations with\nexplanations and requested a decision without a hearing. On June 22, 2007, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which was received by Applicant on July 2, 2007. She\nanswered the FORM on July 22, 2007, and submitted additional information for consideration within\nthe 30-day period. The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein as findings of facts.\nAfter a thorough review of Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, her answer to the FORM, and the\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of facts. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old customer service advocate who has worked for two government\ncontractors since July 1998.  From September 1998 to May 1999, she attended vocational school and\n2\nwas certified as an emergency medical technician and medical assistant. She is divorced (did not\nindicate the marriage/divorce dates), and he has two children, a girl age 16, and a boy age 14.\nApplicant\u2019s job history shows she was employed as an ambulance driver from February 1996\nto July 1998; senior customer service representative from July 1998 to August 2000; unemployed\nfrom August 2000 to September 2000; employed as a medical consultant from September 2000 to\nApril 2003; customer service representative from April 2003 to July 2004; and employed as a\ncustomer service advocate from July 2004 to the present. She has been working for her current\nemployer, a government contractor, since July 2004. She has had access to confidential information\nsince April 2003. There is no evidence that she mishandled or compromised classified information\n\n  GEs 8-10, respectively.\n3\n4\nwhile working for two different government contractors. Applicant has lived in the same residence\nsince July 1997. \nIn her October 2004 public trust position application, Applicant disclosed she was over 180\ndays delinquent on four debts. The subsequent background investigation addressed Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial situation and included the review of her February 2005, September 2006, and June 2007\ncredit bureau reports (CBR).  It also included the review of Applicant\u2019s February 2007 answer to\n3\nDOHA interrogatories (GE 6). \nThe SOR alleges five  delinquent/charged off accounts owing approximately $10,900. I find\nthe SOR allegations are supported by the government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions. As\nof the day she answered the FORM, Applicant\u2019 debts remained delinquent. In her April 2007 answer\nto the SOR, and in her answers to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant admitted \u00b6 1.a, but claimed\nit was paid in full in 2000. She failed, however, to provide information corroborating her claim. The\nother four debts remain delinquent as of the date she answered the FORM. \nIn her July 22, 2007 answer to the FORM, Applicant claimed she settled the debt alleged in\n\u00b6 1.b and that it would be paid on July 27, 2007; that she would be making $100 payments on the\ndebts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, beginning on July 27, 2007; and that the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.e, was\nsettled and would be paid in two installments, the first one due on July 27, 2007. She also claimed\nthat she paid another debt owing $330 (not alleged in the SOR) through a wage garnishment.\nApplicant submitted no evidence, other than her statements, to corroborate her claims. \nApplicant\u2019s February 2007 personal financial statement shows her gross monthly income plus\nchild support totaled approximately $2,700. Her monthly expenses were approximately $700, she paid\n$380 in monthly debts, and had $1,749 of unexplained deductions. That left Applicant with a monthly\nnet remainder of $121. A review of Applicant\u2019s three CBRs show that she has a history of having\nfinancial judgments filed against her, and numerous delinquent and charged off debts. Specifically,\nthe June 2007 CBR (GE 10) shows (in part) two unsatisfied judgments owing approximately $900,\nfiled in 2006 and 2007, a $24,800 voluntary repossession of a car, and a $16,400 charge off debt for\na car loan.\nApplicant claimed she developed financial problems in 2000 because of her inability to work\nfull time due to her medical problems, and the death of her daughter\u2019s father in 2006. Her evidence\nestablished mitigating circumstances that likely contributed to her financial problems, i.e., she suffers\nfrom debilitating and serious medical conditions, she is a single parent with limited child support for\nher two teenagers, and has had periods of unemployment and underemployment resulting from her\nmedical problems. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence (other than her uncorroborated statements)\nis not sufficient to explain why the alleged debts became delinquent, what efforts, if any, she has\ntaken to pay, settle, or resolve the debts; the status of her current financial situation (i.e., income,\nmonthly expenses, debts, etc.); whether she is still financially overextended; whether she has\nparticipated in financial counseling; or whether she has taken any measures to avoid future financial\nproblems.\nApplicant averred that during the last four years she has worked for two different government\ncontractors and her trustworthiness has never been questioned. She claimed to be diligent and a hard\n\n  Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination\n4\nbased upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy\nin enclosure 2 . . .\u201d\n  AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . .

She is taking care of her financial\nobligations in the best way she can under the circumstances. She considers herself to be honest and\nmorally sound.\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines (AG) which must be considered in evaluating\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. Foremost are the Disqualifying and Mitigating\nconditions under each AG applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. However, the\nguidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed\nin Section 6.3 of the Directive,  and the whole person concept.  Having considered the record\n4\n5\nevidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is the applicable relevant AG.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a trustworthiness determination is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.  The\n6\ngovernment has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its\nburden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.  The responsibility\n7\nthen shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has\na right to a public trust position, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of persuasion.8\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to\n\n  See Id; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n6\nensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will\nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.  The same standard applies in\n9\ntrustworthiness determinations.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the government\u2019s concern is that Applicant\u2019s\nfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all\nof which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18.\nIt was Applicant\u2019s responsibility to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's allegations\nagainst her. She failed to provide sufficient evidence to do so. Based on the record evidence, I\nconclude that as of July 2007, Applicant had five outstanding delinquent debts (\u00b6\u00b61.a - 1.e) owing\napproximately $10,900. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing.\nApplicant\u2019s unwillingness or inability to honor her financial obligations is evidenced by the\ndelinquent debts she has been carrying for years, and her failure to show meaningful efforts to repay\ncreditors or otherwise resolve her financial situation. Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations; apply in this case.\nApplicant was provided with a copy of the FORM in which the government strongly argued\nthat Applicant had failed to demonstrate she had resolved the debts alleged in the SOR, that she was\nfinancially solvent, that she had a track record of financial responsibility. Notwithstanding the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns, Applicant failed to provide documents to corroborate her assertions. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence raised facts that I considered as circumstances beyond her control\ncontributing to her financial problems, i.e., her medical condition, she is a single parent, and her\nperiods of unemployment and/or underemployment resulting from her medical problems.\nNotwithstanding, under the totality of the circumstances of her case, Applicant failed to provide\nsufficient information to support the applicability of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition\nAG \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHer unemployment/underemployment could be considered as a circumstance beyond her\ncontrol, however, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show that she has dealt responsibly with\nher financial obligations. Many of her debts preceded her one month period of unemployment. She\nfailed to submit corroborating information showing her periods of underemployment resulting from\nher medical conditions, and the extent to which her medical condition affected her ability to work full\n\n7\ntime. She also failed to explain the impact on her financial situation caused by the death of her\ndaughter\u2019s father in 2006.\nApplicant failed to provide sufficient information to support the applicability of any of the\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions. Her evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt\nresponsibly with her financial obligations. Applicant presented little or no evidence of meaningful\nefforts taken to resolve her debts before or after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements,\nnegotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial assistance/counseling). Furthermore, she failed to\npresent sufficient evidence to show she is not overextended or that her financial problems will not\nbe a concern in the future. Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a\nfinding that she has established a track record of financial responsibility. Applicant\u2019s available\nevidence is not sufficient to demonstrate she has taken control of her financial situation and is capable\nof overcoming her financial difficulties. On the contrary, her 2007 CBR shows she acquired and\ndefaulted two additional large debts. \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I specifically\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the FORM, her age, level of education,\nher years working for government contractors, her medical condition, her periods of\nunemployment/underemployment, that she is a single parent of two, and that there is no\nevidence that she ever mishandled or caused the compromise of classified information.\nConsidering all available information, and the whole person concept, I find Applicant has\nnot mitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive\nSection E3.1.25 are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nDECISION\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a public\ntrust position for Applicant. Eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nJuan J. Rivera\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. It is too soon to tell if she will\nresolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance is denied. \n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nFebruary 15, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it details the factual\nbasis for the action. In general, the issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations based on delinquent debts and Guideline E for personal conduct based on falsification\nof a security-clearance application.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nApplicant replied to the SOR in writing on March 21, 2007. She elected to have her case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn May 30, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by her on June 11, 2007. Applicant replied to\nthe FORM on August 14, 2007, and she submitted materials for consideration. The case was\nassigned to me on September 14, 2007.   \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nIn its FORM, the government included an FBI Identification Record concerning Applicant\n(Exhibit 6). It reports that Applicant was arrested or charged (or both) with two counts of issuing bad\nchecks in 1978. The disposition of these misdemeanors is not reported. This matter is not alleged\nin the SOR. And in its brief, government counsel did not explain why a 29-year-old bad check  case\n\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n3\n Id. \n4\n3\n(with an unknown disposition) is relevant and material to the debts in the SOR, to Applicant\u2019s ability\nto repay, or to Applicant\u2019s current overall financial situation. Accordingly, the FBI report has not\nbeen considered.\nAlso in its FORM, the government included a personal subject interview of Applicant that\nwas part of a report of investigation (ROI) prepared by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\n(Exhibit 7). The ROI indicates that the Applicant\u2019s subject interview was unsworn. The general rule\nis that a background ROI may not be received and considered by an administrative judge.  The\n3\nexception to the general rule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided\nit is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  Here, the ROI is not accompanied\n4\nby an authenticating witness (for example, perhaps by affidavit or adopted by Applicant).\nAccordingly, the ROI has not been considered.    \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $21 to $10,793 for\na total of about $23,637. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant gave deliberately false\nanswers to two questions about her financial delinquencies when completing a security-clearance\napplication in November 2005. She admits the indebtedness and denies the falsification allegations.\nIn addition, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 57-year-old technician. She has worked for her current employer since\nNovember 1996. According to her general manager/facility security officer, Applicant is a reliable\nand stable employee. She is punctual and produces high-quality work. \nApplicant has been married twice. She was first married in 1967 and then divorced in 1982.\nShe married her current husband in 1989. All her children are adults.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. It is established by the three credit reports in\nthe FORM (Exhibits 8, 9, and 10) as well as her admissions. The status of her indebtedness alleged\nin the SOR is summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013medical account in collection for\n$21; delinquent since June 2004.\nPaid in March 2007. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013medical account in collection for\n$107; delinquent since April 2004.\nPaid in March 2007.\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013charged-off account for $131.   \nPaid in March 2007.    \n\n Department of Navy v.

Resolved for\n$2,917 in 2006 or 2007.  \nIn about November 2005, Applicant signed a security-clearance application (Exhibit 3). In\ndoing so, she certified that her answers were true, complete, and correct to the best of her knowledge\nand belief and made in good faith. Also, she understood that a knowing and willful false statement\non the application could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. In response to Questions 38\nand 39 about her financial record, she answered in the negative. She did not disclose any financial\ndelinquencies called for by the questions. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n5\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n6\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n7\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n8\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n13\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n17\n5\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n10\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n11\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n12\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n13\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n15\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n16\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n17\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHer  history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n18\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n19\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n20\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n21\n Revised Guidelines at 10. \n22\n6\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n18\n19\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nThe most pertinent mitigating condition is the fourth MC  of Guideline F (the other MCs\n20\nhave been considered and none apply). It receives consideration because of Applicant\u2019s efforts to\nrepay or resolve her debts (see table). She has made good progress: (1) she paid three of the smaller\ndebts in March 2007; (2) she settled or resolved two of the larger debts in 2006\u20132007; and (3) she\nmade repayment arrangements for two debts in 2007. At present, she has about $10,000 outstanding\nin unresolved delinquent debt. \nThe credit in mitigation, however, is lessen by two factors. First, her good-faith efforts have\nlargely been a recent development undertaken in 2007. Second, she still has two sizable debts to\nresolve (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f), and one account is in a temporary hardship relief status. It is unknown\nif Applicant will be able to make payments when the account returns to its normal status. \nIn short, given her longstanding history of financial problems, it is too soon to make a\npredictive judgment about her ability to resolve the balance of her delinquent debt and then live a\nfinancially-responsible lifestyle. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her financial problems,\nwhile laudable, are insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  addresses \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment,\n21\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d  In this regard,\n22\nthe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or\noral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters\nis a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An omission of relevant\nand material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently\noverlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be\nreported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to two questions seeking information\nabout financial delinquencies. She should have revealed the debts specified in the SOR in response\nto Questions 38 and 39 of the security-clearance application. She contends she did not intentionally\nomit the information. Instead, she was unaware and did not have a credit report available to her when\nshe completed and signed the application. Her explanation is accepted as reasonable because it does\nnot appear that she had a firm grasp on her finances in 2005 when she completed the application.\nAccordingly, based on the admissible evidence, her answers to the two questions were not\ndeliberately false and Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  \n\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. She has a history of unresolved financial problems and\nit is too soon to tell if she will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Applicant did\nnot meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support\na favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

On February 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, February 20, 1960, as amended and modified,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed\nreasons why, under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September\n1, 2006, DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nrevised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the\nSOR on May 4, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on June 18, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for July 9, 2007. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on July 9, 2007 to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment Exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant did not\nsubmit any exhibits. Applicant testified in his own behalf, as reflected in the hearing transcript (Tr.)\nreceived on July 18, 2007.

Applicant does not have any knowledge about the\naccounts. He tried to call about the medical bills, but has not received any information. He also has\na judgment in the amount of $169 for propane gas.8\nIn 2000, Applicant' wife purchased a computer on a credit card. They could not continue to\npay on the account. This resulted in a charged off debt in the amount of $1,494.9\nApplicant earns approximately $1,782  net a month.   He lives  within his means and has not\n10\nacquired any new significant debt. He accepts responsibility for paying his debts. He has no credit\ncards. However, his net monthly remainder after expenses is $15.28. He recently received a raise and\nhis monthly net remainder will increase. He and his wife are now living in her grandmother's house\nand do not pay rent.  He has a car loan and he is struggling to make the last payments. \n11\nOn June 23, 2007, Applicant's mother died suddenly. He is in the process of paying funeral\nexpenses. He is the beneficiary of her life insurance policy. If there is any money left after paying\nfuneral expenses, he will pay some of the smaller debts.  \n12\nPOLICIES\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd.

Additionally, each security clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts\nand circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4) the individual's age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct, (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary, (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes. (7) the motivation for the conduct, (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a\ncase can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n13\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n15\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n16\ndecision.17\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n18\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n19\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n20\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n21\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\n\n AG \u00b6 18.\n22\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Based upon\nconsideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F of the revised AG most pertinent to the evaluation\nof the facts in this case. That guideline reads in pertinent part:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations. The Concern: Failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.22\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued eight\ndelinquent debts since 2000. He still owes approximately $25,000 in debt.  Consequently, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC), AG \u00b6 19(a), (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and FC DC, AG \u00b6 19(c), (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence\nof refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Applicant suffered with\nunemployment.  His wife has muscular dystrophy and therefore she had some medical problems.\nApplicant is the sole support for his wife and his son. His unemployment caused him to get behind\nin his bills some time ago. He attempted to save money by moving into his mother's house. However,\nhe acknowledged that he was wild in his youth and did not spend money wisely. He admits he did not\nact responsibly to pay his debts. Therefore, FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(b), (the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances) applies in part. \nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. He has no plan in place to pay his debts.\nFC MC, AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)  and FC MC, AG \u00b6 20(d)\n(the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) do\nnot apply. \nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his outstanding debts,\nbut whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable security clearance decision. Applicant acknowledged his debts at the hearing\nand his present inability to pay them. Despite his good intentions and his hope that if he receives\nmoney from his mother's life insurance policy, he still owes $25,000 in delinquent debt and has no\nfinancial plan or real ability to pay the debt. He has not contacted creditors in a consistent manner in\nan attempt to resolve the matter. \nWhole Person \n\n7\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis an earnest, young man who is supporting a wife with medical problems. His mother died very\nrecently and he has accumulated debt from when he was young. He was very candid at the hearing\nand would like to pay his debts, but to date has been unable to establish a sound financial track record.\nIn sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is high. Applicant demonstrated his willingness\nto use any inheritance money to pay some of his smaller debts, but a promise to pay in the future is\nnot sufficient to mitigate his financial condition. SOR debts remain unpaid and not resolved. After\nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the\ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to\nfinancial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Due to a business downturn starting in about 1997, followed\nby a business failure in 2002, Applicant incurred excessive indebtedness. She and her husband now\nown-and-operate a truck driving as a team for a transit company hauling munitions and other\nmaterials for the government. She is not incurring new delinquent debt, and she is otherwise living\nwithin her means. When she completed a security-clearance application in April 2004, she did not\nmake a deliberately false statement when  responding to a question about her financial delinquencies.\nEligibility for a security clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on\nJanuary 26, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual\nbasis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations and\nGuideline E for personal conduct (falsification). Applicant timely replied to the SOR and requested\na hearing. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, and they apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated January 26, 2007, which is after the effective\ndate. \nThe case was assigned to me April 4, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the\nhearing for April 23, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript May 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR allegations was mixed. She admitted all the indebtedness\nunder Guideline F. She explained that the indebtedness arose from a small business that she and her\n\n3\nhusband operated, and this indebtedness relates to business expenses and is not personal debt,\nalthough she is personally responsible for the debts. She denied the falsification allegation under\nGuideline E. She explained that she answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question about financial delinquencies\nand attached a copy of a credit report to her security-clearance application. Her admissions and\nexplanations are incorporated herein. And I make the following findings of fact. \n1.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old truck driver for a transit company engaged in defense contracting\nby hauling munitions and other materials for the government. She and her husband have been\nmarried for 38 years, and they own-and-operate a truck working as independent contractors for the\ntransit company. They have a 37-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old grandson. Applicant has\nworked as a truck driver for about 30 years, and she has a Class A commercial driver\u2019s license. She\nhas a good driving and employment record in her current job (Exhibits A, B, and C). She, along with\nher husband, began their current employment in about April 2004. Her husband was granted a\nsecurity clearance in about March 2007 (R. 52\u201353). \n2.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, and that history is verified by credit reports\nfrom 2005 and 2006 (Exhibits 4 and 5). Based on this history, the SOR sets forth ten delinquent\naccounts for about $63,000. Based on the evidence at hearing, it appears that nine accounts are at\nissue, as the debt in SOR subparagraph 1.d is redundant with the debt in SOR subparagraph 1.h. \n3.\nAs she explained in her answer, all the debts in the SOR relate to their small business. The\nsmall business was a specialized trucking company hauling auto parts for a cooperative to-and-from\nsalvage yards located in multiple states. The business started in 1991, and they operated it at a profit.\nIt grew from one truck to six trucks, and they added four employees. Starting in about 1997, the\nbusiness started to experience a downturn.  \n4.\nAfter the events of September 11, 2001, the car salvage business deteriorated. Car dealers\noffered lucrative deals to sell new cars, and the auto repair business declined because it was not cost\neffective to repair a car when you could get a great deal on a new car. Because of this decline in\nbusiness, they lost money and were unable to meet all of their financial obligations. When they\neventually closed the business in June 2002, they sold the assets for what they owed. \n5.\nWhen they closed the business, Applicant realized they owed payroll taxes. After completing\ntheir payroll, Applicant called the IRS in an attempt to arrange a repayment agreement. The result\nwas an IRS audit that concluded they owed about $20,000 in taxes. They also learned during the\naudit that their tax preparer had failed to file their tax returns. Based on the audit, the IRS filed a lien,\nand Applicant and her husband paid it off in about May 2006. Paying off the tax debt limited their\nability to repay the debts in the SOR.\n6.\nIn response to interrogatories issued by the agency, Applicant provided detailed information\nabout her efforts and actions to address the debts in the SOR (Exhibit 3). Those matters are\nincorporated herein by reference. In summary, Applicant has made a few payments on a couple of\nthe accounts, but otherwise the accounts remain delinquent. \n7.\nFor her current employment, Applicant completed and signed a security-clearance application\nin April 2004 (Exhibit 1). This application was completed by hand using a pen. When she signed the\napplication, she certified that her statements were true, complete, and correct to the best of her\n\n \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\n3\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\n4\nknowledge and were made in good faith. Also, she acknowledged that a knowing and willful false\nstatement could be punished under federal law. In response to Question 28a  about financial\n3\ndelinquencies, Applicant answered \u201cyes.\u201d In addition, she reported two credit card accounts and\nwrote the words \u201csee attached.\u201d Exhibit 1 includes a one-page attachment wherein she reported three\ndelinquent credit card accounts. \n8.\nIn addition to the 2004 security-clearance application, another application was submitted in\nMay 2005, and it appears to be the electronic version. In response to the same question about\nfinancial delinquencies, Applicant responded \u201cyes,\u201d and she reported three credit card accounts.\nAlso, this application contains a one-page attachment wherein Applicant provided more information\nabout the three accounts.\n9.\nIn her hearing testimony, Applicant elaborated on the explanation she provided about the\nfalsification allegation. With the assistance of her daughter, who worked for a finance company, they\npulled a credit report for Applicant (R. 62\u201363). This is the credit report Applicant submitted with\nher initial application (R. 107\u2013110). The 2005 credit report tends to verify this because it shows that\nthe finance company the daughter worked for did make an inquiry in December 2003, a few months\nbefore Applicant completed the initial application (Exhibit 5 at 10). Applicant then turned in the\nsecurity-clearance application along with the credit report to her employer. The attached credit report\nis not included in the initial application admitted into the record evidence.  \nPOLICIES\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n4\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n5\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n10\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n11\n5\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n6\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n7\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n8\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n10\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n11\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.\nThe Financial Considerations Security Concern\nUnder Guideline F, a concern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. Failure or\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nor unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by significant\nunpaid debts. Applicant has a well-established history of financial problems. Her derogatory\nfinancial history is a security concern because it indicates inability (not unwillingness) to satisfy\ndebts and a history of not meeting financial obligations within the meaning of Guideline F.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude she receives credit in mitigation. Each\napplicable MC is briefly summarized and discussed below.\n\n6\nThe first MC\u2014the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u2014applies. The record evidence shows that the financial\nproblems happened due to a business downturn followed by a business failure. The personal debts\nwere incurred in an effort to keep the business afloat, which is not an unusual occurrence with a\nsmall business. The financial problems are unlikely to recur because Applicant is no longer involved\nin the small business, and she and her husband are gainfully employed and otherwise financially\nstable. The financial problems do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment because they were not caused by high living, frivolous spending, deceptive or\nillegal financial practices, or personal problems (e.g., drug abuse, alcoholism, or gambling).\nThe second MC\u2014the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control\u2014applies. The record evidence shows that the financial problems happened due to\na business downturn followed by a business failure, which were circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol. Although Applicant still has indebtedness from that period, she and her husband have acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances. When the business closed in 2002, they made their last payroll\nand contacted the IRS to address the issue of payroll taxes. It was then they learned of their tax\nproblems, which resulted in a federal tax lien for $20,000. It was paid off in 2006. The repayment\nof the tax debt no doubt limited their ability to address old personal debts associated with their failed\nbusiness. Given these circumstances, Applicant has acted responsibly in dealing with the overall\nfinancial problems created by the business failure. \n2.\nThe Personal Conduct Security Concern\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E addresses issues of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations. In this regard, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material\nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security\nclearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and\nwillfully. An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 28a in her April 2004\nsecurity-clearance application. It is alleged that she listed two debts from the SOR, but that she\ndeliberately failed to list the others. Her explanation\u2014attaching a credit report to her application\nin an effort to be complete and forthcoming\u2014is credible. Moreover, her explanation is corroborated,\nin part, by Exhibit 5, because it shows that the finance company the daughter worked for did make\nan inquiry in December 2003, a few months before Applicant completed the initial application. After\nhaving had a chance to listen to and observe Applicant, I am persuaded that she made a good-faith\neffort to provide a full, frank, and truthful answer to Question 28a. Given all the facts and\ncircumstances, I conclude Applicant did not deliberately conceal or omit information about her\nfinancial delinquencies. \n3.\nThe Whole-Person Concept\nI have also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept. Applicant is a 53-year-\nold professional truck driver with 30 years\u2019 experience. Although she has not resolved the\n\n7\nindebtedness stemming from the business failure, given the surrounding facts and circumstances, I\nhave no doubts about her current suitability for a security clearance. In financial cases under\nGuideline F, it is important to remember that the point of the process is not for the government to\nact as a third-party collector requiring applicants to repay delinquent debts. Instead, the point of the\nprocess is to assess the security significance of an applicant\u2019s financial record. Here, my assessment\nof Applicant\u2019s financial record is that this appears to be a case of bad things happening to a good\nperson, as opposed to the typical case of an applicant incurring excessive credit card debt by\nshopping, frivolous spending, or otherwise living beyond their means. Applicant is a mature woman,\na wife, mother, and grandmother, and it appears she is living a responsible and law-abiding life.\nThese circumstances further mitigate the security concern stemming from her indebtedness.\nAfter weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence, I conclude that Applicant has\npresented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations\nsecurity concern. Likewise, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013j:\nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

She received a low-interest loan from her company and has paid the majority of the\ndebts. Her payment for the last seven months to a settlement service shows she is serious about\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\naddressing her past due obligations. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or extenuate the\nnegative security implications stemming from financial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\n1\nApplicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued\ndue to financial considerations security concerns.\nOn June 15, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On July 5, 2007,\nI was assigned the case. On August 14, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing held\non August 28, 2007. At the hearing, Government presented four exhibits (Gov Ex). Applicant\nsubmitted four exhibits (App Ex). The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional\ndocuments, which were received on September 11, 2007. Department Counsel having no objections,\nthe documents were admitted into evidence as App Ex E. On September 7, 2007, DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for financial considerations. Applicant admits owing ten\ndebts totaling approximately $21,700. The admission is incorporated herein as findings of fact. After\na thorough review of the entire record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old accounts payable manager who has worked for a defense\ncontractor four years, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. The owner and vice president\nof her company states Applicant is loyal, trustworthy, very dedicated, reliable, organized, utilizes\nsound judgment, and ensures the job gets done.  She is \u201ctruly an asset to our company.\u201d (App Ex A)\nApplicant\u2019s husband was in the Air Force.  She accompanied him to various locations around\nthe world which resulted in numerous periods when she was unemployed.  She was unemployed\nduring 1993 and 1994, August 2004 to January 2005, and May 2005 to March 2007, when her\nhusband was stationed in England.  She was unemployed from June 1998 to December 1999, when\nher husband was stationed in Japan.  She was also unemployed from December 2001 to March 2003\nand from June 2003 to September 2003, when she obtained her current job. In September 2003,\nApplicant\u2019s husband retired from the Air Force as an E-6 and they moved to their current location.\nIn December 2003, Applicant and her husband purchased a home for $156,000 at an interest\nrate of $5.2%.  They currently owe $147,000 on the house. (Tr. 48) At this time, both Applicant and\nher husband were working and her husband was receiving retirement pay. They incurred debts to\nfurnish the home and for other reasons. \nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s husband obtained a civilian job but was laid off after eight months due\nto illness.  In 2005, her husband\u2019s heart problems resulted in him being hospitalized for two months.\n\n3\nHer husband does not work and is not expected to work in the future.  When her husband was no\nlonger able to work, Applicant\u2019s financial problems began.  During this period her mother became\nvery ill with cancer.  Applicant\u2019s mother, father, sister, daughter-in-law, and her sister\u2019s children all\nmoved into Applicant\u2019s home. \nApplicant was able to make the mortgage payment, utilities\u2019 payment, and pay for food, but\nother obligations went unpaid. Applicant has always been current on her mortgage. (Tr. 48) In\nDecember 2006, she sought debt consolidation through a financial settlement service.  She started\nmaking payments in February 2007. (App Ex C, Tr. 43) Under their agreement, Applicant paid $436\neach month to the company.  Their fee was the first four monthly installments plus payment 18%\nof all payments thereafter.  Once the company received their fee, funds would start to accumulate.\nOnce sufficient funds have been accumulated, the company would make settlement offers to the\nvarious creditors. She has made seven payments which total more than $3,000; the company has yet\nto settlement any debt. Applicant is currently getting calls from creditors which she refers to her\nfinancial settlement service. \nApplicant self-reported her debts to the company security officer. (Tr. 84). Following a\nrefresher briefing on what employees are required to tell the security manager, Applicant came\nforward with her disclosures. Without this action, the debts would normally not have been\ndiscovered until a periodic reinvestigation which would not have occurred for another six or seven\nyears. (Tr. 84) At the time of the hearing, Applicant was unaware she could obtain a company loan\nto handle her financial obligations.\nFollowing the hearing, Applicant terminated her agreement with the settlement service.  She\nobtained a $20,000 loan at a four per cent interest rate from her company, which is to be repaid by\na $416 monthly deduction from her pay. The repayment amount is less that the $436 monthly\npayment she made to the settlement service for the last seven months. Applicant used the loan\nmoney to pay three accounts with the same department store: $1,448 (SOR 1.e), $2,362 (SOR 1.g),\nand $795 (SOR 1.c).  She settled a $2,160 debt (SOR 1.a) for $1,930. She paid the $355 credit card\ndebt (SOR 1.d). She paid $1,500 on air filtration equipment debt (SOR 1.h and 1.i).  She paid $7,148\non a military credit card not listed on the SOR.  She has spent approximately $15,500 of the $20,000\nloan on her past due debts. There is no evidence related to the $1,181 credit card debt (SOR 1.b) and\nthe $2,929 credit card debt (SOR 1.j).\nThe last debt not addressed is the $6,137 debt (SOR 1.f).  The creditor is a collection agency\nthat normally purchases past due accounts receivable for a few cents on the dollar.  The debt was\nnot one of the nine listed debts she was asked about in the February 2006 interrogatories. (Gov Ex\n2), nor does the debt appear on her credit reports in the record: March 2006 (Gov Ex 4); January\n2007 (Gov Ex 2); or March 2007 (Gov Ex 7). \nApplicant\u2019s prior vehicle was unreliable so a 2006 Buick van was recently purchased.\nApplicant has an 80-mile round-trip to work and back. (Tr. 52) The monthly payments are $571. Her\nhusband\u2019s income from military service has remained the same at $4,088, but the portion that is\ndisability income has increased. Her husband now receives $3,003 in disability pay from the\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. (App Ex D) Applicant\u2019s yearly income is $42,000. (Tr. 82)\nApplicant and her husband have monthly income of $6,541, monthly expenses of $3,283, and a\nmonthly net remainder of $1,540. (Gov Ex 2) Applicant has $153 per month going to a retirement\nplan. (Tr. 59) Applicant has not attended any financial management classes. (Tr. 62) Applicant is\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n4\ncurrent on her home mortgage payments, utility payments, and vehicle payments. She has $7,000\nin her company 401(k) retirement plan. (App Ex E) Applicant\u2019s husband is currently using his G.I.\nBill educational benefits to return to school taking basic classes. \nApplicant has learned that nothing is for certain. Her finances were good when both her and\nher husband were working and he also had his retirement pay. She never expected her husband to\nbecome ill. (Tr. 67) \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline F, financial considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\n\n5\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her\nfinances so as to meet her financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owed approximately $22,000 on ten debts.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts \u201cand 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.\u201d \nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies. The events leading the\ninability to repay her debts in a timely manner are unlikely to recur. Following her husband\u2019s\nretirement from the Air Force they moved to their present location and purchased and furnished their\nhome.  They are not likely to move again, purchase, and furnish another home.  When the debts were\nincurred both Applicant and her husband were working plus they had his retirement pay.  They have\npurchased a new van which is not likely to need replacing in the near future. Applicant\u2019s parents,\nsister, and other relatives no longer live with her. \nI find MC 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\nhas some applicability. Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s illness and loss of job were unforseen events.\nApplicant has learned nothing is for certain and she must plan accordingly. \n Applicant has demonstrated a change in her financial management. There is a clear\nindication the problem is being resolved or under control.  MC 20(c) \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d applies. MC 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, applies.\u201d  For MC 20(d) to apply there must be an\n\u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay.  A\nsystematic, concrete method of handling her debts is needed, which is present here. In February\n2007, she started making $436 monthly payments to a settlement service.  It appears the only one\n\n6\nwho profited from the $3,000 she paid was the settlement service. Even though Applicant no longer\nuses this service she made sufficient payments to the settlement service to establish she is serious\nabout addressing her past due obligations. \nAt the hearing she learned she could obtain a low interest loan from her company that could\nbe repaid from her pay.  She immediately took advantage of this, obtained a $20,000 loan, repaid\nmore than $15,000 of her debt.  Two debts totaling approximately $4,000 have not been addressed.\nI am confident Applicant will address these debts because she has addressed her other debts. \nThe final debt (SOR 1.f) does not appear on any of Applicant\u2019s credit reports and was not\nof concern when she was sent an interrogatory in February 2006.  The nature of this obligation is\ntoo speculative to say it creates a security concern. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future.  I find for Applicant as to financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 financial considerations: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

On March 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement). DOHA\u2019s action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended,\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 13, 2007 and July 11, 2007. In\nhis answer, Applicant requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nhearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October\n24, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 10.  A copy of\nthe FORM was provided to Applicant on October 29, 2007, with instructions to submit\nany additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant\nreceived the file on November 7, 2007.  He did not file any additional information within\nthe required time period.  On January 15, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a\ndecision. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct, two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline G, Alcohol\nConsumption, and three allegations under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. (Item 1.)\nApplicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for a security clearance. (Items 3 and 4.)\nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.\nApplicant is 30 years old, single, and employed as an applications engineer by a\nFederal contractor.

Although a physician had prescribed pain medication, he elected not to use it\nand to self-medicate with marijuana instead.  (Items 5 and 7; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a., 3.b., and\n3.c.)\nOn about December 11, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DUI\nof Alcohol and/or Drugs with Allegation of Willfully Refusing Police Officer\u2019s Request to\nSubmit to a Chemical Test to determine Alcohol Content, (2) Driving While Having 0.08\nPercent or More of Alcohol in Blood with Allegation of Willfully Refusing A Police\nOfficer\u2019s Request to Submit to a Chemical Test to Determine Alcohol Content, and (3)\nPossession of less than 10 ounces of marijuana.  On April 24, 2004, Applicant pled\nguilty to DUI of Alcohol and/or Drugs with Allegation of Willfully Refusing Police Officer\u2019s\nRequest to Submit to a Chemical Test to Determine Alcohol Content.  The other\ncharges were dismissed.  Applicant was sentenced to serve 180 days in custody,\nsuspended for five years, required to pay a fine of $1,760, to abstain from driving with\nany measurable amount of alcohol in his system, and to submit to any alcohol/drug test\nrequest of a police officer. He was also required to attend a three-month first conviction\nalcohol counseling program and to attend a Mothers Against Drunk Driving program.\nHis driver\u2019s license was restricted.  (Items 6, 7, 8; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 2.a.)\n\n3\nOn about June 18, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with Disorderly\nConduct; Drunk in Public.  (Item 7; SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.b. and 2.a.)\nOn about January 15, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving\nUnder the Influence (DUI) of Alcohol. He stated he was sick on or about January 15,\n2006 and had consumed NyQuil before the arrest. He was found guilty and sentenced\nto four days in jail, a fine of $2,400, and a  Mothers Against Drunk Driving session.  He\nwas also ordered by the court to attend a three-month alcohol counseling program,\nwhich he completed.  (Items 8 and 9;  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a., 2.b.)\nIn notarized responses to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant stated, in\nDecember 2006, that he drank alcohol, but not to intoxication.  He stated he intended to\ndrink alcohol in the future.  He stated he had stopped using illegal drugs. He also stated:\n\u201cI never took illegal drugs enough to affect my lifestyle.\u201d  (Item 7 at 9.)\nApplicant sought mental health counseling from a licensed clinical social worker\nfor anxiety and stress in about June 2006.  His counselor sent him to a physician for a\ndiagnosis. The physician determined that Applicant suffered from depression, and he\nprescribed an anti-depressant.  Applicant met with the physician and the counselor from\nJuly to December 2006.  In January 2007, the counselor provided a letter for the record\nin which he reported that Applicant had resolved the issues for which he sought\ntreatment.  The counselor concluded: \u201cI do not believe [Applicant] is currently suffering\nfrom any condition known by me at this time which is impairing his judgment or\nreliability.\u201d  (Items 3, 7, 8.)  Applicant\u2019s treatment did not include diagnoses for alcohol\nor drug dependence or abuse.\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant stated that in March 2007 he had voluntarily\nenrolled in an 18-month alcohol/drug counseling program that included weekly\nattendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. (Item 3, Item 4.)\nApplicant provided a copy of his performance evaluation for the review period\nbeginning in February 2006 and ending in February 2007. Applicant\u2019s supervisor\npraised his technical expertise and stated: \u201cWhen focused, [Applicant] consistently\nachieves high standards for himself and members of his team. [Applicant] is a valuable\nmember of [the company\u2019s] team.\u201d  (Item 3 at 9.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe Government\u2019s concern under the Criminal Conduct revised adjudicative\nguideline is that a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an\nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Criminal conduct also raises\ndoubts about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.  Guideline J, \u00b6 30.\nTwo conditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:\nDisqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a): a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\nand DC 31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  The record in this case\n\nDC 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  DC 31(d) reads: \u201cindividual is currently\n1\non parole or probation.\u201d \n5\nshows that Applicant was arrested in 2003, 2005, and 2006 for alcohol-related offenses.\nIn 2003, he was arrested and charged with DUI.  He received a sentence of four days in\njail and a fine of $2,400.  He was also required to attend a Mothers Against Drunk\nDriving session, and he was ordered to attend a three-month alcohol counseling\nprogram.  In 2005, he was arrested and charged with Disorderly Conduct; Drunk in\nPublic.  In December 2006, he was again arrested and charged with DUI and again\nordered to attend a three-month alcohol counseling program. Applicant\u2019s admitted\ncriminal activity raises security concerns under Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 31(a) and\n31(d)  of Guideline J.\n1\nTwo mitigating conditions under Guideline J might apply to the facts of\nApplicant\u2019s case.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under\nMitigating Condition (MC) 32(a) if he provided credible evidence to show that so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal\nactivity, however, is recent and raises concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment. He provided no credible evidence to substantiate a conclusion that the\nconduct is unlikely to recur.  Accordingly, I conclude MC 32(a) is inapplicable. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under MC 32(d) if he\nprovided evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage\nof time without  recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nApplicant failed, however, to show that  sufficient time had passed to reasonably\nconclude his criminal activity had ceased and would not be repeated in the future. While\nhe presented a good performance evaluation for the period beginning in February 2006\nand ending in February 2007, he also admitted illegal use of marijuana and during that\ntime.  Accordingly, I conclude the evidence fails to show successful rehabilitation and\nMC 32(d) does not apply.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption raises security concerns because it often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, thus raising\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  Guideline G, \u00b6 21. \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions show he was arrested three\ntimes between 2003 and 2006 and charged with alcohol-related offenses.  After his\n2003 and 2006 arrests, he was directed by the court to enroll in three-month alcohol\ncounseling programs.  He provided evidence he had completed the 2006 program, and\nhe claimed he no longer consumed alcohol to excess. He provided evidence he had\nenrolled in March 2007 in an 18-month alcohol and drug counseling program.  However,\nhe provided no credible evidence to corroborate his claim of temperate consumption of\nalcohol. \n\nDC 22(a) reads: \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, child\n2\nor spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  DC 22(c) reads: \u201chabitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \n6\nThe alcohol-related conduct alleged in the SOR and admitted by Applicant raises\nconcerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 22(a) and (DC) 22(c).   His three alcohol\n2\narrests away from work raise concerns under DC 22(a).  His admitted consumption of\nalcohol to excess and sometimes to the point of intoxication raises concerns under  DC\n22(c). \nUnder Guideline G, there are four mitigating conditions that could apply to\nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct. An applicant might mitigate disqualifying conduct\nunder Mitigating Condition (MC)  23(a) of Guideline G if he provided credible evidence\nto show that so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  An\napplicant might also mitigate disqualifying conduct under MC 23(b) by acknowledging\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provid[ing] evidence of actions taken to\novercome this problem, and. . . establish[ing] a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\nIf an applicant is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or\ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is making\nsatisfactory progress, he might be able to provide evidence of mitigation under MC 23\n(c).  Finally, MC 23(d) might apply if  the individual has successfully completed inpatient\nor outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted excessive use of alcohol resulted in three alcohol-related\narrests: in 2003, 2005, and 2006.  Thus, his disqualifying behavior was not infrequent,\nand his most recent arrest occurred approximately two years ago.  Applicant failed to\nprovide credible evidence that the conduct was not habitual, unlikely to recur, and does\nnot lead to concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nWhile he provided evidence he had completed a three-month alcohol counseling\nprogram, as ordered by the court, and he had voluntarily enrolled in an 18-month\nalcohol/drug counseling program in March 2007, he failed to provide credible evidence\nof an established pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).  Accordingly, I conclude that MC 23(a) and MC 23(b) are inapplicable.\nAdditionally, while Applicant is currently participating in an alcohol/drug counseling\nprogram, he failed to provide evidence to show he had no previous treatment for alcohol\ndependence or abuse and had no history of relapse.  While he provided evidence he\n\nSpecific examples of demonstrated intent that might apply under MC26(b) are as follows: (1) disassociation\n3\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. \n7\nhad successfully completed a court-ordered alcohol counseling program, he failed to\nprovide evidence of a demonstrated pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccord with treatment recommendations.  Additionally, he failed to show participation in\na recommended program of aftercare or to provide evidence of a favorable prognosis.\nAccordingly, I conclude MC 23(c) and MC 23(d) are inapplicable. No other MCs apply. \nGuideline H,  Drug Involvement\nAn individual\u2019s use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug raises\nquestions of reliability and trustworthiness because drug use or misuse can impair\njudgment and raise questions about the person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24.  Guideline H defines drugs as mood\nand behavior altering substances. . . . Drugs include: (1) Drugs, materials, and other\nchemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as\namended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24(a)(1)\nand \u00b6 24(a)(2).  The Guideline further defines drug abuse as the illegal use of drug or\nuse of a legal drug in an manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nGuideline H, \u00b6 24(b).\nApplicant admitted using marijuana, an illegal drug, with varying frequency, from\nabout January 2001 to about January 2004, and in 2006.  He was charged with\npossession of marijuana in 2003, and he used marijuana after being granted a security\nclearance in 2001 and after submitting his application for a security clearance in 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises security concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC)\n25(a), (DC) 25(c), and (DC) 25(g) of Guideline H.   \nSeveral Mitigating Conditions (MC) under Guideline H might be applicable to\nApplicant\u2019s case.  If the drug abuse behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then MC 26(a)\nmight apply.  If Applicant intended not to abuse drugs in the future and demonstrated\nthat intent in one of the four ways specified in the Guideline, then MC 26 (b) might\napply.   Additionally, drug abuse that is of security concern can be mitigated under MC\n3\n26(d) by satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but\nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse,\nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s marijuana abuse began in about 2001 and\ncontinued intermittently to 2006. Thus, his drug abuse is recent, and Applicant provided\nno credible evidence to corroborate his assertion that he no longer uses drugs and has\n\nApplicant provided credible evidence from his therapist that he no longer suffered from stress anxiety and\n4\ndepression.\n8\nno intent to use them in the future.  Applicant failed to provide evidence he had\n4\nsatisfactorily completed a prescribed drug treatment program.  None of the Guideline H\nMCs apply to Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish recent criminal activity,\nexcessive use of alcohol, and illegal drug involvement. While he presented a positive\nperformance evaluation for the period of 2006 and 2007, the record shows he was also\nusing marijuana during part of that time. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in 2006 occurred\nwhen he elected not to use medication prescribed by his physician and decided to self-\nmedicate with marijuana instead.  When he was sick in January 2006, he had elected to\nconsume NyQuil, which he stated led to his arrest for DUI.\nApplicant\u2019s tendency to self-medicate raises unresolved security concerns about\nhis ability to avoid illegal drugs and to use alcohol responsibly. It also raises concerns\nabout his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs is recent. Insufficient time has\npassed for him to demonstrate credible rehabilitation and resolve to avoid excessive\nuse of alcohol and avoidance of illegal drugs.  However, he is to be commended for\nvoluntarily undertaking an 18-month DUIP program, which began in March 2007 and will\nbe completed in September 2008. With the passage of time and consistent good faith\nrehabilitative efforts, he might establish in the future that he is reliable, trustworthy, and\nmerits a security clearance.  At the present time, however, Applicant has failed to\ndemonstrate that he is not a security risk.\n\n9\nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states\nthat an administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust\nconsider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d I have\nconsidered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s conduct under the\nwhole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that he has failed to demonstrate that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline H\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n____________________________\nJOAN CATON ANTHONY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nApplicant filed a reply brief which included documentary submissions not contained in the record below.  The\n1\nBoard will not consider these documents as it may not consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 2, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).

Discussion\n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to\ndetermining if they are supported by substantial record evidence\u2013such relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary\n\n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\n2\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\n3\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n4\n3\nevidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3. 1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the\nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not\nprevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo\nv. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.        \nRegarding the Judge\u2019s factual findings, Department Counsel on appeal does not assert that\nthe Judge made erroneous factual findings.  Rather, Department Counsel challenges the Judge\u2019s\nanalysis of his factual findings and the record evidence in the Judge\u2019s \u201cConclusions\u201d section.\nTherefore, Department Counsel\u2019s appeal arguments will be discussed in detail with reference to the\nJudge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions in the case: (I) the Government established its\ncase under Guideline F, as Applicant has a history of not meeting debts by failing to file and pay\ntaxes owed in excess of withheld taxes in 2000 through 2003; (ii) however, Financial Considerations\nMitigating Guidelines \u00b6 20(a),  (c),  and (d)  apply; (iii) it has been four and one half years since his\n2\n3\n4\nlast failure to file tax returns and this is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability; (iv) although Applicant did not seek financial counseling, there are clear\nindications that his tax indebtedness is being resolved and is under control; (v) he has paid over half\nof his delinquent taxes, and it appears that he should have his taxes paid in about five years; (vi)\nwhile he still has over $30,000.00 of taxes to pay, he has taken sufficient steps and initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay the IRS; (vii) this is a very close case; (viii) Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax\nreturns is irresponsible but was not done with the intent to defraud the government, as he intended\nto pay as he obtained adequate funds; (ix) the new adjudicative guidelines for Personal Conduct has\nmore limited language than the old adjudicative guidelines; (x) none of the evidence raises separate\nsecurity concerns under the Personal Conduct guideline; (xi) the government failed to establish a\ncase under Guideline E; and (xii) Applicant has had his share of problems, but his military service\ntrained him to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.     \n\n4\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29,43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\n(1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. We\nreview matters of law de novo.\nDepartment Counsel asserts on appeal that the Judge erred in applying certain Guideline F\nmitigating factors (specifically identified in a preceding paragraph).  The facts of this case are such\nthat the Board cannot say that, as a matter of law, the Judge could not apply Guideline F Mitigating\nConditions 20(a), 20(c) and 20 (d) to Applicant\u2019s benefit.  However, as argued additionally by\nDepartment Counsel on appeal, the Judge has significantly undercut the validity of his analysis of\nmatters in mitigation in this case by focusing only on the current status of the debt owed  the IRS and\nby not considering Applicant\u2019s overall debt picture.  While it is true that the outstanding debt to the\nIRS has been substantially reduced through refund intercepts and payments made by Applicant and\nhis wife, Applicant and his wife have made most of this progress by incurring new debt in the form\nof a $30,000.00 loan and $6,200 worth of credit card charges.  The record evidence clearly indicates\nthat Applicant has, in effect, done little more than transfer a large part of his outstanding IRS debt\nto new, apparently current, debts with private lenders.  Any comprehensive evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent financial status (which includes a determination of just how mitigating Applicant\u2019s partial\nsatisfaction of his IRS debt is in the context of the totality of the record evidence) must contain an\nacknowledgment of this fact along with some analysis of how it affects Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  Yet the \u201cConclusions\u201d section of the Judge\u2019s decision contains no such analysis, and\nthe Judge instead restricts his comments solely to the reduction of the IRS debt and the plan to retire\nthe debt in the future.  By failing to discuss the significance of the debts incurred to reduce the IRS\ndebt, including some evaluation of Applicant\u2019s future ability to repay the private debts in addition\nto the remaining IRS debt, the Judge ignored an important aspect of the case.  This was error.\nAdditionally, Department Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the government\nfailed to establish a case under Guideline E is error.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention is persuasive.\nThe Judge begins his analysis of the case under Guideline E by contrasting the language\nbetween the old (pre-September 1, 2006) adjudicative guidelines and the new adjudicative\nGuidelines.  The Judge asserted that the new adjudicative guidelines for Personal Conduct have more\n\n\u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n5\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\u201d\n\u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient\n6\nby itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\nThis includes but is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of\nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate of other government protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources;\u201d\nThe Judge relies on the language of Guideline F, \u00b6 19(g), which states: \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state,\n7\nor local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same;\u201d\nThe SOR allegation in question (allegation 1.a.) reads as follows: \u201cYou are indebted to the Internal Revenue\n8\nService in the amount of approximately $ 65,000, in taxes, penalties and interest for the tax years 2000,2001, 2002 and\n2003.  As of March 17, 2007, this debt had not been satisfied.\u201d\n5\nlimited language and focused on Guidelines \u00b6 16 (c)  and (d)  in support of the proposition.  The\n5\n6\nJudge went on to conclude that because Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns between 2000\nand 2003 could support a basis for disqualification under Guideline F , none of the evidence raises\n7\nseparate security concerns under Guideline E, relying on the \u201cnot sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline\u201d language in \u00b6 16 (c) and the \u201cnot explicitly covered\nunder any other guideline\u201d language in \u00b6 16(d).\nIn this instance, the mere fact that failure to file income taxes is available as a disqualifying\nfactor under Guideline F does not undercut the vitality of Guideline E as a separate avenue of inquiry\nregarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  The SOR allegation brought under Guideline F is not\nbased on Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns, as the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline E\nsuggests.  Rather, the SOR allegation under Guideline F is based explicitly on the debt owed the IRS\nand says nothing about Applicant\u2019s failure to file returns.   Indeed, the Judge concluded that the\n8\ngovernment had established its case under Guideline F by referencing three disqualifying conditions,\n\nThe others were \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19 (c) (a history of not meeting\n9\nfinancial obligations).\n6\nonly one of which was disqualifying condition \u00b6 19 (g).   The other two disqualifying conditions\n9\nwere based upon what is the gravamen of the government\u2019s concerns in a Guideline F case\u2013 failure\nto live within ones means and failure to satisfy debts and financial obligations.  Given the explicit\nlanguage of the SOR allegation in this case, and given the basic nature of the government\u2019s concerns\nunder Guideline F, the Judge had no rational basis to conclude that no separate security concerns\nwere raised by Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns as required by law.  Obviously, the\nfailure to file tax returns in an of itself, apart from any considerations of financial indebtedness, is\na matter that is appropriately addressed under Guideline E, which by its own terms deals with\nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations.\nThe Board is not convinced that the new language in Guideline E creates the limitations the\nJudge suggests, nor does the language fundamentally alter the historic scope and purpose of\nGuideline E.  In evaluating the new language in Guideline E, the Board will not read the portions\ncited by the Judge in isolation, nor will it construe or interpret provisions of the Directive in a\nmanner that renders other portions of the Directive meaningless or superfluous, nor in a manner that\nconflicts with the underlying policies and goals of the Industrial Security Clearance program. See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-11454 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-02195 at 5 (App. Bd.\nApr. 9, 2004).  Instead, the Board will construe this language with reference to the Directive as a\nwhole, the overall purposes of the Industrial Security Program, and longstanding precedents. \n \nThe list of potential disqualifying conditions under Guideline E follow \u00b6 15, which reads in\npertinent part, \u201cThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Paragraph 15 sets forth the\ncontext in which the Judge should have considered Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as set forth in the\nSOR.  Paragraph 16 then opens with:  \u201cConditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include:\u201d (emphasis added).  This language strongly undercuts the Judge\u2019s\ninterpretation that Guideline E disqualifying conditions \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are exclusive in scope and\noperate to restrict general trustworthiness and judgment assessments under Guideline E to a\nrelatively narrow range of cases.  The Judge\u2019s analysis is further undercut by the following language\nin the Directive (Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d)): \u201calthough adverse information concerning a single criterion\nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if\navailable information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility,\nor emotionally unstable behavior.\u201d  The identical language appeared in the earlier version of the\nDirective (Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.4) and therefore predates the adoption of the language that the\nJudge relied upon for his narrow interpretation, which he used to dismiss the government\u2019s case\nunder Guideline E without considering the substantive issues raised.  The quoted language clearly\ncontradicts the Judge\u2019s notion that certain behavior, even if only potentially disqualifying under\n\nThe Board notes that the Administrative Judge who decided this case is no longer employed with the Defense\n10\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals.\n7\nanother Guideline, cannot serve as an independent basis for consideration under Guideline E.  The\nperpetuation of the language in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) does two things: (1) it continues the longstanding\ntenet that specific behavior can have security significance under more than one guideline and (2) by\nfocusing on the concepts of questionable judgment and irresponsibility, it contemplates that behavior\nwill have independent security significance under Guideline E in a broad range of cases.             \nThe Judge specifically commented on Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns when\nanalyzing the case under Guideline F.  The Judge noted that: \u201cHis failure to file is irresponsible but\nwas not done with the intent to defraud the government, because he intended to pay as he obtained\nadequate funds.\u201d  While the Judge\u2019s comments could be construed as the product of an analysis of\nApplicant\u2019s judgment akin to the type of analysis that would have taken place under Guideline E,\nit is not clear from the Judge\u2019s decision that he took into consideration the full range of factors\ndescribed under Guideline E and that he engaged in such analysis independent of the financial\nconsiderations analysis in the case.  For these reasons, an analysis under Guideline E of Applicant\u2019s\nfailure to file his income tax returns is needed.\nOrder    \nDepartment Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating harmful error that warrants remand.\nPursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.33.2 of the Directive\u2019s Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board remands the\ncase to the DOHA Hearing Office with instructions to assign a Judge to issue a new decision after\ncorrecting the errors identified in this Decision, consistent with the Judge\u2019s obligations under\nDirective, Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.35 and E3.1.25.   \n10\nSigned: Michael Y.

Because the original Judge was no longer employed by DOHA, the case was remanded\nto a new Judge.  After a subsequent hearing, Administrative Judge Mark W. Harvey denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision. \nApplicant essentially contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because\nthe Judge did not give adequate weight to mitigating evidence and other favorable evidence about\nhis efforts to rectify his ongoing financial problems.  In support of his request, Applicant summarizes\nthe favorable evidence he presented below.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate conclusions are in error.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \n   \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant has a history of debt delinquencies, including\nsubstantial federal income tax arrearages.  The Judge also found that debt payments consume\napproximately half of Applicant\u2019s income, that Applicant and his wife spend consistently beyond\ntheir means, that their indebtedness is excessive, and that Applicant\u2019s negative cash flow is\nsignificant.  While Applicant was current on all of his accounts at the close of the record, the Judge\nnoted that his debt load continued to increase.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul.3, 2007).  The Board does not review a case de novo.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 14, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).1 On May 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1 (Security Clearance Application, Electronic Personnel Security \nQuestionnaire or \u201cEPSQ\u201d, dated January 14, 2004). For convenience, the security clearance application \nin this decision will be called an SF 86. Applicant stated he is \u201ccurrently arranging installment payment \nof taxes\u201d in response to Question 43. There is no allegation of falsification of the 2004 SF 86.   \n \n2GE 4 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 2, 2007). GE 4 is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nAugust 4, 2008\n\n \n \n2\n                                                     \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer dated June 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, \nand elected to have his case decided at a hearing.4 The case was assigned to Judge \nGraham on August 16, 2007. Judge Graham held a hearing on September 13, 2007.  \nAt the hearing, the Government did not present any witnesses. Applicant was the sole \nwitness on his own behalf. The Government offered three exhibits (GE 1-3; R. 9), and \nApplicant offered 18 exhibits (AE A-R). Judge Graham admitted all proffered exhibits. \nJudge Graham granted Applicant\u2019s clearance on October 31, 2007. Citations to the \ntranscript in the first hearing are \u201cTr1.\u201d  \n \nThe Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case on April 10, 2008, and it was \nassigned to me on April 22, 2008. On May 21, 2008, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held, and \non June 2, 2008, I received the hearing transcript from the remand proceeding (Tr2.). \nThere was no objection to my consideration of the transcript of the hearing from \nSeptember 13, 2007 or the exhibits from that hearing (Tr2. 11). I admitted the \ntranscript and exhibits from the first hearing (Tr2. 11-12). Applicant was the only \nwitness at the rehearing. I numbered the documents received before or after the \nremand hearing from page (pg.) 1-301, and placed them into a separate orange file. \nAs indicated, there was already an AE D from the first hearing. The documents \nreceived from Applicant on May 21, 2008, were marked AE D1, and the prior AE D \nwas changed to AE D2. See discussion of exhibits at Tr2. 13-16. Documents received \nfrom Applicant on June 9 and 28, 2008, are numbered pg. 1-141 and 142-204. \nDocuments received on August 1, 2008, are numbered pg. 289-300. Department \nCounsel did not object to my consideration of those documents and they are admitted. \nEmails between the parties are at pg. 205-258, 263-266, 281-284, and 301. I received \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s closing argument on July 10, 2008 (pg. 251, 259-262), and \nApplicant\u2019s closing argument the next day (pg. 255-256; 267-268). I closed the record \non July 11, 2008 (pg. 257).  \n \nOn July 16, 2008, I sent an email to the parties providing four documents to \nthem (pg. 269-285). I provided a draft of the factual findings and offered them an \nopportunity to submit comments concerning those facts (pg. 273-282). I also proposed \nto amend the SOR to provide additional notice to Applicant (pg. 269). I also asked him \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the Statement of Reasons (SOR) was \nissued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case \nbecause the SOR is dated after Sep. 1, 2006. \n \n4GE 4 (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, dated June 30, 2007).  \n \n\n \n \n3\nto provide additional information (pg. 269). There was no objection, and I approved the \nSOR amendment on August 2, 2008. Applicant also provided the information I \nrequested (pg. 289-300). I closed the record on August 2, 2008 (pg. 301).    \n \nAppellate Litigation \n \nThe Government appealed Judge Graham\u2019s decision.5 On April 10, 2008, the \nAppeal Board remanded the Applicant\u2019s case for a new decision \u201cwith instructions to \nassign a Judge to issue a new decision after correcting the errors identified in this \nDecision, consistent with the Judge\u2019s obligations under Directive, Additional \nProcedural Guidance, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.35 and E3.1.25.\u201d6 ISCR Case No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. \nApr. 10, 2008) at 7. \n \nThe Appeal Board discussed two errors in Judge Graham\u2019s decision: \n \nHowever, as argued additionally by Department Counsel on appeal, the \nJudge has significantly undercut the validity of his analysis of matters in \nmitigation in this case by focusing only on the current status of the \ndebt owed the IRS and by not considering Applicant\u2019s overall debt \npicture. While it is true that the outstanding debt to the IRS has been \nsubstantially reduced through refund intercepts and payments made by \nApplicant and his wife, Applicant and his wife have made most of this \nprogress by incurring new debt in the form of a $30,000 loan and $6,200 \nworth of credit card charges. The record evidence clearly indicates that \nApplicant has, in effect, done little more than transfer a large part of his \noutstanding IRS debt to new, apparently current, debts with private \n                                                     \n5The briefs filed by the parties were not part of the file provided to me. I recommend in future \ncases that briefs of the parties filed with the Appeal Board be routinely provided to the judge who \nconducted the hearing (who so request) and added to the file, as is the practice at other U.S. civil and \nmilitary courts.   \n \n6 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25. provides: \n \nThe Administrative Judge shall make a written clearance decision in a timely manner \nsetting forth pertinent findings of fact, policies, and conclusions as to the allegations in \nthe SOR, and whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for the applicant.  The applicant and Department Counsel shall each \nbe provided a copy of the clearance decision. In cases in which evidence is received \nunder items E3.1.21. and E3.1.22., above, the Administrative Judge's written clearance \ndecision may require deletions in the interest of national security. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.35. states: \n \n \nUpon remand, the case file shall be assigned to an Administrative Judge for correction of \nerror(s) in accordance with the Appeal Board's clearance decision. The assigned \nAdministrative Judge shall make a new clearance decision in the case after correcting the \nerror(s) identified by the Appeal Board. The Administrative Judge's clearance decision \nafter remand shall be provided to the parties. The clearance decision after remand may \nbe appealed pursuant to items E3.1.28. to E3.1.35., above. \n \n\n \n \n4\nlenders. Any comprehensive evaluation of Applicant\u2019s current financial \nstatus (which includes a determination of just how mitigating Applicant\u2019s \npartial satisfaction of his IRS debt is in the context of the totality of the \nrecord evidence) must contain an acknowledgment of this fact along with \nsome analysis of how it affects Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. Yet the \n\u201cConclusions\u201d section of the Judge\u2019s decision contains no such analysis, \nand the Judge instead restricts his comments solely to the reduction of \nthe IRS debt and the plan to retire the debt in the future. By failing to \ndiscuss the significance of the debts incurred to reduce the IRS \ndebt, including some evaluation of Applicant\u2019s future ability to repay the \nprivate debts in addition to the remaining IRS debt, the Judge ignored an \nimportant aspect of the case. This was error. \n \nId. at 4 (emphasis added to show errors and corrective actions required). \n \nAdditionally, Department Counsel asserts that the Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat the government failed to establish a case under Guideline E is error. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s contention is persuasive . . . . The SOR allegation \nbrought under Guideline F is not based on Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nincome tax returns, as the Judge\u2019s analysis under Guideline E suggests. \nRather, the SOR allegation under Guideline F is based explicitly on the \ndebt owed the IRS and says nothing about Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nreturns. Indeed, the Judge concluded that the government had \nestablished its case under Guideline F by referencing three disqualifying \nconditions, only one of which was disqualifying condition \u00b6 19(g). The \nother two disqualifying conditions were based upon what is the \ngravamen of the government\u2019s concerns in a Guideline F case\u2013failure to \nlive within ones means and failure to satisfy debts and financial \nobligations. Given the explicit language of the SOR allegation in this \ncase, and given the basic nature of the government\u2019s concerns under \nGuideline F, the Judge had no rational basis to conclude that no \nseparate security concerns were raised by Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nincome tax returns as required by law. Obviously, the failure to file tax \nreturns in an of itself, apart from any considerations of financial \nindebtedness, is a matter that is appropriately addressed under \nGuideline E, which by its own terms deals with conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty7 or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n*  *  * \n \nWhile the Judge\u2019s comments [in his analysis under Guideline F] could be \nconstrued as the product of an analysis of Applicant\u2019s judgment akin to \n                                                     \n7The SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified any documentation or that his failure to file his \ntax returns constituted a lack of candor or dishonesty, so the Appeal Board\u2019s commentary about \u201clack of \ncandor\u201d and \u201cdishonesty\u201d is not directed towards this particular case.   \n \n\n \n \n5\nthe type of analysis that would have taken place under Guideline E, it is \nnot clear from the Judge\u2019s decision that he took into consideration the full \nrange of factors described under Guideline E8 and that he engaged in \nsuch analysis independent of the financial considerations analysis in the \ncase. For these reasons, an analysis under Guideline E of Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file his income tax returns is needed. \n \nId. at 5-6 (internal footnotes omitted, additional footnotes added).  \n \nThe Appeal Board did not address Judge Graham\u2019s Whole Person analysis, \nwhich described Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns as irresponsible, and as \ndemonstrating lapses in judgment.9 The Appeal Board did not compare \u201cThe Concern\u201d \nunder Guideline E with \u201cThe Concern\u201d under Guideline F. Instead the Appeal Board \nfocused exclusively on the Concern under Guideline E, reading it \u201cin isolation.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-20964 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008). The Appeal Board accurately \nnotes that Guideline E emphasizes \u201cconcepts of questionable judgment and \nirresponsibility.\u201d Id. at 6. The Concern, under Guideline F states, \u201cFailure or inability to \nlive within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, \nall of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information\u201d (emphasis added). These are the same \ncharacteristics or factors that the Appeal Board wanted addressed under Guideline E. \nThe Appeal Board did not explain why the changes to Guideline E (which were \nevidently designed10 to eliminate adverse, duplicative findings under Guideline E, \n                                                     \n8 It would have been helpful if the Appeal Board had specifically indicated what \u201cfactor(s)\u201d was \nmissing from Judge Graham\u2019s analysis. \n \n9 The Appeal Board stated, \u201cthe Judge had no rational basis to conclude that no separate \nsecurity concerns were raised by Applicant\u2019s failure to file income tax returns as required by law.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 06-20964 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008). Judge Graham mentioned the potential applicability \nof AG \u00b6 16(g) and stated, \u201cApplicant has a history of not meeting debts by failing to file and pay taxes \nowed in excess of withheld taxes in 2000 through 2003, as set forth in the SOR and government \nexhibits.\u201d (Emphasis added). ISCR Case No. 06-20964 at 5 (A.J. Oct. 31, 2008).      \n \n10 As Judge Graham correctly stated: \n \nUnder Guideline \u00b6 16(c) a disqualifying condition may arise where there is \u201ccredible \nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an \nadverse determination under any other single guideline . . . \u201c Also, paragraph 16(d) \napplies where there is \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination. . . .\u201d \n(Emphasis added by Judge Graham).    \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s decision does not explain why the prohibitions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) do not \npreclude making a prejudicial determination against Applicant for his the failure to comply with federal \ntax provisions under both Guidelines E and F. Nor does it articulate a rationale for why addressing lack \nof judgment, reliability, trustworthiness and failure to abide by rules could not be sufficiently addressed \nin the whole person analysis. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) seem to prohibit alleging the Guideline F conduct \nunder the general catchall provisions of Guideline E. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cAs always, \nwhere there is no clear intention otherwise, a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a \ngeneral one, regardless of the priority of enactment.\u201d Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 442 \n\n \n \n6\n                                                                                                                                                                       \nwhen that same conduct would be more appropriately alleged under the specific \npertinent guideline) should not be applied in cases like Applicant\u2019s.   \n \nThe Government very appropriately notified Applicant that his failure to file his \ntax returns had important and potentially adverse security implications and advised \nhim with SOR \u00b6 2.a that failure to file his income taxes had security implications. There \nis nothing wrong with parallel notifications under both Guidelines E and F, recognizing \nthat almost any conduct-related disqualification under any Guideline will raise issues of \nlack of judgment and irresponsibility.  \n \nI concluded it was appropriate to amend the SOR and add the following \nsubparagraphs: \n \n1.b Applicant failed to file federal tax returns for tax years 2000 through 2003 \nuntil approximately April 2004, and \n \n1.c From about March 17, 2007, until about June 2008, Mr. Moore and his \nspouse have consistently spent beyond their means as shown by excessive \nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, and/or high debt to income ratio. \n \nI will not restate or rely on Judge Graham\u2019s findings or conclusions in the \nFindings of Fact, Analysis or the Formal Findings sections of this decision, and will \nissue an opinion de novo.11 \n \nU.S. 437, 445 (1987) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Guideline F specifically \naddresses Applicant\u2019s conduct with respect to his taxes. Whereas Guideline E does not even mention \nfailure to pay taxes or failing to file a timely tax return. Furthermore, the similarity between the mitigating \nconditions under both Guidelines strongly militates against requiring redundant analysis. It would have \nbeen better to have placed SOR \u00b6 2.a under SOR \u00b6 1.a, and numbered it SOR \u00b6 1.b because Financial \nConsiderations Guideline AG \u00b6 16(g) provides, \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d Guideline E is designed to capture that \nconduct not otherwise addressed under other guidelines, or to add an element of unreliability or \nuntrustworthiness not apparent in another guideline. I respectfully request that the Appeal Board \nreconsider their recent interpretations that separate adverse findings under Guideline E are required \nwhenever poor judgment, irresponsibility or rule violations are a security concern without regard to \nwhether that same conduct is addressed with specificity in other guidelines. Ending the practice of \nduplicative, generalized allegations under Guideline E, which are more appropriately addressed under \nthe specific guidelines that address the conduct at issue, was a significant improvement of the New \nGuidelines. This improvement provides clearer, more specific notice to Applicants and improves due \nprocess because both aggravating and mitigating conditions are specifically tailored to address the \nsituations of particular Applicants. \n \n11 The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined \nthe phrase \"de novo determination\": \n \n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent \ndetermination of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the \nsame controversy. Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. \n1, 23 [(1974)], the Court had occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that \nwas \"unfettered by any prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any \nclaim that the [agency's] determination is supported by substantial evidence.\" And, in \nUnited States v. First City National Bank, 386 U.S. 361, 368 [(1967)], this Court \n\n \n \n7\n                                                                                                                                                                       \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \nhis response to the SOR and at his hearing. His response to the SOR also provided \nmitigating information concerning the SOR allegations. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old (Tr2. 5).12 He graduated from high school in 1974, has \nattended community college from 1998 to 2004, and completed about one year \ntowards his associates degree in computer science (Tr1. 17; Tr2. 5).  He has been the \nsecurity officer for a federal contractor since September 2001. He married his high \nschool sweetheart in October 1976, and his spouse is now 49 years old (Tr2. 6). His \nchildren were born in 1974 and 1979 (Tr2. 7). He served on active duty in the Army \nfrom 1976 to 1996, retiring in the grade of Staff Sergeant (E-6) (Tr2. 6). He was an \nadministrative specialist when on active duty (Tr2. 6). He has never been fired from \nemployment, has no adverse police record, has not used illegal drugs in the last seven \nyears, and has no adverse alcohol-related incidents. He has held a security clearance \nsince 1976 (Tr. 17-19), and has held a Top Secret clearance since 2001 (Tr2. 7). In \nthe last seven years he has not had any: bankruptcies, tax liens, repossessions, wage \ngarnishments, unpaid judgments, or civil court actions. Other than his delinquent \nfederal taxes, he has not been over 180 days delinquent on any debts for the last \nseven years, and was not currently delinquent over 90 days on any debts. \n \n \nThe Army characterized Applicant\u2019s active duty service as Honorable (DD Form \n214, AE E). He served in combat zones in Somalia and Kuwait (Tr1. 19). He received \nthe following awards and commendations during his Army service: two awards of the \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, five awards of the \nArmy Commendation Medal, two awards of the Army Achievement Medal, two awards \nof the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, six awards of the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the \nSouthwest Asia Service Medal, the NCO Professional Development Ribbon, the Army \nService Ribbon, four awards of the Overseas Service Ribbon, the United Nations \nMedal, and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (DD Form 214, AE E).  \n \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant failed to file a federal income tax return for tax years 2000, 2001, \n2002, and 2003 when required. The IRS sent Applicant notices indicating he failed to \nfile his returns, and included calculations about how much he owed (Tr1. 37). He \n \nobserved that \"review de novo\" means \"that the court should make an independent \ndetermination of the issues\" and should \"not . . .  give any special weight to the [prior] \ndetermination of\" the administrative agency.  \n \n(internal footnotes omitted). \n \n12 The source for the information in this paragraph is Applicant\u2019s 2004 security clearance \napplication, unless stated otherwise (GE 1), and sometimes in addition to the cited reference.  \n\n \n \n8\n                                                     \npurchased a home in August 2001 to increase his interest deductions (Tr1. 39). He \nfiled his tax returns for 2000-2003 after April 2004 (pg. 289). He believed he was not \npermitted to file a return or an extension unless he included the funds owed (Tr2. 24). \nHe did not have the funds, but believed when he did have the funds he could file and \nsimply pay the penalties and fines (Tr2. 24). When Applicant filed his federal tax \nreturns, he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about $65,000 (Tr1. 21-23). On \nSeptember 13, 2005, he paid the IRS $7,858 (AE H; Tr1. 41-43; Tr2. 28, 31). On \nOctober 11, 2005, he paid the IRS $869 (AE H).  He now understands that he should \nfile his tax returns even if he does not have the funds to pay his taxes when filing (Tr1. \n21-22).  \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant made a compromise offer to resolve his IRS debt \n(GE 2). The offer proposes to resolve Applicant\u2019s taxes owed for 1999, 2000, 2001, \n2002 and 2003, by paying the IRS a total of $68,000, of which $48,000 was to be paid \nwithin 90 days, and $550 monthly thereafter for 36 months (GE 2). The IRS was \ninterested in cash proffered with the agreement, and subsequently Applicant submitted \nseveral other compromises (GE 5). They finally agreed to pay $36,000 as an initial \npayment (Tr1. 25).  His wife borrowed and paid the IRS $30,000 on January 9, 2007. \n(AE. B, H). They also paid the IRS $2,322 on March 12, 2007, from a tax refund, and \n$6,200 on June 19 and 20, 2007, which was charged to their credit cards (Tr1. 41-43; \nAE C).  \n \nAs of September 17, 2007, Applicant and his spouse owed the IRS $34,529 \n(tax: $12,394; penalty: $7,528 and interest: $14,608) (AE G). Under their payment \nplan, they promised to pay the IRS $550 monthly. Applicant said he planned for their \ntax debt to be paid in two to three years (Tr2. 43).13 In April 2008, the IRS applied their \n2007 tax refund of $2,159 to further reduce their federal tax debt (pg. 9). By June 9, \n2008, Applicant had paid the IRS debt for tax year 2002, and only owed $811 for tax \nyear 2003 (pg. 2, 3, 7-11). However, he still owed $21,272 for tax year 2001 and \n$7,836 for tax year 2000. Id. He was supposed to start paying at $550 per month, and \nthen increase his payments to $1,000 per month (Tr1. 24). His payment plan with the \nIRS is current (Tr2. 26). His total federal tax debt is $29,107. Id. On August 1, 2009, \nhis federal tax debt was down to $26,984 (pg. 290). \n \nApplicant and his spouse received three percent pay raises in 2005, and 2006. \nWith these three percent pay raises their gross pay would be approximately $127,000 \nin 2005 and $131,000 in 2006 (Tr1. 46). His 2007 Personnel Financial Statement \nshowed gross annual family income at about $135,000 (GE 4). Applicant and his \nspouse purchased a home in 2001 and believed their federal tax bill would be \nsubstantially lower because of interest deductions (Tr1. 22). Applicant did not file his \ntax returns because he failed to withhold sufficient funds on a monthly basis, and did \nnot retain the funds necessary to pay his taxes by April 15th following the end of tax \nyears 2000 to 2003 (Tr1. 37). Applicant did not request any extensions from the IRS \n(Tr1. 30). Although he had not received financial counseling by the time of his first \n \n13 Payment of $550 per month, results in an annual payment of $6,600.  Not including interest \nwhich continues to accrue until the taxes are paid, at $550 per month, approximately five more years will \nelapse before the tax debt is paid.    \n\n \n \n9\nhearing (Tr1. 50), he subsequently did receive financial counseling and received \nadvice to reduce his debts (pg. 268). Applicant\u2019s wife is seeking new employment, and \nApplicant is seeking a part time job to increase his income (pg. 268). Applicant\u2019s wife \nalso intends to borrow from her 401K to eliminate one high-interest debt (pg. 268).

His PFS listed savings of $2,300, stocks \n                                                     \n15 His Personal Financial Statement (PFS) (GE 3) is the source for the facts in this section.  \n \n\n \n \n16\n                                                     \nin his spouse\u2019s 401K of $34,861, and real estate valued at $568,192. It also included \npersonal property (such as jewelry) and two cars. This PFS did not include his monthly \ntax payment of $550, nor did it include the increased tax payment to $1,000 (Tr1. 47-\n48). Applicant planned to meet the deficit with decreased expenditures (such as less \neating outside their home, and lower utilities). Id.    \n \nIn 2007, Applicant received a three percent pay raise increasing his salary for a \n40 week from $6,626 to $6,825 (AE C). His annual pay in 2007 was $82,046 (AE D1 at \n16). His benefits in 2007 were valued at $21,778 for total income of $103,824 (AE D1 \nat 16).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has known him for six years.16 She has supervised him \nfor the last two years. He is a crucial employee. He is highly respected by his peers \nand supervisors. He is trustworthy, honest and loyal to the company and the United \nStates.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s overall debt situation is significantly worse now than it was \nin March 2007 because he owes approximately $11,000 more to the store because of \nhis air conditioner (Tr2. 46-47), and his other debts have apparently increased by \nabout $35,000. He is current on all accounts, which means he is paying in accordance \nwith at least the minimum payment requirements of each particular account (Tr2. 47-\n48).  On July 17, 2008, I observed in an email that Applicant\u2019s refinanced his residence \nfrom $269,000 in 2004 to $334,000 and then in July 2005 to $530,000; however, he \ndid not volunteer what he did with the resulting funds, when he provided additional \ndocumentation on August 1, 2008 (pg. 289-300).    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n \n16 Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s letter, dated September 19, 2007 is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph. \n\n \n \n17\n                                                     \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d17 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).18 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \n \n \n17 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n18 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n18\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four nine conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; . . . (c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond one's means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, \nhigh debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; . . . and (g) failure to file \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of \nthe same. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial and tax-related problems are documented with \nrespect to his failure to file his federal income tax returns on time in 2000, 2001, 2002 \nand 2003. When he signed his SF 86 on January 14, 2004, he indicated he was \n\u201ccurrently arranging installment payment of taxes.\u201d In January of 2007, he reached a \ncompromise agreement with the IRS. He agreed to pay the IRS $30,000 immediately, \nand then to make payments of $550 monthly. He admitted that the reason he did not \npay his taxes from 2000 to 2003 was due to inability. Since January 2007, he has paid \nthe IRS about $55,000 and has reduced his tax debt from about $65,000 to about \n$29,000. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c) and 19(g). \n \nApplicant and his spouse owe a mortgage of approximately $530,000 and their \nmonthly principle, interest, taxes and insurance are $4,202. Their loan, credit card, tax \nand other debts total about $130,000, and their monthly payments are about $3,200.  \nSeveral of their debts have interest rates of over 15 percent. Their adjusted gross \nincome as indicated in their tax returns in 2001 was about $97,000; in 2002 it was \nabout $106,000; in 2003 it was about $119,000; and in 2004 it was about $123,000.  \nFrom 2005 to 2007, their income went up about three percent annually, and is now \nabout $135,000. The PFS Applicant provided in March 2007 showed $1,650 in \nmonthly, non-mortgage debt payments, and a positive cash flow of $367. As of June \n2008, his monthly non-mortgage debt payments have increased by about $1,500 \nresulting in a monthly negative cash flow. His overall non-mortgage debt has \nincreased about $30,000 in the last 15 months. Debt payments consume \napproximately half of Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income. Applicant and his wife spend \n\n \n \n19\n                                                     \nconsistently beyond their means. Their indebtedness is excessive. Their negative \ncash flow is significant. And their debt-to-income ratio is high. AG \u00b6 19(e) applies. \n  \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;19 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n19In ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 22, 2008) the Appeal Board explained how \nfinancial responsibility under Guideline F can be demonstrated: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of \n\u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \npayment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nHowever, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u201c . . . \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan \n(and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be \nthe ones listed in the SOR.  \n\n \n \n20\n                                                     \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. He \nknew he owed the IRS money, and yet, year after year, from 2000 to 2003 he failed to \nfile a tax return. In January 2004, he said he was working on a compromise agreement \nwith the IRS. Yet it took three more years to actually reach a compromise agreement. \nFrom January 2007 to June 2008, he paid the IRS $55,000 in addition to his taxes for \ntax years 2006 and 2007, reducing his IRS debt from $65,000 to about $29,000.  AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(g) are somewhat mitigated with respect to his tax debt because \nof his actions for the last 15 months. However, the overall handling of his tax problem \ncontinues to \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \nWhile he belatedly expended sufficient effort to reduce security concerns with respect \nto the IRS debts, he shifted his debt problem to his spouse when she took out a \nsignature loan for $30,000 at 17.9 percent, resulting in a monthly payment of $700 with \nlimited reduction in the principal. This resolution shows questionable judgment.   \n \nApplicant did not describe any conditions beyond his control that caused his \nfinancial problems.20 AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.   \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant received financial \ncounseling. However, there are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control.\u201d There is insufficient information to establish that \nApplicant applied the knowledge obtained from financial counseling or that he showed \ngood faith21 in the resolution of his debts.  Although Applicant and his wife are current \non all of their accounts, and their creditors are satisfied with their payments, Applicant \nand his spouse continue to go further into debt. In the last 15 months, their debt load \nhas increased by about $40,000. Applicant and his spouse refinanced their residence \n \n20\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n21The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n \n21\nin 2004, increasing the mortgage from $269,000 to $334,000. Then in December \n2004, they borrowed $49,000 on their residence. In July 2005, they refinanced their \nresidence again and borrowed a total of $530,000.  They have used the equity in their \nhouse to live beyond their means. After July 2005, they used credit cards and \nsignature loans to continue to live beyond their means. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable.  Applicant has not disputed the SOR debt to the \nIRS.  He agreed he was responsible for the IRS debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant did not establish he acted responsibly, prudently and in good \nfaith. He failed to show a \u201cmeaningful track record . . . of actual debt reduction through \npayment of debts.\u201d See n. 20, supra. He received financial counseling; however, he \nfailed to arrange payment plans that would result in reduction of the amount of his \ndebts. He lacks sufficient income remaining after making the minimum payments to \neffectively reduce his overall debts. His conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He should have been more \ndiligent and made greater efforts to reduce his indebtedness and curtail his spending, \nespecially after receipt of the SOR. At his first hearing he promised to reduce \nexpenses, and use the extra funds to reduce his debts. There are not clear indications \nhis financial problems are being resolved or are under control. He did not establish \nthat he made a good faith effort to reduce the amount of his debts. He did not show \nsufficient conditions beyond his control to mitigate security concerns. His financial \nproblems are continuing and likely to recur. He has not carried his burden of proving \nhis financial responsibility. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, \nI conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n\n \n \n22\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable \nbehavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary \ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other \ngovernment protected information; (2) disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior in the workplace; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) do not apply because Applicant is not accused of \nfalsifying any information provided to the government in connection with his security \nclearance, or employment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e), 16(f) and 16(g) do not apply because:  (1) \nApplicant did not commit misconduct outside the United States; (2) security officials \nare aware of his financial and tax problems, and his problems are not so significant as \nto seriously and adversely affect his reputation or community standing; (3) he did not \n\n \n \n23\n                                                     \nviolate any commitments to his employer; and (4) he does not associate with persons \ninvolved in criminal activity.  \n \nThe Appeal Board may have determined that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and/or 16(d) applies \nwhen an Applicant willfully fails to file their tax return stating:  \n \nObviously, the failure to file tax returns in an of itself, apart from any \nconsiderations of financial indebtedness, is a matter that is appropriately \naddressed under Guideline E, which by its own terms deals with conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.22 \n \nHowever, applying AG \u00b6 16(c) to address the security concerns related to his \nfailure to file tax returns appears inconsistent with the limiting language in AG \u00b6 16(c), \nwhich indicates there must be \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative \nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline\u201d (emphasis added). AG \u00b6 16(d) contains a similar limitation stating, \u201ccredible \nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may \nnot be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination\u201d (emphasis added). Clearly an \nunexcused failure to file one\u2019s tax return from 2000 to 2003 specifically implicates \nGuidelines F and J.23 Because such conduct is specifically covered under other \nguidelines and is sufficient to result in an adverse determination, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) should not be applied as disqualifying conditions.     \n \nNevertheless, the law requires me to comply with Appeal Board precedent. \nFailure to file a tax return violates a statute, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, which is a type of rule.  \nSee n. 23, supra. He failed to file his taxes on multiple occasions, resulting in multiple \nrule violations. Based on the remand order, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3) apply \n \n22 I recognize that the Appeal Board was in a quandary because SOR \u00b6 2.a was alleged under \nGuideline E instead of Guideline F. However, instead of distinguishing or limiting the restrictive \nlanguage in Guideline E, and encouraging duplicative application of adverse findings against Applicants, \nI respectfully suggest that the Appeal Board could have reminded judges that issues of willful failure to \nfile tax returns raise concerns about questionable judgment, and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations that must be addressed under the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(d) provides, \u201cAlthough \nadverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, \nthe individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally unstable behavior.\u201d The Whole Person concept \nencompasses a review and application of AG \u00b6 2(d)\u2019s criteria without resort to AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d).  \n \n   \n23 Guideline J addresses the security implications of criminal conduct. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 \nprovides:  \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this \ntitle or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or \nsupply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such \nreturn, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by \nlaw or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $ 25,000 ($ \n100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, \ntogether with the costs of prosecution. \n\n \n \n24\nwith respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a because Applicant willfully failed to file four tax returns and \nfailed to pay his federal income taxes on time.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 fully apply. Applicant did not falsify \nany documentation, nor did he refuse to cooperate with an investigation or inquiry. See \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b). He was vulnerable to exploitation or duress due to his tax and \nfinancial problems because he admitted these problems to security personnel. See AG \n\u00b6 17(e). He admitted he did not file his tax returns for 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 until \n2004 and the information about failing to file his tax returns is substantiated. See AG \u00b6 \n17(f). He did not associate with persons involved in criminal activity. See AG \u00b6 17(g).  \n \nMitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) partially apply. Applicant \nacknowledged that he failed to file his 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax returns until \naround April 2004. He receives credit for admitting his misconduct. Moreover, the \n\n \n \n25\noffenses ended over four years ago, and his misdemeanors are not particularly recent. \nThe commission of the tax offenses occurred under unique conditions that are unlikely \nto recur. Applicant knows that eventually the IRS will determine the taxes based on \nemployer-filed W2s. The IRS will unilaterally complete the taxpayer\u2019s return and \npursue additional taxes and penalties. Failure to comply with federal tax requirements \nresults in heavy civil penalties, and there are potential criminal penalties. Clearly \nfederal tax responsibilities have priority over other debts. His statement that he \nunderstands that even if he does not have the funds to pay his taxes, he should still \nfile a tax return convinces me that in the future he will file his tax return when required. \nKnowing the probable consequences of repeating his poor tax decisions, Applicant will \ntimely file accurate tax returns in the future. Underpayment of taxes is unlikely to recur. \nHowever, the conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a cannot be considered piecemeal. The Judge is \nrequired to evaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable \nconclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, \n2004)). His misconduct must be considered in connection with his failure to obtain a \nrepayment agreement until January 2007, and the failure to fully pay the IRS. He \nreceived financial counseling, and this counseling will help him gain financial stability. \nAfter consideration of all the circumstances in this case, there is insufficient mitigation \nto eliminate security concerns resulting from his personal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a. The \nmisconduct continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nEventually Applicant signed an agreement with the IRS and began to pay his \n$65,000 tax debt. He paid about half of his IRS debt using a signature loan that his \nspouse obtained. His recognition of his misconduct and promise to file and pay his \ntaxes as he is legally required to do weighs in his favor. His misconduct ended in April \n\n \n \n26\n                                                     \n2004, and he has not violated the tax law or any other criminal or civil laws since then.  \nHe is a law-abiding person as shown by his lack of a criminal record. He does not \nabuse alcohol or use illegal drugs. He provided evidence of remorse, or regret \nconcerning his misconduct. He was embarrassed by his misconduct, and he \nrecognized the damage his misconduct will cause his reputation. All of his debts are in \ncurrent status, and he has received financial counseling. He has been married since \n1976 to the same spouse. He raised two children into adulthood. His record of good \nemployment weighs in his favor. He served his country on active duty in the Army for \n20 years. He earned awards and honors for his military service. His service in a \ncombat zone is especially noteworthy. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His  \ndecisions not to file his tax returns in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 on time were \nknowledgeable and voluntary. This misconduct was aggravated when he failed to \naggressively seek a resolution until January 2007. Because there are multiple \nviolations of the law, his misconduct is not isolated. He was sufficiently mature to be \nfully responsible for his conduct. Criminal misbehavior is not prudent or responsible. \nHis failure to pay taxes at the same time that he was receiving the benefit of others\u2019 \ntaxes through receipt of military retirement pay, VA disability pay, and government \ncontractor pay aggravates his impropriety, and weighs against granting or continuing \nhis security clearance. Applicant and his spouse consistently spend beyond their \nincome, and have excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, and a high \ndebt-to-income ratio. Even after receiving the SOR, and promising at his first hearing \nto restrain his spending, he has not demonstrated that he has done so. I have \npersistent and serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s poor judgment with respect to his willful failure to file tax returns and \nhis high debt to income ratio raise serious concerns about his willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations and his future financial stability. His misconduct calls into \nquestion his current ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct.24     \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d25 \nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n24 Even if I had found \u201cFor Applicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a because the conduct could have \nbeen alleged more appropriately under Guideline F, or because it duplicates the conduct alleged under \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, I still would have found against Applicant under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, as well as under the \nwhole person concept. \n  \n25See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n27\nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

He was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)(China) in 1946. His father served in the Nationalist Army under General Chiang Kai-shek and fought against the Japanese during World War II and later against the Communists in China after the War.

TUIDER \n \n \nAPPEARANCES \n \nFOR GOVERNMENT \nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant is 61 years old, was born in China, and moved to Taiwan while an infant with \nhis parents. After completing college in Taiwan, he immigrated to the U.S. in 1970, and became a \nU.S. citizen in 1985. He holds a senior position with a defense contractor with whom he has been \nemployed since 1993. He has continuously held a secret clearance since 1994. Foreign influence \nconcerns were raised primarily as a result of having an elderly father, who is a resident citizen of \nTaiwan. After analyzing all of the facts and considering the whole person, Applicant has mitigated \nthe foreign influence concerns raised. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n1\n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn January 29, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86).1 On \nDecember 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2\n \n The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on January 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, \nand elected to have his case decided at a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2007. \nOn March 20, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on April \n19, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  The Government offered two documents, which \nwere admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. The Applicant offered 12 \nexhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 12. I held \nthe record open to afford Applicant additional opportunity to submit additional material.  \nApplicant timely submitted two additional documents, which were admitted without objection as \nAE 13 and 14. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 30, 2007. \n \nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibits (Exs.) I \nthrough XII. Without objection from Applicant, I took administrative notice of the documents \noffered by Department Counsel, which primarily pertained to Taiwan. (Tr. 10-12).  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. \n02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nThe most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are \neither well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n                                                          \n1GE 1.(Security Clearance Application is dated January 29, 2004, on the signature page). For convenience, \nthe security clearance application in this decision will be called an SF 86.    \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing \napplication of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, \nas amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n3\n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts \npertaining to Taiwan were derived from Exs. I through XII as indicated under subheading \n\u201cTaiwan\u201d of this decision. \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)(China) \nin 1946.  His father served in the Nationalist Army under General Chiang Kai-shek and fought \nagainst the Japanese during World War II and later against the Communists in China after the \nWar.  As the Communists made military gains in China, Applicant\u2019s parents with Applicant fled \nfrom China to Taiwan in 1948.  Applicant was raised in Taiwan.  He attended college in Taiwan \nfrom June 1965 to May 1969, and was awarded a bachelor of science degree majoring in \nmechanical engineering.   He immigrated to the U.S. in 1970 on a student visa and attended a \nU.S. university from June 1970 to August 1971, and was awarded a master\u2019s degree in aerospace \nand mechanical engineering. \n \nShortly after completing his master\u2019s degree, he worked in Canada from 1972 to 1979. \nAE 14. In 1979, he returned to the U.S., was granted permanent residence status (green card), \nand became a U.S. naturalized citizen in June 1985. At the date of hearing, his most recent U.S. \npassport was issued to him in April 1995. He has remained continuously in the U.S. since he \nreturned from Canada in 1979. \n \nApplicant continued his graduate education after returning to the U.S. He attended a \nprestigious university from September 1985 to March 1989, and was awarded a Certificate of \nSpecial Studies in Administration and Management. He also attended a university from \nSeptember 1994 to July 1997, and was awarded a master\u2019s degree in computer engineering. \n \nApplicant was married to his Chinese-born wife from November 1972 to January 2001.  \nShe, like him, grew up in Taiwan. That marriage ended by divorce.  During their marriage, two \nchildren were born while they lived in Canada, a son in 1977, and a daughter in 1978. Applicant \nlater reconciled with his ex-wife and they remarried in August 2005. Applicant\u2019s wife and two \nchildren became naturalized U.S. citizens in June 1985.  His two adult children graduated from \ncollege, live in the U.S., and are embarked on successful careers. His daughter is a high school \ncounselor and his son works in the information technology field. Tr. 95. \n \nApplicant holds a senior position for a defense contractor, and has been employed by that \ndefense contractor since August 1993.  His direct supervisor stated, \u201c[Applicant] is responsible \nfor development of military systems vital to our national security and our current global war on \nterrorism.  His leadership, management and technical skills are critical to Department of Defense \nmissions and directly support U.S. interests.\u201d AE 6.  Applicant has successfully held a secret \nsecurity clearance since January 1994, and submitted an application for a periodic reinvestigation \nand top secret upgrade in October 2004 at the request of his employer. Applicant has never had a \nreported security violation during the thirteen years he held a secret clearance. Tr. 69-71, AE 3. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. states, \u201cYour father is a citizen of China and resident of Taiwan.\u201d Applicant \npresented evidence correcting his father\u2019s citizenship, which is Taiwan versus China. Tr. 16, 27-\n34, AE 1, AE 2, AE 12. After Applicant\u2019s family moved to Taiwan in 1948, his father had \ninfrequent contact with Applicant as a result of job-related absences from the family. Applicant\u2019s \nfather is 86 years old and in \u201cfair\u201d health. Tr. 76.  Shortly after arriving in Taiwan, Applicant\u2019s \nfather worked for a company founded by a well-known U.S. Army Corps Aviator. Tr. 76-77. He \nworked in the aviation industry for most of his adult life and retired in 1986 and enjoys a quiet \nlife in Taiwan. Applicant telephones his father approximately \u201ctwo times\u201d a month. Tr. 75. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father stated in a letter, \u201cI am of no value to any government entity and it is \nextremely unlikely that I could be used to place my son (Applicant) in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of any foreign government or group and the interests of the United \nStates of America. Even if this remote possibility occurs and my life is threatened, I trust my son \ncan still be expected to resolve any conflict of interests and choose in favor of the interests of the \nUnited States.\u201d AE 1.  Applicant visited his father in June 1996 and January 2004, the last visit \nbeing an attempt to convince him to move to the U.S. His father declined to move to the U.S. \nbecause he thought he \u201cwas too old to move.\u201d Tr. 36-39, AE 3. SOR \u00b6 1.a. and 1.c. Other than \nhis father, Applicant has no immediate family members living in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s mother is \n85 years old and lives in a nursing home in the U.S. Tr. 80.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws in Taiwan consist of a 68-year-old brother-in-law, and two sisters-in-\nlaw, ages 61 and 55.

That same year, \nCommunists in mainland China established the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and a \nseparate, independent government was established in Taiwan. The PRC does not recognize \nTaiwan, and insists there is only \u201cone China.\u201d \n \nTaiwan is a multi-part democracy. Through nearly five decades of hard work and sound \neconomic management, Taiwan has transformed itself from an underdeveloped, agricultural \nisland to a economic power that is a leading producer of high-technology goods. \n \nOn January 1, 1979, the U.S. formally recognized the PRC as the sole legal government \nof China. The U.S. also announced that it would maintain cultural, commercial, and other \nunofficial relations with people on Taiwan. The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) signed into law on \nApril 10, 1979, created the legal authority for the conduct of unofficial relations with Taiwan. \nThe American Institute in Taiwan, a private nonprofit corporation with offices in Taiwan, is \nauthorized to issue visas, accept passport applications, and provide assistance to U.S. citizens in \nTaiwan. A counterpart organization was established by Taiwan. It has multiple offices in the \nU.S. \n \nMaintaining strong, unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal. The U.S. does \nnot support Taiwan independence, but it does support Taiwan\u2019s membership in appropriate \ninternational organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), which it accessed in \n2002, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and the Asian Development Bank. In \naddition, the U.S. supports appropriate opportunities for Taiwan\u2019s voice to be heard in \norganizations where its membership is not possible. \n \n \n3 The contents of the Taiwan section are from Exs. I through XII. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\nThe TRA enshrines the U.S. commitment to assisting Taiwan maintain its defensive \ncapability. The U.S. continues to sell appropriate defensive military equipment to Taiwan, in \naccordance with the TRA. President Bush publicly stated in 2001 that the United States would do \n\u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help Taiwan\u2019s defense and approved a substantial sale of U.S. weapons to \nTaiwan, including destroyers, anti-submarine aircraft, and diesel submarines. The White House \nalso was more accommodating to visits from Taiwan\u2019s officials than previous U.S. \nAdministrations, and permitted visits from Taiwan\u2019s president in 2001 and 2003, and Taiwan\u2019s \nvice president and defense minister in 2002. \n \nSince then, there have been changes in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Taiwan\u2019s new president \ndisavowed key concepts long embraced by the opposing party \u2013 the \u201cstatus quo\u201d that there is \nonly one China and Taiwan is part of it \u2013 and instead has adopted the more provocative position \nthat Taiwan already \u201cis an independent, sovereign country,\u201d a \u201cstatus quo\u201d he promises to \nmaintain. There was also a series of recent corruption scandals. \n \nIn response to Taiwan\u2019s political developments, the Administration appears to have \ndialed back its earlier enthusiasm for supporting Taiwan\u2019s initiatives. While still pursuing a close \nrelationship with Taiwan, U.S. officials now appear to be balancing criticisms of the PRC \nmilitary buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic cautions and warnings to the effect that U.S. \nsupport for Taiwan is not unconditional, but has limits.  \n \nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over a billion \npeople and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government, \ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party. China has a poor record with respect to human \nrights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced \nconfessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. \n \nBoth China and Taiwan are known to be active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence. \nThe PRC also maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan.  \n \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an administrative \njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to \nClassified Information\u201d (Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified or sensitive information. \n \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative \njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole \nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n7\n                                                          \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the \nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final \ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information will be resolved in \nfavor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access \nto classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is because of this special \nrelationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those \nindividuals to whom it grants access to such information. Decisions under this Directive include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail \nto protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree \nof legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \n \n4 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the \npossibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from \nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, \nevaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] \nwhether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 \n(App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n8\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express \nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order \n10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate \nlegal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the \nfollowing with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n  \nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she] may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \nthat is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain \nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \n \nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that \ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information; \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent contacts with his father, who is a resident \ncitizen of Taiwan.  He has infrequent or no contact with his in-laws. This close relationship with \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n9\nhis father creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because Taiwan \nhas an active collection program.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions as \nit pertains to Applicant\u2019s father, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the Government. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n \nGuidelines \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) through 8(c) apply to his relationships with his in-laws. His contacts \nwith his brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law are clearly casual, and infrequent. These very \nlimited and infrequent contacts are not a security concern because it is unlikely Applicant will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between his-in laws and the interests of the United \nStates.  \n  \nAppellant, however, did not establish Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) or 8(c) in regard to his father.  He \ndid not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of [his father] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d His frequent contacts with his father could \npotentially force him to choose between the United States and Taiwan. He did not meet his \nburden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with his father] could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a sufficient \nrelationship and loyalty to the U.S., as he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He has continuously lived in the United States since 1979. He became \na U.S. citizen in 1985. His wife and two children also became U.S. citizens in 1985. He received \ntwo graduate degrees in U.S. colleges and universities. His mother lives in a nursing home in the \nU.S. Her contacts and linkage to the United States are far greater than his linkage to Taiwan. He \nis heavily vested in the U.S., financially and emotionally. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n10\n                                                          \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed \npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person \nconcept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge \nmust not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. \nRather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d6 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors \n(APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth \nAPF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the \nmost relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.7 In addition to the eighth APF, other \n\u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance \ndecision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s \npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant has lived in the United States for 28 years, and he has been a naturalized citizen for 22 \nyears. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States. His wife and two \nchildren are also U.S. naturalized citizens. His ties to the United States are stronger than his ties \nto his father in Taiwan. He has no financial ties to Taiwan in contrast to his U.S. financial ties \nwhich consist of gross assets worth $5.2 million. There is no evidence he has ever taken any \naction which could cause potential harm to the United States. In fact, and most notably, he has \nsuccessfully held a security clearance for 13 years.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer\u2019s confidence and trust in him is so high as to warrant \nrecommending him for a top secret clearance. Applicant takes his loyalty to the United States \nvery seriously, and he has worked diligently for a defense contractor for 14 years. His \nsupervisors, co-workers, family, and friends assess him as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, \nresponsible, mature, and of high integrity. He has an excellent reputation as a friend, family \nmember, employee and U.S. citizen. His witnesses and documentary evidence recommend him \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On April 20, 2007, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed because (a)\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions are inconsistent and contain errors,  and (b) the Judge misapplied the\n1\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s argument persuasive.\nIn support of his argument, Applicant offers new evidence in the form of additional\nexplanations about his circumstances which address a number of concerns noted by the Judge in her\ndecision.  The Board may not consider this new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Its\nsubmission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-00184\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2007).\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nWe have considered the challenged material findings in light of the record and conclude that\nthey are based on substantial evidence.  To the extent that there is error in the Judge\u2019s findings, we\nconclude that it is harmless.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s\nmaterial findings with respect to his circumstances of security concern do not reflect a reasonable\nor plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the\nJudge\u2019s material findings of security concern are sustainable. \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person\nfactors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a\ncase.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record\nevidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the\npresence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance\n\n3\ndecision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant elected to have his case decided upon the written record\u2014a circumstance which\ndeprived the Judge of an opportunity to question the Applicant about her concerns and evaluate his\ncredibility in the context of a hearing.  In response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material\n(FORM), Applicant did not submit any documentary exhibits or witness statements, other than his\nown statement.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in\nconcluding that the Guideline B allegations had not been mitigated\u2014given the record in this case.\nAlthough Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s decision, he has not established that it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn her decision, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating factors.  She reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented\nin mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17714 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable clearance decision is sustainable.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

He has held a secret-level security clearance since March 1997 for\nhis duties as a principal engineer for a defense contractor. Undue foreign influence concerns exist\nbecause his close family members are resident citizens of Taiwan and his spouse is a part owner of\na condominium in Taiwan. Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E2.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992) as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 30, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn December 20, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision based on\nthe written record without a hearing. The government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\non February 20, 2007, consisting of four items (Items 1-4) and 11 documents for administrative\nnotice that were not marked, but were identified in the FORM as I through XI. Through undated\ncorrespondence signed by Department Counsel on February 20, 2007, DOHA forwarded a copy of\nthe FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant filed a\ntimely rebuttal dated March 11, 2007. On review, Department Counsel had no objections to\nApplicant\u2019s submission. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007, to determine whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nIn the FORM, the government requested the administrative judge take administrative notice\nof several facts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC or China):\n\u2022\nTaiwan was populated in 1949 by refugees fleeing a civil war in China and a government\nindependent from China was established in Taiwan.\n\u2022\nIn 1949, the Communists in mainland China established the PRC.\n\u2022\nThe PRC does not recognize Taiwanese independence and insists there is only one China.\n\u2022\nSince January 1, 1979, the United States has recognized the government of the PRC as the\nsole legal government of China (\u201cone China policy\u201d) and does not support independence for\nTaiwan.\n\u2022\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy that retains close ties to China and it has developed a\nstrong economy.\n\u2022\nTaiwan\u2019s national security remains under constant threat from the PRC and this has led to\nTaiwan\u2019s large military establishment.\n\u2022\nThe PRC and Taiwan are known to be active collectors of U.S. economic intelligence with\nboth reported in 2000 to be among the most active collectors of U.S. economic and\nproprietary information.\n\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2006 (I), Consular Information Sheet: Taiwan, dated August\n1\n30, 2006 (III); Background Note: China, dated April 2006 (VIII), China: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-\n2005, dated March 8, 2006 (IX).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n2\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (IV). The document was prepared for the\n3\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (VI) and\n4\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (XI).\nSee U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\n5\ndeclassified version dated May 25, 1999 (X).\n4\n\u2022\nTaiwan\u2019s collection activities are ongoing, as evidenced by the January 2006 conviction of\na U.S. citizen on charges related to the theft of sensitive and proprietary information by and\nfor Taiwan companies, and a U.S. State Department official\u2019s September 2004 guilty plea\nto illegally removing classified material and making false statements to the U.S. government\nconcerning his passing documents to an agent of Taiwan\u2019s foreign intelligence agency.\n\u2022\nThe PRC has an authoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\u2022\nThe PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its\npractices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment\nof prisoners.\n\u2022\nChina possesses large and increasing sophisticated military forces (naval and air forces),\nincluding strategic nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\u2022\nChina aggressively targets sensitive and protected U.S. technologies. Americans of Chinese\nancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by the PRC.\n\u2022\nThe PRC\u2019s Ministry of State Security, the preeminent civilian intelligence collection agency\nin China, is focused primarily on conducting intelligence activities against and in Taiwan.\nThe government relied on source documents from the Department of State;  the\n1\nCongressional Research Service;  the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies;  the\n2\n3\nNational Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive;  and a Select Committee of the United States House of Representatives.  For proof that\n4\n5\nTaiwan was continuing its collection activities against the U.S., the government relied on an April\n2006 press release from the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York (VII) and pleadings\nfiled with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (V). \n \nAuthority to consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery,\nand evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner.).  The DOHA\nAppeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader\nthan judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No. 02-24875 (decided Oct.\n\nEven if a fact about the PRC is proper for administrative notice, its relevance is limited where there are no\n6\nallegations in the SOR involving the PRC.\n5\n12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error in a DOHA administrative judge taking administrative\nnotice of a U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights 2000: Laos, as the document\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was\nprovided in advance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present\nalternative information for the judge to notice.\nApplicant herein had the opportunity to review the source documents provided and filed no\nobjections. Official publications of U.S. executive branch and legislative branch entities clearly may\nbe considered, although the relevance of the unclassified excerpts from a bipartisan Select\nCommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Annual Report to Congress for 2000 is\nprimarily historical given the dated nature of these documents (VI and X). The Intelligence Threat\nHandbook (IV) is distinguishable as a product of a private contractor at the behest of the\nInteragency/OPSEC Support Staff. Administrative notice may be taken of non governmental\nissuances, and will be accepted of this document given the absence of any objection from Applicant.\nThe district court pleading is accepted for what it is, i.e., allegations, not proof of misconduct. The\npress release is hearsay entitled to little or no weight.\nWhile the source documents may properly be considered, the government has requested\nnotice of proposed facts that may or may not be supported by the documentation. After review of the\nsource documents, I agree to take administrative notice of the facts concerning Taiwan and the PRC6\ntherein as requested by Department Counsel with the following caveats:\nIn 1949, Taiwan was populated by refugees fleeing a civil war in China. While\nthe State Department substantiates that two million refugees fled the mainland for\nTaiwan after the civil war, Taiwan had a sizeable population of ethnic Chinese (more\nthan 18 million of Taiwan\u2019s current  population of 22.8 million) who are descended\nfrom immigrants from the 18  and 19  centuries. It must be noted that a large portion\nth\nth\nof Taiwan\u2019s population had grown up without the influences of mainland China. As\nreported by the State Department, Taiwan experienced a \u201cJapanization\u201d of the island\nduring Japan\u2019s colonial rule of 1895 to 1945.\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy that retains close ties to China. While cross-\nstrait trade has mushroomed in the past ten years, development of semiofficial cross-\nstrait relations has been \u201chalting\u201d per the State Department. The PRC\u2019s 2005 Anti-\nSecession Law and its demand that Taiwan acknowledge there is only one China\nhave proved barriers to cross-strait dialogue.\nTaiwan\u2019s collection activities (attempts to acquire U.S. economic and\nproprietary information) are ongoing, as evidenced by the January 2006\nconviction and four-year prison sentence of [name omitted] on charges related\nto the theft of sensitive and proprietary information by and for Taiwan\ncompanies. Another recent case links espionage as directly involving the\nTaiwanese government. In September 2004 [name omitted], the Principal\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, pled\nguilty to illegally removing classified materials and to providing false statements\n\nIn footnote 12 of the FORM, the government cited not only the criminal complaint but a \u201cNews Release.\u201d There\n7\nis no news release of record other than the press release from the U.S. Attorney which has nothing to do with the criminal\ncharges filed against the U.S. State Department official.\n6\nto the U.S. Government. [Name omitted] had passed documents to a foreign\nintelligence agent employed by the National Security Bureau, the Taiwanese\nforeign intelligence agency.  While the press release (VII) reports a guilty plea and\nsentence in the first case, it does not support any state involvement or sponsorship\non the part of Taiwanese governmental authorities. The affidavit, filed in support of\na criminal complaint against the State Department official in the second case (V),\ndoes not suffice to prove the misconduct by the Taiwanese government or even the\nState Department official. The government produced nothing that shows the State\nDepartment official pled guilty.7\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges foreign influence concerns because of the Taiwanese residency and\ncitizenship of several family members (Applicant\u2019s father (\u00b6 1.a), brother (\u00b6 1.b), five sisters (\u00b6 1.c),\nbrother-in-law and sister-in-law (\u00b6 1.d), Applicant\u2019s travels to Taiwan in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2002\n(\u00b6 1.e), and Applicant\u2019s service as a technical advisor to a department of the Taiwanese government\nfrom about October 1995 to December 1996 (\u00b6 1.f). \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Taiwanese citizenship and residency of the\nfamily members alleged, and that his contacts with these relatives would continue. He provided\nemployment information for his family members, none of whom worked for the Taiwanese\ngovernment. Applicant acknowledged that during the time he was employed by a communication\ncomponent manufacturing company in Taiwan from about October 1995 to December 1996, he had\ncontact with foreign engineers for Taiwan\u2019s transportation department and he received a small\namount of compensation for his \u201ccasual services.\u201d Applicant indicated that with the exception of\nOctober 1995 to early 1997, he had held security clearances since 1980 and had not harmed the U.S.\ninterests. Applicant also acknowledged his foreign travel to Taiwan as alleged, and added that he had\ntaken more recent trips to Taiwan, in 2005 for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral and in 2006 for sightseeing\nand for matters related to his spouse\u2019s inheritance.\nAfter a thorough review of the documents before me for consideration, including Applicant\u2019s\nrebuttal to the FORM, and after having taken administrative notice as noted above, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 59-year-old principal electrical engineer who has been employed by a major\nU.S. defense contractor since January 1997. Applicant previously held a security clearance from\nabout 1980 to October 1995 for his duties with another defense contracting firm. He has held his\ncurrent secret-level clearance since March 1997.\nApplicant\u2019s background and foreign ties\nA native of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Applicant was raised with his six siblings (one\nbrother and five sisters, all younger) in Taiwan. Their father owned a local business before he retired.\n\n7\nApplicant served mandatory military service as a second lieutenant in Taiwan\u2019s army from July 15,\n1969 to August 15, 1970.\nIn September 1970, Applicant came to the U.S. on a student visa to pursue doctoral studies,\nexpenses paid. He came \u201cwith a single luggage and $200 in his pocket.\u201d He met his spouse, a native\nof the PRC, and they married in the U.S. in January 1972. In June 1975, Applicant was awarded his\nPh. D. degree in electrical engineering.\nIn mid-April 1976, Applicant started working as a senior engineer/principal scientist for a\ndefense contractor in the U.S. A few months later, in July 1976, he and his spouse had their first\nchild, a daughter. A son was born to them in May 1980.\nIn October 1984, Applicant and his spouse became naturalized U.S. citizens, taking the oath\nto renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to\nbear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. After\nabout twenty years with the same defense contractor, Applicant found himself with little work to do.\nAt the urging of a friend, Applicant assumed the position of vice president for a manufacturer of\nconsumer communications/electronics\u2019 components in Taiwan in October 1995. He left his family\nbehind in the U.S. In November 1995, Applicant renewed his Taiwanese passport to ease his entry\ninto and exit from Taiwan, and for medical service and income tax benefits available to Taiwanese\ncitizens. The passport was valid until November 2001.\nIn 1996, the Taiwanese government was planning a high speed rail system. Needing help to\nunderstand railway electromagnetic systems requirements and associated testing methods, engineers\nin Taiwan\u2019s railway transportation department turned to Applicant. On no more than ten occasions,\nhe provided technical advice involving electromagnetic capabilities. Applicant was paid about\n$1,000 total to compensate him for his services and travel and meal costs.\nOn behalf of his Taiwanese employer, Applicant traveled to Canada for a week in late\nNovember 1996 to investigate investment opportunities in Canada. Applicant went with a group of\nTaiwanese businessmen and they visited various provincial government agencies and private\ncompanies in Canada.\nIn late December 1996, Applicant voluntarily resigned from his position in Taiwan and\nrejoined his family in the U.S. Two weeks later, he began working for his current employer as a\nprincipal electrical engineer. In March 1997, he was granted his secret-level security clearance.\nTo celebrate their daughter\u2019s graduation from college and their son\u2019s graduation from high\nschool, Applicant and his spouse took their children on a package tour to the PRC in June 1998.\nAfter five days in the PRC and one day in Hong Kong, they spent five days in Taiwan before\nreturning to the U.S. They visited with family members when in Taiwan. Applicant returned to\nTaiwan in August 1999 for his mother\u2019s funeral, and in September 2000 for his mother-in-law\u2019s\nfuneral. He visited with relatives during both trips.\nIn October 2001, Applicant spent two weeks in the PRC as a tourist. He did not stop in\nTaiwan en route to or from the PRC. In late April 2002, Applicant went to Thailand on a group tour\nfor five days. He stopped in Taiwan for six days to see his relatives. Later that year, he went to\nAustralia and New Zealand for pleasure. He took short trips to Canada in August 2003 and May\n\nThe $50,000 is in New Taiwan or NT dollars.\n8\n8\n2004 for pleasure, but in 2005 returned to Taiwan for his father-in-law\u2019s funeral. On her father\u2019s\ndeath, Applicant\u2019s spouse, her two living siblings, and the family of her deceased brother, each\ninherited a quarter ownership of a condominium in Taiwan and $50,000 (NT).  Applicant is not\n8\nlisted as an owner of the condominium.\nDuring the summer of 2006, Applicant\u2019s son was involved in a National Science Foundation-\nsponsored research program at a university in Japan. Applicant and his spouse met up with their  son\nin Taiwan and they toured an area of Taiwan together and visited with relatives. Applicant\u2019s spouse,\nrequired to cash her inheritance check in person, had the $50,000 (NT) transferred to the U.S. during\nthat trip as well.\nAs of March 2007, Applicant\u2019s father, brother, and five sisters, and his spouse\u2019s living\nsiblings (a brother and a sister) are resident citizens of Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s father is 80 years old and\nlives with Applicant\u2019s brother and family in an area of Taiwan very supportive of Taiwan\u2019s\nsovereignty. Applicant telephones his father about once weekly to check on his well-being. Applicant\nhas contact with his brother occasionally, as he sometimes answers the telephone when Applicant\ncalls their father. Applicant\u2019s brother is 46 years of age and is a part owner of a restaurant in a small\ntown in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s father and brother know of Applicant\u2019s employer by name but\nApplicant does not discuss the specifics of his job with them.\nApplicant\u2019s five sisters are unaware of his employer. The eldest, who is 54 years of age, is\na retired nurse. His 53-year-old sister works as a factory supervisor for an electronics company. Her\nduties used to bring her to the PRC, but she had a stroke in 2006 so Applicant believes further\nbusiness travel is not in her future. The third and fourth sisters are 50 and 48 years old, respectively,\nand do not work outside of their homes. His youngest sister is 45 and a Chinese medicine doctor.\nApplicant visits with his sisters when he is in Taiwan but otherwise has infrequent contact with\nthem. \nThe siblings of Applicant\u2019s spouse are both university professors. Her brother teaches\nengineering and her sister Chinese literature. Applicant speaks with them if he happens to answer\nthe telephone when they call his spouse.\nSince Applicant came to the U.S. in 1970, he has been visited in the U.S. by his parents,\nyoungest sister, and his sister-in-law once each, and by his parents-in-law twice. None of these\nrelatives have been to the U.S. since 1998. His spouse\u2019s brother visited them more frequently as he\ntraveled to the U.S. for conferences and stopped by when convenient.\nOn March 28, 2005, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86). He\nindicated he was a dual citizen of Taiwan and the U.S., possessed a valid Taiwanese passport until\nNovember 2001, worked for the Taiwanese consumer electronics component manufacturer from\nOctober 1995 to December 1996 during which he served as technical adviser to Taiwan\u2019s\ntransportation department on high speed rail issues, and traveled to several foreign countries since\n1998, including to Taiwan in 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2002. He also disclosed the Taiwanese\ncitizenship and residency of his father and siblings.\n\nSee the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2006.\n9\nSee the Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy\n10\nChoices, updated October 9, 2006.\nSee the State Department\u2019s Background Note: Taiwan.\n11\nSee the Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy\n12\nChoices, updated October 9, 2006.\n9\nApplicant\u2019s relatives in Taiwan, and Applicant when he was in Taiwan, have not been\nexploited, manipulated, or subjected to any coercion or pressure because of his employment in the\ndefense sector. He is appreciative of the opportunities provided him and his immediate family in the\nU.S. and indicates he would promptly report any efforts to gain influence through his siblings or in-\nlaws. As for his father, he candidly admits he might \u201chesitate a little,\u201d but he would act in the U.S.\ninterest. He considers himself loyal to the U.S., and cites as proof his dedicated performance for a\ndefense contractor, including after he resumed his defense sector work following one year in Taiwan.\nTaiwan\u2019s political and economic state\nUntil 1986, Taiwan\u2019s political system was effectively controlled by one party, the\nKuomintang. Since ending martial law in 1987, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect\nfor human rights and create a democratic political system. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\nof Taiwan\u2019s current president is made up of largely native Taiwanese who support sovereignty for\nTaiwan. The U.S. has been committed to maintaining cultural, commercial and other nonofficial\nrelations with Taiwan since January 1979, when it formally recognized the government of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China. By formal act of Congress\n(Taiwan Relations Act of 1979), the U.S. is committed to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive\ncharacter in support of Taiwan\u2019s security and stability in the region. Despite the U.S.\u2019 clear and\nconsistent position that Taiwan and the Mainland are part of China, U.S. commercial ties have\nexpanded with Taiwan and the U.S. is supportive of Taiwan\u2019s membership in international\norganizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the Asian Development Bank, where\nindependent statehood is not required for membership.9\nThe PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most important trading partner, putting pressure\non Taiwan\u2019s government to ease restrictions on direct travel to and investment in the PRC. The pro-\nindependence political base in Taiwan believes further economic ties to the PRC will erode Taiwan\u2019s\neconomy.  The PRC\u2019s 2005 Anti-Secession Law aimed at reigning in Taiwan independence\n10\nadvocates, and the PRC\u2019s demand that Taiwan acknowledge there is only one China, have proved\nbarriers to cross-strait dialogue. Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose primary\nmission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has\nnot renounced the use of force against Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s armed forces are equipped with weapons\nobtained primarily from the U.S., but Taiwan has stressed military self-reliance in recent years that\nhas resulted in the growth of indigenous military production.  The U.S. has sought to balance\n11\ncriticisms of the PRC military buildup opposite Taiwan with periodic warnings to the Taiwan\ngovernment to avoid provocative actions and cautions that U.S. support for Taiwan is not\nunconditional.12\n\nSee the National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\n13\nand Espionage. In the report\u2019s appendix, Taiwan is listed as one of the seven countries who are the most active collectors\nof targeted information and technology. The distilled opinions expressed in the report, based on a statistically small\nsample (the views of \u201cnearly a dozen selected Fortune 500 companies\u201d) and very dated, were afforded less weight than\nthe more recent assessments of the U.S. State Department.\n10\nTaiwan was reported to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000.  In\n13\nSeptember 2004, the U.S. government filed charges against a State Department official alleging the\nactive participation by two Taiwanese intelligence officers in acquiring U.S. foreign policy\ninformation. No evidence has been presented that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain access to\nindustrial espionage.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014foreign influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6.\nDisqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\n\n11\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion,\napplies. Applicant\u2019s father and siblings are resident citizens of Taiwan. He shares a close bond with\nhis father, and checks on his well-being about weekly. While he does not telephone his siblings with\nsimilar regularity, he visits with them when in Taiwan.\nFurthermore, the DOHA Appeal Board has held it reasonable for the administrative judge\nto consider the significance not only of an applicant\u2019s ties, but also of his spouse\u2019s ties to a foreign\ncountry and the possible effect they may have on Applicant\u2019s contacts under Guideline B (see ISCR\nCase No. 01-02452, App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002). Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s siblings reside in Taiwan and she\nco-owns with them a condominium inherited on the death of their father in August 2005. These\nsiblings are university professors in Taiwan. DC \u00b6 7(d) sharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and \u00b6 7(e) a substantial business, financial, or\nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation, must also be\nconsidered because of the heightened risk presented through his spouse\u2019s relatives and her financial\ninterest in Taiwan.\nThe government also alleged that Applicant is at risk of undue foreign influence because of\nhis former employment from October 1995 to December 1996 in Taiwan when he had regular\ncontact with foreign nationals, including some Taiwanese government engineers planning a high\nspeed rail system for Taiwan. Absent any evidence of recent contact with his former coworkers or\nTaiwanese government employees or officials, his former contacts do not raise a current security\nconcern under \u00b6 7(b) connection to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation.\nMoreover, I am not persuaded by Department Counsel\u2019s assertion that Applicant is at a\nheightened risk of undue foreign influence from the PRC where Applicant\u2019s only connections to the\nPRC are a couple of pleasure trips, his spouse\u2019s birth in the PRC in 1947, and some business travel\nby one of his sisters to the PRC that is not likely to continue given she suffered a stroke in 2006.\nEven if PRC intelligence is targeted at Taiwan, PRC agents are not likely to be allowed to operate\nwith impunity. While Taiwan and the PRC have expanded commercial ties, Taiwan remains under\nsignificant military threats from the PRC and the current Taiwanese government has a pro-\nindependence bias. It is noted that there are no allegations in the SOR related to the PRC.\nThe heightened risk that does exist because of his ties to Taiwan may be mitigated under \u00b6\n8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. Even if his telephone\nconversations with his father last only a few minutes, Applicant acknowledged that with respect to\nreporting any attempts at undue foreign influence, he \u201cmay hesitate a little, if the coercion or\nexploitation is through [his] father.\u201d While he also maintains that would protect the U.S. interests,\nhe explained it would be because his father would want him to do so. The regard for his father\u2019s\nopinion might make him less vulnerable, although it remains to be seen what Applicant would do\nif faced with a threat to his father\u2019s health and well-being. Applicant does not have a similarly strong\n\nSee the National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection\n14\nand Industrial Espionage for 2000.\n12\nbond with his siblings, but his father lives with his brother, so any improper influence on his brother\nand even his sisters may well impact his father. His contacts with his siblings may be infrequent, but\nthey are not viewed as casual in nature. MC \u00b6 8(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens\nis so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation is not implicated. \nAs for the nature of the country, dated reports of Taiwan targeting U.S. economic and\nproprietary interests in 2000  are counterbalanced by Taiwan\u2019s partnership in a defense pact with\n14\nthe U.S. and Taiwan\u2019s progress in achieving democratic elections, civil liberties, and stable, viable\ngovernmental institutions. As reported by the U.S. State Department, Taiwan has taken dramatic\nsteps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic political system since ending\nmarital law in 1987. Almost all restrictions on the press have ended, restrictions on personal\nfreedoms have been relaxed, and the prohibition against organizing new political parties has been\nlifted. Taiwan also has a history of favorable relations with the U.S. While the U.S. does not support\nindependence for Taiwan and is committed to a one China policy, under the Taiwan Relations Act,\nsigned into law on April 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself, including\nmaking available defensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. U.S. commercial ties with\nTaiwan have been maintained and expanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to jeopardize its\nrelationship with the U.S. by overly pressuring its citizens, but even nations with a history of friendly\nrelations do not always have the same interests.\nConcerning the positions of the family members in Taiwan, Applicant\u2019s siblings are not in\npositions (current restaurant owner, retired nurse, factory supervisor, housewife, Chinese medicine\ndoctor) where their activities are likely of interest to Taiwanese intelligence, military, or security\nofficials. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s siblings are university professors. Applicant\u2019s burden of showing that\ntheir positions do not present a risk of undue foreign influence is not met where there is no\ninformation as to the academic institution(s), or of the activities and associations of the family\nmembers. Even though ten years have passed since Applicant worked in Taiwan, it cannot be ruled\nout that he is known to the Taiwanese transportation department for his expertise, albeit in an area\nthat was not protected U.S. technology. Applicant acknowledged that Taiwan\u2019s military, with its\nrecent stress on military self-reliance, might be interested in his work for the defense contractor.\nAs for his spouse\u2019s foreign financial interest there is no evidence to doubt his claim that the\nproperty is not in his name. Yet, with the record silent as the value of her quarter share in the\ncondominium in Taiwan, I am unable to apply MC \u00b6 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign\nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and\ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\nApplicant\u2019s bonds to his family members, and through his spouse to her siblings, in Taiwan,\ncannot be reasonably characterized as minimal, although MC \u00b6 8(b) also provides for mitigation\nwhere the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that the\nperson can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. There is no\nquestion that Applicant has developed substantial ties to the U.S. since the 1970s. He met and\nmarried his spouse in the U.S. They established a home here where they raised their two children.\nApplicant acquired U.S. citizenship in 1984. He also has about 30 years of combined service for\n\n13\ndefense contractors, with a clearance for more than 25 years. Yet, despite these very significant U.S.\nties, he elected to pursue employment in Taiwan in October 1995, leaving his family behind when\nhis son was a teenager. When in Taiwan, he actively exercised dual citizenship by obtaining a\nTaiwanese passport which would give him travel, tax, and medical advantages. To his credit,\nApplicant has done nothing to doubt the strength of his commitment to his life in the U.S. since he\nrejoined his family in the U.S. in January 1997. Yet,  his actions in 1995/96 including his service to\nthe Taiwanese government, coming as they did after 20 years of working for a defense contractor,\npreclude me from concluding  that his ties to the U.S. are so deep and longstanding as to fall within\nMC \u00b6 8(b).\nNeither his ties to the U.S. nor track record of handling classified information compels\ncontinuation of his clearance. The government is required to conduct periodic reinvestigation to\nassess continued suitability for access, and is not estopped from revisiting a decision to grant\nclearance. Applicant\u2019s secret clearance was apparently renewed on March 11, 1997, about two\nmonths after he started working for his current employer. While he reported on his March 2005 SF\n86 that he had worked in Taiwan and served as a technical adviser to Taiwan\u2019s department of\ntransportation, I cannot speculate as to whether the U.S. government knew of that foreign\nemployment or that Applicant held a valid Taiwanese passport when his clearance was renewed in\n1997. Even if Applicant had candidly disclosed his foreign ties, the decision as to whether to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s clearance is a risk assessment based on the foreign ties that exist as of March\n2007. Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S. and his contributions to the defense effort are not enough to\novercome the substantial risks of undue foreign influence that exist.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31 year-old products support technician for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant is married and has two children, both girls (see exs. 1 and 2; R.T., at 25). Applicant became attracted to drugs at an early age. His parents were heroin addicts and poor parents. His grandparents filled in for his parents and essentially raised him (R.T., at 28). After his grandmother expired in 1994, he lost his way. With his grandfather an alcoholic, he really had no one to provide guidance and structure in his life (R.T., at 28). While still in high school (18 years of age), Applicant attended a party in June 1994 where marijuana was used, and was confronted by police upon leaving the party. Applicant fled the scene and was eventually run down by the police officer who gave chase (R.T., at 28-30). At this point, Applicant offered no resistance. He was arrested, fingerprinted, and charged with eluding/fleeing (on foot) and possession of a controlled substance prohibited (a felony). He was then assigned a court date, and released (R.T., at 32). When he did not appear for his scheduled court date, a bench warrant 3 was issued for his arrest (R.T., at 32-33). Months later, he was cited for a traffic citation and jailed over the weekend on both the citation and the outst",

DOHA recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 4, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 3, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nMarch 5, 2008.  A hearing was held on March 5, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny,\nor revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At the hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of nine exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit.\nThe transcript (R.T.) was received on March 18, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access classified information is\ndenied.\nJune 16, 2008\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested, charged, or\nindicted with four criminal offenses between 1994 and January 1999.  Those four\noffenses are as follows: (1) in June 1994 for eluding/fleeing (on foot) and possession of\na controlled substance prohibited (a felony), for which he pleaded guilty to both counts\n(judgment deferred on eluding/fleeing count), and later charged with failure to pay fines\nand found  guilty to three charges in June 1996, (2) in August 1995 for petty larceny, for\nwhich he later found guilty in June 1996 (including failure to appear on two occasions)\nand served one day in jail, (3) in December 1997 for larceny (a felony) and\nreceiving/disposing of stolen property (a felony, for which a bench warrant issued after\nhis failure to appear for arraignment (still outstanding), and (4) in January 1999 for\ncriminal trespass, for which he pleaded guilty and was fined.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his public trust\napplication of March 2003 by omitting his 1997 larceny indictment and his January 1999\ncriminal trespass arrests, (b) misrepresenting his awareness of his 1997 larceny\nindictment in a follow-up January 2004 signed, sworn statement, \u00a9) falsified his\nNovember 2005 security clearance application (SF-86) by omitting his 1997 felony\nlarceny indictment., and (d) omitting his January 1999 criminal trespass arrest.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of his four alleged\noffenses: He denied his alleged 1997 larceny indictment.  Applicant also denied\nfalsifying either of his trust applications and making any false misrepresentations to a\ninvestigator about his 1997 larceny indictment.  In further explanation of his omission of\nhis 1997 larceny indictment, Applicant claimed he was never charged or notified of any\nindicted offense and had no recollection of any such charged offense.  \nFindings of Fact\n           Applicant is a 31 year-old products support technician for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is married and has two children, both girls (see exs. 1 and 2; R.T., at\n25).  Applicant became attracted to drugs at an early age.  His parents were heroin\naddicts and poor parents.  His grandparents filled in for his parents and essentially\nraised him (R.T., at 28).  After his grandmother expired in 1994, he lost his way.  With\nhis grandfather an alcoholic, he really had no one to provide guidance and structure in\nhis life  (R.T., at 28).\nWhile still in high school (18 years of age), Applicant attended a party in June\n1994 where marijuana was used, and was confronted by police upon leaving the party.\nApplicant fled the scene and was eventually run down by the police officer who gave\nchase (R.T., at 28-30).  At this point, Applicant offered no resistance.  He was arrested,\nfingerprinted, and charged with eluding/fleeing (on foot) and possession of a controlled\nsubstance prohibited (a felony).  He was then assigned a court date, and released\n(R.T., at 32).   When he did not appear for his scheduled court date, a bench warrant\n\n3\nwas issued for his arrest (R.T., at 32-33).  Months later, he was cited for a traffic citation\nand jailed over the weekend on both the citation and the outstanding bench warrant\n(R.T., at 34).  After spending the weekend in jail, he was released to attend his court\narraignment.  When he appeared in court, he pleaded guilty to both the traffic offense\nand the eluding/failure to appear offenses. The court accepted his guilty plea, credited\nhim for the two days he served in jail, and imposed a fine (R.T., at 34).  At the time of\nhis arrest, Applicant had dropped out of high school.  Later, he returned to school and\ncompleted his high school educational requirements (R.T., at 35).\nIn August 1995, Applicant was charged with petty larceny (a misdemeanor under\nSec. 30-16-1 of State Code), and later for twice failing to appear in court on the charge\n(see ex. 6: R.T., at 37-38).  He had walked out of a store with a tea shirt he did not pay\nfor and was arrested for shoplifting.  In 1996, he was picked up by police for a traffic-\nrelated offense and jailed for a day (see ex. 3).  In court on the charges, Applicant\npleaded guilty to three charges (including the larceny charge) and was fined (R.T., at\n38-39). \nIn December 1997, Applicant was indicted for larceny and receiving/disposing of\nstolen property, each charge a felony (see ex. 7).  Applicant was never arrested for the\ncovered offense, and indicated that he knew nothing about the indictment issuance\nwhen a government investigator inquired about it several years later (see exs. 3 and 7).\nPressed to account for a reported stolen wedding ring by a woman he worked for back\nin December 1997, Applicant acknowledged taking the ring and later pawning it without\nthe permission or knowledge of the owner (R.T., at 49-51). Applicant later apologized to\nthe ring\u2019s owner for taking her ring (R.T., at 51-52).  When he failed to appear for his\nscheduled arraignment in January 1998 on the pending charges, however, a bench\nwarrant was issued.  Applicant attributes his failure to appear to his lack of notice, which\nthe case docket appears to corroborate.  Until this year, the issued warrant associated\nwith the 1997 charges remained outstanding (see ex. 9).  In March 2008 (following the\nhearing), the presiding court dismissed the charges and cancelled the bench warrant\n(see ex. B).  \nApplicant was arrested in January 1999 for criminal trespass.  He made a wrong\nu-turn into a store lot and received a trespassing ticket from police (R.T., at 39-40).\nApplicant assures that the other cars making similar u-turns into the store lot also\nreceived trespassing citations (R.T., at 40).   While he denies any court appearance, the\ncourt docket covering the case reports he pleaded guilty to the charge in court and paid\nthe imposed fine.  The case docket also reports that the court deferred findings on the\nmerits (see ex. 8; R.T., at 42, 59).  Applicant\u2019s assurances he paid the issued ticket and\nmade no court appearance cannot be reasonably reconciled with the case docket.  The\ncriminal trespass charge is listed as a misdemeanor offense and could reasonably be\nexpected to require a court appearance absent an express waiver from the court.  Any\ndispensing of a court appearance should have some reference in the case docket. It\ndoes not and cannot be presumed in this situation (see ex. 8)\n \nAsked to complete a public trust application in March 2003, Applicant answered\nquestion 16 of the application (inquiring about his police record over the previous seven\nyears) in the negative.  In answering \u201cno\u201d to the question, he omitted both his 1997\nlarceny indictment and his 1999 criminal trespass arrest.  Applicant attributes his 1997\n\n4\nlarceny indictment omission to his lack of awareness of the indictment at the time he\ncompleted his 2003 application (R.T., at 55-58).  He attributes his 2003 omission of his\n1999 trespass arrest to memory lapse and a mistaken understanding of the scope of the\nquestion (R.T., at 54-55, 58-59).  Since he was only cited (not arrested), it never\noccurred to him that the citation was potentially covered by question 16.  \nApplicant\u2019s assigned reasons for his omissions draw some contradictions from\nthe record.  The case docket covering the 1997 offense recites larceny/receiving stolen\nproperty charges filed against Applicant in December 1997 (ex. 7).  The same case\ndocket reports the issuance of a bench warrant in January 1998 and the return of an\nundelivered notice of arraignment in January 1998 (ex. 7).   Neither the case docket nor\nany other documents in the case provide any clarifying clues on the issue of whether or\nnot Applicant was notified of the scheduled arraignment or the issuance of a bench\nwarrant to insure Applicant\u2019s availability at each of the scheduled proceedings. \nBy contrast, the case docket covering Applicant\u2019s 1999 criminal arrest reports a\nscheduled arraignment on the misdemeanor charge in January 1999, and Applicant\u2019s\nensuing appearance, entry of a guilty plea, payment of a fine, the court\u2019s deferral of any\nfindings on the charge, and the closing of the case in September 2006 (ex. 8).  It is quite\napparent from the docket entries on this 1999 charge that Applicant made a court\nappearance on the charge and was informed of the court\u2019s deferred finding in the case.\nIf this was not the case, it became incumbent on Applicant to provide better\nexplanations of the circumstances in which he entered his guilty plea.\nWhen subsequently asked about his 1997 indictment and 1999 arrest in a\nsigned, sworn statement he gave in January 2004, Applicant could remember no more\nabout either event until asked about them specifically (see ex. 3; R.T., at 56-57).  When\nconfronted with the 1997 larceny charges, Applicant insisted he was \u201cnot aware of any\n7/1997 larceny charge\u201d (ex. 3).  This may be true, since the 1997 case docket does not\ncontain any notice information.  At the same time, his statement implicitly acknowledges\nhis being informed of a 1997 larceny charge.  With this information, he was in a position\nto look into the status of the charge and any outstanding warrant before executing any\nfuture security clearance applications.  In this same signed, sworn statement, Applicant\nalso addressed his 1999 trespass citation, but provided no further details about any\ncourt appearance, guilty plea, and deferred finding referenced in the 1999 case docket. \nApplicant submitted another security clearance application in 2005: specifically,\nan SF-86 he completed in November 2005.  In this application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto two questions: question 21, which inquired about felony offenses, and question 26,\nwhich asked him about other offenses in the past seven years.  Applicant omitted anew\nboth his 1997 larceny charge and his January 1999 trespass charge.  He attributes his\nnegative responses to the same reasons he supplied for his earlier 2003 omissions:\nunawareness, memory lapse, and a mistaken understanding of the scope of question\n26 (R.T., at 58-59). \nApplicant\u2019s assured lack of knowledge of his 1997 indictment and ensuing charge\nis plausible only so much.  While clearly aware of the underlying facts based on his\nexchanges with the employer whose wedding ring he misappropriated, it is certainly\nplausible that he was not aware of any formal charges when he filled out his trust\n\n5\napplication in 2003.  Applicant could not plausibly rely on the lack of notice of the 1997\ncharges, though, when he completed his 2005 SF-86.  For by this time, he had been\nmade aware of the pending 1997 larceny charge by the OPM investigator who\ninterviewed him and took his statement in 2004.  Only by a wilful refusal to look into any\npending 1997 charges could Applicant claim a continued lack of awareness of any\npending charges.\nWilful avoidance of the truth is insufficient to enable Applicant to sustain his\nevidentiary claim to continued unawareness of the 1997 charge.  Neither his signed,\nsworn statement nor the 1997 case docket corroborate Applicant\u2019s unawareness claims.\nSo, while Applicant is able to credibly demonstrate that his omission of his 1997 larceny\ncharge in his 2003 trust application was inadvertent, he cannot avert inferences of\nknowing and willful omission of the charge in his ensuing 2005 SF-86.\nCredibility issues arise, too, with respect to Applicant\u2019s multiple omissions of his\n1999 trespass charge.  Omitting his 1999 trespass arrest on one clearance application\nmight plausibly be attributable to memory lapse and mistaken apprehension.  However,\nhis omission of his confirmed guilty plea on two separate applications covering the 1999\noffense strains plausibility limits, and cannot credibly be attributable to memory lapse\nand confusion under all off the circumstances extant at the time.  Based on the case\ndocket covering the 1999 offense, Applicant inferentially appeared in court to enter a\nguilty plea to the criminal trespass charges, was credited with the payment of a fine, and\nwas privy to the court\u2019s deferring of any findings in the matter (ex. 8).  Without any\nprobative documentation of a waived court appearance, inferences must warrant that\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of his 1999 criminal trespass in both his 2003 and 2005 clearance\napplications were made knowingly and willfully.  \nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisor, coworkers and friends (see ex. A).\nThey find him to be of good character and a reliable and trusted work provider and\nasset to his family and community. \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n\n6\nCriminal Conduct\n      \u201cThe Concern. \u201cCriminal activity create doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 30).\nPersonal Conduct\n    \u201cThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process\u201d (Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15).\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\n       Applicant is a well regarded support technician with several criminal arrests and\nconvictions over a five-year span between 1994 and 1999.  Applicant\u2019s arrest/conviction\nhistory, while aged, raise initial security concerns over his eligibility to hold a security\nclearance.  Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s omissions of his two\nmost recent incidents in his answers to a 2003 public trust application and an ensuing\n2005 security clearance application.  \n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s criminal history\nApplicant\u2019s three arrests/citation and indictment over larceny warrant initial\nconsideration of two disqualifying conditions of the  Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal\nconduct: DC 31a, \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, \u201c and DC 31\u00a9),\n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged.\u201d  While Applicant\u2019s arrests/citation all resulted in guilty pleas and\nconvictions, his potentially more serious larceny offense for which he was indicted for in\n1997 was dismissed by the court presiding over the case.  Because Applicant admits to\nthe underlying larceny charge of taking his employer\u2019s wedding ring and later pawning it,\ndismissal of the underlying charges does not moot the underlying conduct.  \nApplicant may find no mitigation comfort in MC 32\u00a9), \u201cevidence that the person\ndid not commit the offense\u201d of the guidelines for criminal conduct.  His convictions\nrelative to all three of his arrests (i.e., in 1995, 1996, and 1999) are each admitted.\nApplicant also admits his underlying conduct relative to his 1997 indictment.  It is\nevident, too, however that  the underlying conduct that pertains to each of his arrests\nare aged and bear less relevance to Applicant\u2019s current clearance worthiness.  His first\nline supervisor, coworkers, and friends who are familiar with his work, home, and\ncommunity commitments credit him with being conscientious, considerate, and helpful.\nThese collective impressions are probative in enabling Applicant to mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s criminal conduct concerns.  Taking  into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances developed in the record, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nthe allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of the SOR.\nWhole person assessment also favors Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts.  Applicant\u2019s\narrests and underlying offenses all occurred during Applicant\u2019s high school years and in\nthe four years that ensued.  Since his last incident in 1999, Applicant has exhibited\nresponsible work in his work, home, and community.  His first line supervisor,\ncoworkers, and friends who are familiar with his work, home, and community\ncommitments speak positively of his reliability and trustworthiness.  Their impressions\nwarrant considerable weight to be accorded Applicant\u2019s exhibited conscientious\nbehavior he has demonstrated in his work, home, and community over the past eight\nyears \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant succeeds in making a convincing\nshowing that he has both the maturity and seasoned resource support to avert any\nrecurrent problems with judgment lapses related to his past confrontations with law\nenforcement. There is sufficient evidence to warrant safe assessments that he is no\nlonger at risk of judgment impairment associated with his past criminally-related\nconduct.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d\nof the SOR.\nPublic Trust/SF-86 omissions\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list all of his of his arrests/indictment/citation in his 2003 public trust\napplication and 2005 SF-86.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see\n\n8\nclassified information that the margins for excusing candor lapses are necessarily\nnarrow.\nBy omitting his 1997 indictment and 1999 trespassing citation in each of his\napplications, Applicant failed to furnish materially important background information\nneeded by the government to properly process and evaluate his security updates.  His\nclaims of unawareness and misapprehension of the questions draw mixed inferences.\nWhile his omission of his 1997 charges in his 2003 trust application is plausible and\ncredible under all of the circumstances considered, his omission of his 1997 charge in\nhis 2005 SF-86 and his omissions of his 1999 criminal trespass charge in both of his\napplications are not. \nApplicant\u2019s ensuing omission of his 1997 larceny charge in his 2005 SF-86\nfollowed his being confronted with the charge in his 2004 OPM interview and could not\nbe plausibly omitted in his 2005 application without a determined disregard of the likely\nexistence of the 1997 larceny charge.  Based on his own account of his pawning his\nemployer\u2019s wedding ring and his being confronted with a 1997 charge associated with\nthe incident by the OPM investigator who interviewed him in 2004, he was possessed of\nenough personal information about the incident to confidently list the incident in his\n2005 SF-86 or further acquaint himself with the details of the incident.\nApplicant\u2019s assurances of forgetting about the 1999 offense and treating it as an\nadministrative citation amenable to satisfactory disposition without a court appearance\nare undermined by the case docket covering the offense. A plain reading of the case\ndocket makes quite clear that Applicant did appear for his arraignment in January 1999\nand was privy to the court\u2019s crediting him with payment of the ordered fine and deferring\nof a finding in the matter.  Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s claims of memory\nlapse and confusion cannot be reconciled with the actual reports of the 1999 proceeding\nin the case docket.\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of his 1997 larceny charge and 1999 criminal trespass\ncharges require application of a disqualifying condition (DC) for personal conduct of the\nGuidelines: 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, because his omissions of his 1997\ncharge (in the SF-86 of 2005 only) and 1999 charges are neither isolated nor followed\nby prompt and good faith corrections of his omissions.  Under these circumstances, he\ncannot claim the benefit of any of the potentially applicable mitigating conditions. \nAddressing the availability of mitigating conditions to mitigate materials omissions\nin a security clearance application (and implicitly in any trust application), the Appeal\nBoard has not only found the use of the predecessor to mitigating condition (MC) 17(c)\n(which is A5.1.3.2) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct (\u201cthe offense is\nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\n\n9\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) to be unavailable to\napplicants seeking mitigation by treating the omission as isolated, but it has denied\napplicants availability of MC 17(a) and its predecessor mitigating condition (\u201cthe\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts\u201d).  Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with\nDISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January1995).\n \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraphs. 2.a, 2/b, and 2.d of Guideline E.  Favorable\nconclusions warrant as to sub-paragraph 2.c.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusion\n        In light  of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted the SOR allegations except for 1.d. and 2.c. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is a 26-year-old geoscientist employed by a defense contractor since June 2002. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained fraudulently in fall 2002. When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in June 2002 (G.E. 1), he deliberately concealed his marijuana use between October 1998 and April 2002 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 27 (illegal drug use, last seven years). In fact, he had a significant history of marijuana use during his college years\u2014sometimes as often as twice per week\u2014and had contributed money to purchase marijuana for group use. 2 Applicant had better reason than most to know that illegal drug use was a security concern for the government and that he would be asked about illegal drug use on his clearance application. In spring 2002, Applicant had been listed as a reference on a friend\u2019s clearance application, and had been interviewed by a government investigator about the friend\u2019s reported marijuana use. During this interview, Applicant reported all the details he knew of his friend\u2019s marijuana use, but also learned how major a security concern past illegal drug use could be. Applicant stated (Answer) that he falsified his drug history on his clearance application because if the government was that concerned about his friend\u2019s drug use (only 3-4 times), \u201cthen there would be no way the government or my",

Clearance denied.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive).\n1\nThe extent of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is unimportant to this case, except that it was relevant and material\n2\nto his clearance application in June 2002 and was sufficiently significant that it would likely have resulted in further\ninvestigation into his drug use and issuance of an SOR addressing his drug involvement.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 3 January 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of\npersonal conduct and criminal conduct.  Applicant\u2019s undated answer initially requested a decision\n1\nwithout hearing, but on 25 May 2007, he requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 12\nJune 2007, and I convened a hearing 2 July 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 11 July 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations except for 1.d. and 2.c. Accordingly, I incorporate\nhis admissions as findings of fact. He is a 26-year-old geoscientist  employed by a defense contractor\nsince June 2002. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained fraudulently in fall 2002.\nWhen Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in June 2002 (G.E. 1),  he deliberately\nconcealed his marijuana use between October 1998 and April 2002 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question\n27 (illegal drug use, last seven years). In fact, he had a significant history of marijuana use during\nhis college years\u2014sometimes as often as twice per week\u2014and had contributed money to purchase\nmarijuana for group use.  \n2\nApplicant had better reason than most to know that illegal drug use was a security concern\nfor the government and that he would be asked about illegal drug use on his clearance application.\nIn spring 2002, Applicant had been listed as a reference on a friend\u2019s clearance application, and had\nbeen interviewed by a government investigator about the friend\u2019s reported marijuana use. During this\ninterview, Applicant reported all the details he knew of his friend\u2019s marijuana use, but also learned\nhow major a security concern past illegal drug use could be.\nApplicant stated (Answer) that he falsified his drug history on his clearance application\nbecause if the government was that concerned about his friend\u2019s drug use (only 3-4 times), \u201cthen\nthere would be no way the government or my company would understand using it a few more\ntimes over a couple of years.\u201d [Emphasis added.] At hearing, he claimed he was concerned that he\nwould be prosecuted for his drug use (Tr. 64, 75).\nIn September 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. Given a\nspecific opportunity to disclose his drug use, he categorically denied using any illegal drugs,\nincluding marijuana, from 1996 to the present\u2014the relevant time period for illegal drug use.\nApplicant was ultimately granted a clearance.               \n\nApplicant had asked a previous FSO if they could listen to a music CD on company computers at work,\n3\nand had been given permission to do so provided the CD reader was un-writeable\u2014i.e., incapable of transmitting\ndata. Despite this limitation, Applicant decided it would be permissible to download the music files into the company\ncomputers. His new FSO discovered this and Applicant received verbal instruction to not download any more files\nonto the company computer. SOR \u00b61.d. alleges that Applicant answered falsely when he denied having any\ndisciplinary actions at his company when asked by a government investigator in March 2006. Applicant stated that\nthis incident did not come to mind when the investigator posed the question, and my reading of the circumstances\nleads me to conclude that this incident did not rise to the level of a disciplinary incident that should have been\nreported in response to the question. However, the incident does demonstrate the degree to which Applicant was\nprepared to ignore the instructions given to him, and reinterpret them to permit conduct that had not been specifically\nauthorized (1.c.).\n3\nIn October 2005, Applicant\u2019s company nominated him for a higher level of clearance, and\nhe completed a second clearance application (G.E. 2). This time, he disclosed that he had used\nmarijuana between October 1998 and April 2002. However, when asked about his frequency of use,\nhe answered \u201cunknown.\u201d In doing so, he stated that he relied on the advice of a friend who was a\nfacility security officer (FSO) at another company (Tr. 76, 78). Not until March 2006, when he was\nagain interviewed by a government investigator, did any government agent know the full extent of\nApplicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use.\nThe SOR alleges, and Applicant admits, three additional instances of minor misconduct. In\nNovember 1998, he was cited for underage possession of alcohol, a civil offense under state law, was\nawarded a year of unsupervised probation, and fined. In May 2004, he was verbally counseled by the\ncompany FSO after he downloaded music files onto the company\u2019s classified hard drive.  In\n3\nSeptember 2004, he was charged with disorderly conduct after a college football game, but the\ncharges were dismissed after he completed 32 hours of community service.\n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s character references (A.E. A) has known him as a student, co-worker, and\nsupervisor, and praises his handling of classified information. He recommends Applicant for a\nclearance. However, he does not appear to be aware of Applicant\u2019s falsifications. Applicant\u2019s other\ncharacter reference praised him in similar terms, but was only made aware of Applicant\u2019s\nfalsification of his clearance application the morning of the hearing. He had not been made aware\nof Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his drug use during the September 2002 interview.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n5\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n6\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or conviced;\n4\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.4\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E and J, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. He deliberately concealed his illegal drug use from\nthe government.  He did so knowing that his illegal drug use was of major security concern to the\n5\ngovernment, and believing that his job and clearance were at risk if he told the truth. Further, none\nof the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information was relevant to a\nclearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the government from evaluating his illegal\ndrug use in a timely fashion, and at a time when such recent drug use would have raised significant\nsecurity concerns. In addition, the government detrimentally relied on Applicant\u2019s falsifications in\ngranting his clearance. Finally, his disclosure of illegal drug use in October 2005  was neither prompt\nnor forthright. It was merely convenient for Applicant, having now worked for his employer for\nseveral years and having put some distance between him and his drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer clearly establishes that he intended to conceal his illegal drug use from\nthe government and effect the course of his background investigation. This conduct violated 18\nU.S.C. \u00a71001,  whether he was successful in effecting the course of his investigation or not.\n6\nHowever, in this case his falsifications did influence the investigation, and he was granted his\nclearance.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his illegal drug use demonstrates a lack of candor required of\ncleared personnel. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse\ninformation about an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The government relies on\napplicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it is perceived\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse information about\nhimself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations or other\nsecurity concerns in the future, something the government relies on to perform damage assessments\nand limit the compromise of classified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put\nhis personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E and J against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant omitted material facts from his security clearance application. He, however, did\nnot intentionally falsify his answers. His speeding tickets are minor violations of the rules which do\nnot impact on his security worthiness. There are no applicable disqualifying factors under Guideline\nE, which is found in favor of Applicant. Guideline J is not established. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated July 11, 2007, at 1-2; Tr. at 53, 55. Although Applicant admitted to\n1\n1.a, in light of the record evidence as a whole, I find he denied intentionally falsifying his answer.\nId.; In 1.c., Applicant admitted the conduct alleged, but denied he intentionally falsified his answer.\n2\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated October 10, 2004) at 1, 3; Tr. at 25-26, 39.\n3\n2\nOn April 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the\ncase be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked. On July 11, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the\nallegations. He requested a hearing. \nThis matter was assigned to another administrative judge on August 16, 2007. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on September 21, 2007. Due to a personal emergency, DOHA reassigned this\ncase to me on October 10, 2007. I held a hearing on October 16, 2007. Eleven government exhibits\n(GE), 1 through 11, were marked and admitted into evidence. Applicant did not submit any\ndocuments into evidence, although he testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October\n24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline E, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.a(1), 1.a.(2),\n1.a.(4), 1.b., 1.c.(1), and 1.e. of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He\n1\ndenied the remaining allegations, including intentional falsification of his answers to his security\nclearance application (SF-86).  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\n2\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 29 years old. Although he is a listed employee of a defense contractor, that is\nsponsoring him for a security clearance, he currently does not perform any duties. He has worked\nas a security guard for this company, which does not offer him continuous full-time employment.\nHe is not married.3\nApplicant graduated high school in 1996 and joined the United States Army two months\nlater. He served four years on active duty, receiving an honorable discharge in 2000. He then served\nin the Army Reserves from 2000 until 2004. The Army Reserves assigned him to units within a 50-\nmile radius of his residence. While on active duty, the Army withdrew his driving privileges on post\nafter he had received several speeding tickets. Subsequent to the withdrawal of his driving privileges,\n\nMost traffic offenses are violations of the motor vehicle laws, not criminal conduct.\n4\nGE 2 (Interrogatory answer and attachment) at 6; GE 6 (Letter, dated August 23, 2003) at 1; Tr. at 32-35, 47-\n5\n50.\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 2; GE 2, supra note 5, at 4-6; Tr. at 30-31, 39-41, 53.\n6\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 2-4; GE 2, supra note 5, at 5-6; Tr. at 44, 45, 47.\n7\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 5; GE 5 (Court information sheet); GE 7 (Court information sheet); GE 8 (Court\n8\ninformation sheet); GE 9 (Court information sheet); Tr. at 57, 59.\n3\nthe military police stopped him for driving on base. The Army instituted an Article 15 proceeding\nagainst Applicant for failure to obey an order. As punishment, the Army reduced him in rank,\nimposed forfeiture of pay and ordered him to perform 60 days of extra duty. He held a secret\nclearance while in the Army reserves. In 2003, the Army sent him a warning about possible future\nsuspension of his security clearance if he continued with his criminal conduct, which the Army\ndefined as multiple traffic offenses.  The Army sent this letter to a command 300 miles away, not\n4\nhis command. Thus, Applicant never received the letter. The Army never revoked his clearance.5\nAfter his discharge from active duty, Applicant began work as a communications technician,\ninstalling cable lines. Two years later, in 2002, his employer terminated him for poor performance.\nHe immediately began work at another communications company, as a disconnect technician. Nine\nmonths later, in May 2003, this company terminated him for low performance. For the next seven\nmonths, he worked as a computer salesman. In a company wide layoff, this company terminated him\nas he had low performance. He next worked for a temporary agency as a computer technician. In\nJune 2004, he accepted a job to work in construction overseas. He worked in a foreign country for\nthree months, then resigned from his position and returned to the United States. He began his next\nposition in October 2004, but was laid off from the job in August 2005 because of a business\ndownturn. He admitted being late to this job about once every other week and that he had been\ncounseled about his tardiness. He is currently employed by a security company, but has not been\nassigned to a specific duty post recently.6\nApplicant completed his SF-86 on October 20, 2004. Although he listed all his employment\nup to the date of his application, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the Question 20, which inquires about job\nterminations. During his interview with the investigator, Applicant explained that he read the\nquestionnaire quickly and did not read the questions thoroughly, which he also explained at the\nhearing. When asked on cross-examination if he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 20 because he thought\nthe information would negatively impact his employability, he agreed. He also testified he didn\u2019t\nbelieve that he knowingly denied this information, rather he just skimmed the question.7\nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 26, which asked if, in the last seven years, he had\nbeen arrested, charged or convicted of any offense not listed under other similar questions. He failed\nto list his December 13, 2000 speeding ticket for driving 93 m.p.h. in a 55m.p.h. speed limit, which\nresulted in a guilty finding, a fine of $500 and costs of $71. He did not list this four-year-old ticket\nas he did not remember the amount of his fine. Between December 2000 and January 2001, he\nreceived three additional speeding tickets for driving around 40 m.p.h. in a 25 m.p.h speed limit. The\ncourt fined him between $24 and $51 plus costs of $30 on each ticket.8\n\nGE 3 (Court docket sheet); GE 4 (Court information sheet); GE 10 (Court case information sheet); Tr. at 47-50,\n9\n52.\nGE 2, supra note 5; Tr. at 62-65.\n10\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n11\n4\nThe SOR does not allege falsification for his failure to list his Article 15 disciplinary action.\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated that he did not believe Question 25 pertained to the actions taken\nagainst him. When questioned, he could not explain the meaning of non-judicial punishment.\nLikewise, the SOR identifies the receipt of a speeding ticket for driving 94 m.p.h. in a 65 m.p.h.\nspeed limit in the early morning hours in January 2005, which resulted in a guilty finding for driving\n15-19 m.p.h. over the speed limit, a fine of $200 and costs of $61, as a conduct problem. Twelve\ndays after receiving this ticket, he received a ticket for defective equipment, which resulted in a $200\nfine and $81 in costs. This ticket is not listed in the SOR.9\nThe government submitted into evidence Applicant\u2019s response to one interrogatory\npropounded to him. The interrogatory instructions requested him to authenticate the attached\ndocument. Specifically, the interrogatory asked him: \u201cDoes the report of investigation reflect\naccurately the information you provided to the authorized investigator for the Department of Defense\non the day you were interviewed?\u201d [emphasis supplied] He answered \u201cyes\u201d. The investigator wrote\na summary of the information provided by Applicant. The document does not reflect that any\ninformation came from a source other than Applicant, nor does the record contain any documents\nfrom other sources. The summary documentation supports Applicant\u2019s testimony that he voluntarily\nprovided the negative information concerning his employment, traffic offenses, and juvenile record\nto the investigator. Applicant also provided testimony regarding his actions in reporting a failure by\na co-worker to properly use a cell phone when overseas to show his integrity.10\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.11\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n12\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n14\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd., Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Decision and Reversal Order, Jan. 27, 1995); Directive, Enclosure\n16\n3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n17\nId.\n18\nId.; Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n19\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n20\n5\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n12\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n13\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n14\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n15\nclearance decision.16\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n17\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n18\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n19\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n20\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n21\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n6\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) Under DC \u00b6 16 (a) \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire . . .\u201d, the government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 20 and 26. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified\nhis answer to these questions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has\nthe burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For\n21\nDC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or\nfalsification in his answer was deliberate.\nApplicant credibly testified about his carelessness in preparing the answers to his SF-86.\nBecause he listed all his jobs in the application, he had no intent to hide his past employment from\nthe government. When he met with the investigator, he self reported the negative information about\nthe termination of his employment at four jobs, which the investigator summarized in the report.\nApplicant could easily have avoided providing this unfavorable information, hoping that his former\nemployers would not be contacted. He did not make this choice. His testimony is consistent with his\nstatements to the investigator. Even though he conceded on cross-examination that his employability\ncould be impacted by revealing the reasons for his terminations, I find his concession does not negate\nhis explanation for answering \u201cno\u201d because the government suggested this reason to him through\nits question. Moreover, it is not clear what he was thinking at the time he completed his SF-86. I\nconclude that his testimony is credible, I find his account of his conduct credibly explains his\nerroneous answers. I find that Applicant did not intentionally falsify his answer to Questions 20 and\n26 because he credibly testified about his careless and sloppy preparation of his security clearance\napplication. Allegations 1.a. (1)-(4) and 1.c. under Guideline E are found in favor of Applicant.\nA security concern may also arise under DC \u00b6 16 (d), which states:\nCredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available\ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include\nbreach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary\ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive\ncorporate or other government protected information;\n\n7\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior\nin the workplace;\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rules violations;\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or\nother employer\u2019s time or resources. [emphasis\nsupplied]\nApplicant\u2019s numerous speeding tickets in the past may raise a question of rules violations.\nIn looking at this conduct under a whole person analysis and from a commonsense approach, his\nconduct does not make him unreliable, untrustworthy or a person of questionable judgment. Since\nJanuary of 2002, nearly six years ago, he received one ticket for excessive speed. People commonly\ndrive the highways 10 to 15 miles above the posted speed limits. While his speed was very high on\ntwo occasions, people driving the posted speed limit can cause a traffic hazard if their speed is\nsignificantly lower than the flow of traffic. To find that Applicant\u2019s failure to drive the posted speed\nlimit constitutes conduct so serious as to raise a security concern defies common sense, particularly\nin light of the common driving patterns of Americans. Applicant has modified his driving since 2002\nmost of the time. It has been almost three years since his last ticket. He continues to improve his\ncompliance with the general rules for driving on the roads. He received three tickets for driving too\nfast in a 25 m.p.h. speed zone, the last in 2002, which is not an uncommon driving practice. His\ndriving speed raises little concern about his security worthiness because he has changed is driving\nhabits in the last six years. He is improving his driving skills and attitude towards speed. Although\nhe drove at a high rate of speed on two occasions, his other driving offenses out not out of the norm.\nThis disqualifying condition is not applicable because under the whole-person assessment, the issues\nof questionable judgment, untrustworthiness and unreliability are not supported by the record as a\nwhole.\nIn reaching my final conclusion, I have considered the whole person concept in evaluating\nAppellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. He graduated from high school\nthen joined the Army. With the exception of his one Article 15, he performed his duties as expected.\nHe developed some technical skills in installing or repairing communication equipment, which\nenabled him to obtain private sector employment. He lost several jobs because of low productivity,\nwhich can mean several things, including he worked too slowly, even if accurately, or he lacked the\nproper training to perform the duties quickly and accurately. The record contains no evidence he as\nto the reasons he lost his jobs. His slow work pace, which does not mean he is lazy, does not reflect\non his security worthiness. The record contains no evidence that during the time he held a security\nclearance, he violated security procedures. In fact, he reported a co-worker for violating security\nprocedures when using a cell phone. Despite negative information, Applicant has shown that he is\ntrustworthy and reliable. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant. In light of my Guideline E\nfindings on falsification, Guideline J is found in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n8\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-e: \nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant was born and educated in Iraq, and later moved to Kuwait. In \n1991, he and his immediate family immigrated to the United States to escape \npersecution from Saddam Hussein who invaded Kuwait. They became U.S. \ncitizens in 2003, the same year he began his current position with a federal \ncontractor. From 2006 to 2007, he worked in Iraq as a translator and civil \nengineer for the U.S. Army. Two siblings live in Iraq where they are under \nconstant threat of persecution because of their religion. He paid or resolved the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. He mitigated security \nconcerns pertaining to financial considerations, but not those pertaining to \nforeign influence. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn January 10, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF 86).1 On March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 2 pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, \ndated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and revised. 3 The SOR \nalleges security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and F \n(Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \na clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nIn an answer notarized on May 28, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and elected to have his case decided without a hearing.4 However, \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing. On June 29, 2007, the case was \nassigned to another administrative judge, and reassigned to me on August 23, \n2007. On August 24, 2007, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing, scheduling the \nhearing for September 11, 2007. At the hearing, Department Counsel introduced \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 into evidence. Applicant introduced \nApplicant Exhibits (AX) A through J into evidence. At the conclusion of the \nhearing, I left the record open until September 21, 2007, to give Applicant time \nto submit additional documents. On September 18, 2007, Applicant submitted \ntwo exhibits that I marked as AX K and L. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 20, 2007. On September 28, 2007, Applicant \nsubmitted three additional exhibits that I marked as AX M, N and O. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to any of the submissions.  \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 GX 1 (Electronic Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance Application).  \n \n2 Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 30, 2007, is the source for the facts in the \nremainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n3 On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications \nand other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) \nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as \namended, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s case is \nresolved under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR, notarized on May 28, 2007, received at DOHA on \nJune 6, 2007. \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n3\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in GX \n7. 5 Department Counsel also provided supporting documents to show the basis \nfor the facts in GX 7.  (GX I to IV and VI to XI\u2014listed in GX 7). Applicant had \nno objection to the introduction of the documents. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used \nfor administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). \nThe most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to \nnotice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, \nADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice). I took administrative notice of various facts \nderived from GX 7 as indicated under subheading \u201cIraq\u201d of this decision. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT  \n \nApplicant admitted the underlying facts in the SOR with clarification of \ncertain facts. 6 His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After \na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n   \nApplicant is 65 years old. 7 He was born in Iraq and attended college \nthere. In 1971, he received a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering. He \nmarried an Iraqi woman in 1972. They have four children, all of whom were \nborn in Iraq. In 1983, he moved to Kuwait because Saddam Hussein came into \npower and began persecuting Christians. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, Applicant \nlost his job and moved his family to the United States in 1991. (Tr. 30). He, \nalong with his wife and four children, became U.S. citizens in December 2003.  \n \nAfter arriving in the United States in 1991, Applicant started a printing \ncompany. He was unable to support his family with the business and decided to \nlook for a job. In 1996, he began working as a construction superintendent and \nearning about $40,000 annually. That salary was insufficient to adequately \nsupport a family of six, some of whom were attending college. He worked in \n                                                          \n5 I marked the pleading \u201cAdministrative Notice\u201d as GX 7, post hearing for purposes \nof clarity.  \n \n6 Response, supra n. 4. \n \n7 GX. 1, supra n. 1, is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise \nstated.  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n4\nthe construction field for the next several years, during which time he \nexperienced periods of unemployment. In 2003, he obtained his current position \nwith a federal contractor. From February 2006 until June 2007, he worked as a \nbilingual/bicultural advisor and engineering consultant to the U.S. Army in the \nGreen Zone in Iraq. (Tr. 37; 57). He held an interim top secret clearance while \nthere. Before assuming that position, he had not returned to Iraq since leaving \nin 1991. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, now deceased, were resident citizens of Iraq. They \nhad four daughters and one son. One of his sisters is deceased. One of his \nsisters lives in Australia. Two sisters remain citizen residents of Iraq and are \nmarried to Iraqi citizens with whom they have children. One of those sisters is \ncurrently visiting her son and family in the United States. He has visited his \nsister weekly since she arrived in the United States. Otherwise, he normally \nspeaks to his sisters and family members about six to seven times a year, \naround the holidays. (Tr. 60-61). He did not see any of his relatives while he \nwas stationed in Iraq from 2006 to 2007. None of his Iraqi family knows where \nhe works or what type of work he does. (Tr. 62). All of his family members are \nChristians and subject to persecution by the radical Islamic factions in Iraq. \n(Tr. 66). One of his brother-in-laws recently left his home because of the threat \nof violence. (Tr. 63). Both of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are deceased. They \nwere Iraqi citizens. (GX 1 at 5). \n \nApplicant submitted four exhibits attesting to his capabilities and \ncontribution to the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in rebuilding Iraq. In May 2006, \na major in the U.S. Army wrote that Applicant \u201cis continually trying to make \nIraq a better and safer place. He is a critical asset to the success of the Iraq \nmission and has performed in an outstanding manner whenever called on.\u201d (AX \nG). Another major wrote that Applicant was an invaluable member of the \nproject, who enhanced the battalion\u2019s abilities in working on a site project. (AX \nH). In a May 2007 evaluation, his commander rated him as exceeding all \nrequirements and referred to his work as \u201cexceptional.\u201d (AX I). Applicant \nreceived a commendation from the captain of his team for outstanding work \nduring his assistance to the Coalition Forces from April 2006 to April 2007. \n(AX F).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s name is on the title to one of his sisters\u2019 home in Iraq. She \nand her family live there, but she was unable to legally purchase it because of a \nresidency law implemented by Saddam Hussein. Applicant does not believe he \nwould ever inherit it or receive any money in the event it was sold. He hopes \nhis sister will be able to take sole title of it under the new Iraqi government. He \nhas never visited the home. (Tr. 36; GX 3 at 5).  \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride at being a U.S. citizen \nat his hearing and in his response to the SOR. \u201cI am now a US Citizen. I am \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n5\nwilling to renounce the Iraqi Citizenship. I am very proud to be a US Citizen.\u201d \n(GX 2 at 6).  \n \nIn addition to raising security concerns regarding foreign influence, the \nGovernment alleged in Paragraph 2 (\u00b6\u00b6 2. a through 2.g) of the SOR that \nApplicant owed seven delinquent debts, totaling $20,662. According to credit \nreports, the debts began accruing in 2002 and spanned into January 2006. (GX \n4, 5 and 6). Applicant admitted that the debts were his, but asserted some of \nthem were paid. The status of the debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nDebt \nStatus \n2.a \n$542 \nPaid 5/2007 \u2013 AX O; Tr. 40 \n2.b \n$1,297 \nPaid 4/2007 \u2013 AX C & D; Tr. 41-42 \n2.c \n$2,282 \nPaid 4/2007 \u2013 AX C & D \n2.d \n$11,201 \nPaid 8/2007 \u2013 AX A & B8  \n2.e \n$2,320 (same as 2.g) \nNegotiated \nsettlement \nin \nJuly \n2006\u2013AX \nE; \nTr. \n46-47 \nstatus \nunknown  \n2.f \n$1,729 \nPaying monthly \u2013 AX N:9  Tr. 47 \n2.g \n$2,320 (same as 2.e) \nAX E10 \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt arose during the years while he was \neither unemployed or under-employed and did not have sufficient income to \nmanage his bills. He believes other debts may have become due while he was \nrecently out of state or in Iraq and his wife did not pay them promptly. (Tr. 83-\n38). He paid four of the above debts. Two of the remaining debts are duplicates \nfor which he documented a previously proposed settlement offer. He is paying \nthe medical debt at $200 per month per his repayment plan.  \n \nIn his current position, Applicant earns $164,000 annually, leaving him \napproximately $8,000 net per month, which is enough money to support his \nfamily and pay his bills. He has been on leave from his position for the past two \nmonths, taking some time off for personal reasons. He intended to return to \nwork in October 2007. (Tr. 68-70). Although he has never worked with \nclassified information, his employer would like him to obtain a permanent \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 38). \n \nIraq \n \nIn 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein \nfrom power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. \n                                                          \n8 This debt is noted on GX 6 at 8. \n \n9 This is a medical bill for Applicant\u2019s son that he initially disputed due to malpractice claims.  \n \n10 See GX 6 at 9 for confirmation that these two allegations concern the same account. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n6\nDespite the elections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence, \nperpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and \nkidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors and other \ncivilians, as well as Iraqis. Despite aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.     \n \n \nPOLICIES \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative \njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nFor Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used \nto determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommon sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny \nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an \nadministrative judge considers all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 \n2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, \nan \nadministrative \njudge \nshould \nconsider \nthe \nnine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \n \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the \nstandard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. \nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n7\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d 11 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to \nestablish a case, which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is \nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an \napplicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto present \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and \n[Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).12 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and \nconfidence. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures \nthroughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. \nDecisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Executive \nOrder 10865, \u00a7 7 states that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an \napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest, and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of \nall appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described \n                                                          \n11 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept \nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is \nsomething less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two \ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being \nsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 \n(1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See \nv. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n12 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both \nfavorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of \npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden \nof persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, \n2006).  \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n8\nbriefly above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth \nin the SOR: \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains that security concerns may arise from foreign contacts \nand interests \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial \ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under \n[AG B] can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the \nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk \nof terrorism.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in \na foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion; and, \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if \nonly one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with \nthat relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n Applicant has consistent contacts with his two sisters, who are resident \ncitizens of Iraq. His sisters and their families are Christian and encounter \nperiodic persecution by Islamic extremists. This close relationship with the two \nfamilies creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation \nbecause terrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence and are hostile to United \nStates\u2019 interests.  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n9\n  \nThe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthese \ntwo \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence and prove mitigation. Three Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or \nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply because Applicant\u2019s relationships with \nhis sisters are of sufficient magnitude to negate these two mitigating conditions. \nHis contacts with family members in Iraq are consistent, and he has been \nroutinely visiting his sister, who is in the United States. There is a risk that he \ncould be placed in a position of having to choose between his sisters and the \ninterests of the United States, given the nature and extent of religious \npersecution his family encounters in Iraq.  \n \nApplicant established a limited application of AG \u00b6 8(b). He has a sense \nof pride and loyalty to the United States. He has lived in the United States with \nhis immediate family since 1991. They became U.S. citizens in 2003. He did \nnot return to Iraq until 2006 when he worked for the U.S. Army. He has worked \nhere for the past 16 years and educated his children in the United States. In \ncontrast, his Iraqi interests have become more minimal over the years. Although \nhis name is on the title to his sister\u2019s property, he asserts no ownership nor has \nhe visited it. His contacts with his two sisters in Iraq are primarily to discuss \nfamily issues several times a year.  While he was in Iraq from 2006 to 2007, he \ndid not have any contact with his family. There is some likelihood that he can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n10\nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial \nproblems: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \n \nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions could raise a \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(a) and (c). Applicant admitted that he had insufficient \nfunds to meet his debts for a period of time. According to credit reports, he has \na history of failing to meet those obligations up to 2006. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of these two \ndisqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence of \nmitigation. Three Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors \nor otherwise resolve debts. \n \nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude all \nthree mitigating conditions apply. Some of Applicant\u2019s financial troubles arose \nduring earlier periods of unemployment and under-employment. More recently, \nhis wife failed to pay some of their bills. Both facts establish the first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b). As there is no evidence regarding the financial steps he took to \nmanage his debts during those times, the application of the mitigation condition \nis limited.  \n \n Applicant has paid four of the seven debts. He is on a payment plan for a \nmedical bill he previously disputed, arising from his assertion of medical \nmalpractice. He represented that he previously negotiated a settlement of \n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n11\nanother debt, although there is no evidence that he made a final payment on it. \nBecause the adjudicative guidelines do not require one to have paid-off every \ndebt in full, his good-faith efforts over the past few years, coupled with his \ncurrent salary, are sufficient to establish that the matters are being resolved and \nunder control, as required by AG \u00b6 20 (c) and (d). \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \n\u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not \nconsider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal \nmanner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by \nconsidering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d13 The \ndirective lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF), which are used for \n\u201cwhole person\u201d analysis and are applicable to financial considerations. \nHowever, as foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of \nparticipation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d is the most relevant of \nthe nine APFs to this adjudication. 14 In addition to the eighth APF, other \n\u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \nUltimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d       \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence \nof an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s \nfamily\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or \nher social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given \ncase.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nConsiderable mitigating evidence weighs towards granting Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. Applicant is a mature person. He has lived in the United \nStates for 16 years, and he has been a naturalized citizen for four years. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and children have been living in the United States for the \nsame number of years and are naturalized citizens. He did not return to Iraq for \n15 years, until his job supporting U.S. forces took him back. While working \nthere from 2006 to 2007, he did not contact any of his family members. There is \nno evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the \n                                                          \n13 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting ISCR Case No. 02-\n01093 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)); ISCR Case No. 05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, \n2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate events \nmay have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation). \n \n14 See ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis \nunder the eighth APF apparently without discussion of the other APFs was sustainable); ISCR \nCase No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (sole APF mentioned is eighth APF); ISCR \nCase No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because \nJudge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential for exploitation\u201d), but see ISCR Case No. 04-\n00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that eighth APF is exclusive \ncircumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \nDeleted: paid \nDeleted: es not\n\n \n                                                                                                                                         \n \n12\nUnited States. He takes his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he \nhas worked diligently for a defense contractor for several years in an important \ncapacity for the U.S. Army. His supervisors assess him as loyal, trustworthy, \nconscientious, and responsible. He is a good family member, employee and U.S. \ncitizen. No witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance. There is \nnot any derogatory criminal information about him in the record. His ties to the \nUnited States appear to be stronger than his ties to his sisters and their families \nin Iraq. He has taken steps to resolve his financial problems and is committed to \nmanaging his debts. \n \n \nHowever, three circumstances weigh heavily against Applicant in the \nwhole person analysis pertinent to Foreign Influence.  First, there is a \nsignificant risk of terrorism and human rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly \nfor security purposes, terrorists are hostile to the United States and actively \nseek classified information. Terrorists, or other forces operating in Iraq, may \nattempt to use his sisters or their families who live there to obtain such \ninformation. Second, he had significant connections to Iraq before he \nimmigrated to the United States in 1991. He was born in Iraq and spent his \nformative years there. He obtained his education from an Iraqi university and \nworked there as a civil engineer for a period of time. Third, and most \nsignificant, his family is under the constant threat of religious persecution, as \nnoted by his testimony that his brother-in-law recently was forced to leave his \nhome.  \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is \nraised . . . it is deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling \ninterest in security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns pertaining to \nfinancial considerations, but not those related to foreign influence. The \nevidence leaves me with some doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and \nsuitability.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person \nfactors\u201d15 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under \nthe Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude that Applicant is not eligible for \naccess to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n15See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

He had a series of financial problems that arose in 1999-2000. He\naccumulated over $100,000 of delinquent debts that remain unpaid. He decided to stop paying some\nof his debts. He intentionally failed to list, on his security clearance application, that he had any debts\nin the past seven years that were over 180 days delinquent. Applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline E, personal conduct, and\nGuideline J, criminal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 1, 2006,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 29, 2006, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 18, 2007.\nWith the consent of the parties, I convened a hearing on March 20, 2007, to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to reflect the correct dollar amount in \u00b6 1.l. There\nbeing no objection, the amount was changed to reflect $8,230. The Government offered three\nexhibits that were marked as GE 1-3 and admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his\nbehalf, had one witness testify, and offered twelve exhibits that were marked as AE A-L and were\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 63 years old and the chief financial officer and partner, along with two other\npartners for a business with approximately 27-30 employees. The three partners have been in\nbusiness together since 1987. The business contracts with commercial entities and the federal\ngovernment as resellers of high technology. Applicant and his partners hold top secret clearances.\nApplicant has held his clearance since approximately 1997. Applicant is responsible for the\naccounting and financial aspects of the business, including producing monthly and annual financial\nstatements, liasioning with banks to obtain and repay loans, and initiating large lines of credit with\n\nAE A Affidavit from partner, sworn.\n1\nId.\n2\nTr. 68. \n3\nTr. 66-81.\n4\nAE F.\n5\nTr. 79-85; AE E and G. I have not considered Applicant\u2019s debt to the IRS for disqualifying purposes, but have\n6\nconsidered it when analyzing the whole person.\n3\nbanks to maintain the company\u2019s buying ability.  He is considered by his partners to be an expert in\n1\nfinances and handles his responsibilities in an honest and trustworthy manner and is accountable for\nall of the business\u2019 finances. His partners believe he has a keen sense of attention to detail and his\nhandling of the company\u2019s finances is beyond reproach.2\nIn May 1998 Applicant married. His wife had two daughters from a previous marriage.\nApplicant owned a home at the time, but purchased a different one so his stepdaughters could\ncontinue to attend the same school they had previously. He leased his original home (House C) and\nlived in House (T) with his family. Due to his wife\u2019s mental problems the marriage ended in\nSeptember 1999. Applicant was ordered to support his ex-wife until the end of 1999, and allow her\nto remain in House T until then. As an act of benevolence he continued to provide her support until\nsometime in 2001. This included paying for living expenses, a car, and tuition for the stepdaughters\u2019\neducation. 3\nSometime in 1998 Applicant acquired stock from another company in an exchange for other\nstocks. He took the stock and deposited it in two different brokerage firms. There was a waiting\nperiod before he could sell the stock. He used the stock as collateral on two margin loans. One\nmargin loan was for $150,000 based on the value of the stock at $416,917. The second margin loan\nwas for $300,000, based on stock value of approximately $780,000. A margin loan carries significant\nrisk in the event the stock falls below a certain value. The stock market is unpredictable. It is\ncommonly understood that the greater the risks, the greater the potential, but not guaranteed,\nrewards. Applicant assumed this risk when he secured a margin loan. Although Applicant believed\nit was unlikely that the stock would fall below margin, it was not totally unforeseeable. It was merely\na risk he was willing to take because of the greater rewards. Unfortunately for Applicant, the stock\nfell below a predetermined threshold and there was a margin call. It resulted in the stock being sold\nand it created a tax liability of more than approximately $100,000 for Applicant.  In addition, when\n4\nApplicant borrowed $450,000 on margin, he took the money and lent it to a business acquaintance\nbecause he believed he could yield a higher interest rate. The loan was unsecured and had no\ncollateral. Applicant believed he could make more money with the loan. The acquaintance\nsubsequently went bankrupt and Applicant lost the $450,000.  \n5\nApplicant worked out a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service to pay the tax debt.\nHe refinanced his two houses and since tax years 1999 and 2000, he has been consistently repaying\nhis tax debts and has approximately $9,000 remaining to be paid for penalties and interest.  \n6\n\nTr. 88-98; AE K.\n7\nAE I; These are the amounts that Applicant lists as his \u201cactual\u201d income. He lists his total income for 1999 as\n8\n$272,771; 2000 as $299,595; 2001 as $52,837; 2002 as $50,178; 2003 as $109.990; 2004 as $224,963; 2005 $360,608.\nTr. 98.\n9\nTr. 98.\n10\nTr. 98. \n11\nTr. 99; AE J.\n12\nTr. 174.\n13\n4\nApplicant continued to own two houses until December 2006, when he sold one of his\nhouses. He lived in House C beginning in 2000. He had attempted to sell House C in 2003 and again\nin 2005, but it was in need of repair and the housing market was in a downturn, so he was unable to\nsell the house. He did repairs on the house and it eventually sold in December 2006. Applicant paid\nmore than $16,000 to close on the house.  The monthly mortgage payments on the two houses were\n7\napproximately $6,000.\nApplicant and his business partners decided to pursue a new business venture in 2001. The\nventure did not prove to be profitable and the partners\u2019 income dropped. In 1999, Applicant listed\nhis adjusted income as $185,000. It dropped to $68,000 in 2000; $43,000 in 2001; $40,000 in 2002;\nand then started to rise to $81,000 in 2003; $187,000 in 2004; and $325,000 in 2005.  When\n8\nApplicant\u2019s income went down he began using credit cards to maintain his expenses.  He claimed\n9\nhe could not afford his expenses because of the decrease in his salary.  The delinquent credit cards\n10\nand other debts listed in the SOR are in excess of $104,000. Applicant disputes some of the amounts.\nApplicant contacted some of the credit card companies in 1999 to negotiate lower payments\nand they refused.  Applicant contracted with a credit consolidation service in October 2003 to work\n11\nout a monthly repayment payment.  He was to pay $1,357 a month and it would be disbursed to\n12\nseven creditors. He made four to six payments and then stopped because he stated he could not\nafford the payments.  He continued to pay the mortgages on the two homes he owned. He spoke\n13\nwith a bankruptcy attorney in approximately 2002-2003, who advised him not to file bankruptcy.\nApplicant stated the attorney advised him to not pay the credit cards with the highest balances. Some\nof the delinquent credit card debts that Applicant owes have been charged off by the creditors. Some\nof the debts were referred to collection agencies. In addition, Applicant stated he maintains other\ncredit cards that are not delinquent and pays them regularly. \nApplicant assumed financial responsibility for his girlfriend in 2001. He pays $400 a month\non a lease for a car for her. He pays for her gas, groceries, cell phone, insurance and all living\nexpenses. She contributes $1,000 annually to the household and expends $1,000 in supplies for her\nart business. In addition, he has spent approximately $50,000 over two to three years to repair House\n\nTr. 176.\n14\nTr. 175.\n15\nTr. 134-137.\n16\nTr. 138.\n17\nTr. 137-138.\n18\nTr, 139.\n19\nTr. 140; GE 2 at 2.\n20\nTr. 10; GE 3 p 11.\n21\nTr. 143; GE 3 p. 4.\n22\nId.\n23\nTr. 143.\n24\n5\nC.  He has approximately $30,000 in savings he is holding in reserve to pay his taxes.  He also has\n14\n15\napproximately $70,000 in a 401k plan. He estimated his monthly expenses are approximately $5,000.\nApplicant admits he owes the credit card debt in SOR 1.a, but disputes the amount, believing\nhe owes $22,099. The debt was charged off and Applicant has not paid it. He stated he is not paying\nthis debt because of insufficient funds.16\nThe debt in SOR 1. b is a credit card debt referred to collection November 2003. He believes\nthis debt is a duplication of 1. i. He has made no effort to repay it.  \n17\nThe debts in SOR 1. c and 1.d are both credit card debts that Applicant has elected not to\npay.  SOR 1.d is a $256 delinquent debt referred to a collection agency that remains unpaid.\n18\nApplicant has not contacted the creditor to inquire about information concerning the debt or resolve\nit.  \n19\nSOR 1.f is a medical debt of $364. Applicant denies the debt because he has no information\nas to the identity of the creditor. He has not taken any action to find out who the creditor is and if it\nis a legitimate debt.  SOR debt 1.g is another debt that Applicant does not recognize, but has made\n20\nno attempt to contact the creditor and resolve it.  This account was opened in April 2004. \n21\nSOR debt 1.h is a debt for $60 and the creditor has a local address.  Applicant stated he did\n22\nnot recognize the creditor and has not made contact to resolve it.  This debt was referred to\n23\ncollection in April 2004. SOR debt 1.i is a credit card debt charged off in May 2004 for $17,064.\nApplicant stated he believed it is the same debt as SOR 1. b. He did not provide specific verification\nto support his claim and has not done anything to pay the debt or contest its duplication.  \n24\n\nGE 3 at 3.\n25\nTr. 144.\n26\nGE 3 p.2.\n27\nTr. 145.\n28\nTr. 145.\n29\nTr. 146-147.\n30\nGE 2; Tr. 147.\n31\nTr. 147-149.\n32\nTr. 172.\n33\nTr. 142.\n34\nTr. 170\n35\n6\nSOR debt 1. j is a debt for $400 to a local creditor.

It was sent to collection in June 2004.\n26\nSOR debt 1. k is for $425 for an account referred for collection in July 2004.  Applicant stated he\n27\ndoes not know who the creditor is and has done nothing to research or resolve the debt.  \n28\nApplicant denies the debt in SOR 1.l because he cannot recall the account. It is a credit card\ndebt for $8,230 that was charged off in August 2004.  Applicant admits the debt in SOR 1.m. It is\n29\na credit card debt for $10,224 that was sent to collection in October 2004. He has not contacted the\ncreditor or done anything to resolve the debt.  \n30\nApplicant does not know the medical creditor in SOR 1.n. He did not recall if he received\nmedical services. The amount owed is $175. Applicant has not paid it or attempted to resolve it.31\nThe debt in SOR 1.o is for satellite television service. Applicant contracted with the service\nthrough a promotional offer. He later canceled the service and disputed the amount of $390 owed.32\nHe has not paid or resolved the debt. \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts owed in SOR 1.a-1.o. Some of the debts are charged\noff and some remain in a collection status. Applicant stated he has not spent the time to find out what\nthe debts were incurred for.  Applicant has not contacted any of the creditors on the SOR since 1999\n33\nwhen he attempted to negotiate lower payment options with certain creditors.  He stated he intended\n34\nto contact the creditors and work out payment plans, but has not done anything yet.35\nApplicant completed and swore to his security clearance application renewal on January 12,\n2005. Question 38 asked: Your Financial Delinquencies-180 Days, In the last 7 years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?

Dec. 19, 2002).\n44\n7\n180 days was because \u201cI had talked to counsel, and they indicated that anything that had been\ndismissed was not considered past due.\u201d  He interpreted \u201cdismissed\u201d to mean \u201cwritten off\u201d or\n36\n\u201ccharged off.\u201d  Applicant stated he had sought this attorney\u2019s advice regarding filing bankruptcy\n37\nin 2002-2003. When asked if the attorney had told him that he did not have to list any of his debts\non his security clearance application or if Applicant discussed his responses to his security clearance\napplication with him, Applicant\u2019s response was, \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t talk specifically about this.\u201d  He\n38\nfurther stated, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in regard to the security clearance. It was just in general with creditors.\u201d He\nfurther stated: \u201cWe didn\u2019t talk about [the] security application. I just asked him if a debt had been\ncharged off, was it considered past due.\u201d Applicant never sought advice on how to answer questions\non his security clearance application.  He stated he made a mistake in not putting his debts on his\n39\nsecurity clearance application. Applicant did not write any explanation or clarification in Question\n43, which asks: General Remarks-Do you have any additional remarks to enter in y our application?\nHe did not notify the government that he failed to list his delinquencies prior to being confronted by\na government investigator.  Based on the entire record of evidence, testimony and observation, I\n40\nfind Applicant was not credible and he deliberately and intentionally failed to list his delinquent\ndebts. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n41\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n42\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n43\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n44\n\nId.\n45\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n46\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n47\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n48\n8\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n45\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n46\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n47\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.48\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n9\nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19 (a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19 (c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has more than $104,000 in delinquent credit cards and\nother debts that he has not paid. He made a decision that he would not pay his large credit card debts.\nThe debts are charged off or in collection. He admits he owes most of the debts and has not made\npayments on the debts. Those debts that he stated he was unaware of, whom the creditor was, or\nwhat the debt was incurred for, he has not taken action to contact or research the debt to resolve it.\nMany of his debts date back to 1999 through 2005. For a period of time Applicant may have been\nunable to pay some of his debts, but based on all of the facts he is also unwilling to pay his debts and\nhas established a history of financial delinquency. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20 (b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), FC MC 20 (d) (the individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts), FC MC 20 (e) (the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue).\nApplicant\u2019s many delinquent debts are recent because they remain unpaid. Applicant went\nthrough a period of financial crisis. He took out two large margin loans. The loans involved risk.\nWhen the stocks went below margin and were sold, he had a significant tax liability. He lent a large\namount of money without any collateral in an unsecured loan. Both actions were risky financial\ndecisions made by Applicant, who is an astute businessman with a great deal of experience, as the\nchief financial officer of a business. Although he had hoped to make money from his decisions, he\ndid not. Applicant did not have control over the financial markets and the acquaintance who\ndefaulted on a large loan, but he did have control over the risk he was willing to take to reap greater\nrewards. Applicant did not have control over his divorce that caused additional financial problems.\nHe also did not have total control over the decision he and his partners made to pursue additional\n\n10\nopportunities that then failed and reduced his income for a period of time. Applicant did have control\nover how he handled his personal finances during his financial problems. He made certain financial\nchoices in what to do about the two houses he owned. Because the housing market was weak, he kept\nboth houses and continued to make the payments on them. However, he decided to live off of credit\ncards during this period. He failed to pay those credit cards listed in the SOR. His salary has\nincreased steadily since 2004, but he has not made an attempt to pay back the creditors in the SOR,\ndespite acknowledging he owes most of the debts. I find the debts are recent and unresolved and that\nhis lack of action to repay his creditors cast doubt about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nTherefore FC MC 20 (a) does not apply. \nI have considered all of the financial issues that occurred that affected Applicant, including\nall of those mentioned in the findings of fact and conclusions. I find that some of the conditions that\nresulted in Applicant\u2019s financial turmoil were beyond his control. I also find he did act responsibly\nin setting up a payment plan for his tax liability and helping his ex-wife. I find he did not act\nirresponsibly in his business\u2019 decision to expand in a market that did not prove profitable. However,\nI also find he did not act responsibly by living off of numerous credit cards and not making an effort\nto repay them. He deliberately chose to not pay his credit cards and other bills that continue to\nremain delinquent. He continues to maintain other credit cards, but has not made an effort to resolve\nthose debts listed on the SOR. He does not dispute most of them, but has not paid them. His salary\nis at a level that he could make some payments. He pays for a car, insurance, subsistence and other\nliving expenses that are not reimbursed for his friend, but is unwilling to pay even the smallest of\nthe debts listed in the SOR. Therefore I find FC MC 20 (b) does not apply.\nApplicant sought bankruptcy advice and started a credit repayment program, but failed to\ncontinue the monthly payment plan. He has not made a good faith effort to repay his creditors nor\nis there clear indications that the problem is being resolved. Applicant\u2019s finances have improved, and\nalthough he claimed he intended to resolve his debts, he has not shown a clear indication or action\nto do so. I find FC MC 20 (c) and (d) do not apply.\nApplicant disputes the amount of certain debts listed in the SOR and denies others. However,\nhe has not substantiated his claims. In 1999 he contacted some of the creditors to see if he could\nnegotiate lower payments. This was not a satisfactory plan to the creditors and since then Applicant\nhas not attempted any other resolution. I find FC MC 20 (e) does not apply. \nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. Applicant intentionally failed to list\nhe had delinquent debts over 180 days on his security clearance application. Applicant had been\ngoing through a severe financial crisis since 1999. He admitted he was living off of credit cards. He\nis familiar with the security clearance application and its purpose. Although he stated he spoke to\na bankruptcy attorney about listing charged off debts as it pertained to bankruptcy, it is simply not\ncredible that he believed he did not have to divulge any of his financial problems on his security\nclearance application. Some of Applicant\u2019s debts were not charged off, but were in collection.\nApplicant is an astute savvy businessman with years of financial experience. The question is quite\nclear: \u201cIn the last 7 years have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant\u2019s\n\nISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 WL 32114535 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002). \n49\n11\nexplanation for not listing his debts is simply not believable. Information is material if it would affect\na final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an\napplicant\u2019s background.  An applicant\u2019s financial history is a matter that could affect a final agency\n49\ndecision on whether to grant the applicant a clearance, and an applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the\ninformation would impede a thorough investigation of his background. At the time he completed the\nsecurity clearance application  Applicant was aware of his delinquent debts and that he was required\nto list them, yet he deliberately failed to do so. Hence, the above disqualifying condition applies.\nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17 (a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17 (e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation\nor duress). There is no evidence to support any effort by Applicant to correct the falsifications before\nbeing confronted with the facts. Applicant\u2019s answers on his application regarding his debts were\ndeliberate falsifications with the intent to mislead. Applicant has not provided any information of\npositive steps he has taken to reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I find\nPC MC 17 (a) and (e) do not apply.\nBased on all the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) (a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31 (b) (allegations or admissions of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted),\napply. Applicant intentionally and deliberately lied on his security clearance application, a felony\nviolation under Title 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) 32 (a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and CC MC 32 (d)\n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement). Applicant\u2019s falsification of his\nsecurity clearance application casts doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.\nHis falsifications on an application to consider his trustworthiness to protect our nation\u2019s secrets are\ntroubling. He had an opportunity to reflect on his falsifications before being interviewed and come\nforward to correct them, but he did not. His actions cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and\ngood judgment. I find there is insufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. Therefore, I find CC\nMC 32 (a) and (d) do not apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\n\n12\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. I reviewed and considered the documentary evidence.\nI also considered Applicant\u2019s extensive financial experience and background, and ability to make\nimportant decisions. Applicant had a series of financial crises occur that were unfortunate. Some\nwere because of risks he assumed and some he did not have control over. However, Applicant also\nmade choices regarding his finances and living expenses. He knew of his financial problems and\ndiscussed them in great detail, but he also knew he was responsible for divulging them on his\nsecurity clearance application and intentionally did not. His explanation for why he did not was not\nbelievable. He has made no effort to repay the debts listed in the SOR. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns\nbased on his financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:-1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

She has been steadily employed since 1998. She has two children. Applicant has\neleven delinquent debts totaling approximately $8,000 that remain unpaid.

Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 28,\n2006, detailing the basis for its preliminary decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations). This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan.\n2. 1992), as amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).\nIn Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR, she elected to have her case decided on the written\nrecord. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on\nFebruary 28, 2007. The FORM was mailed on March 1, 2007, and received on March 9, 2007.\nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not provide any additional information. The case was\nassigned to me on May 24, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 46 years old and has been employed as a custodian for a federal contractor since\nNovember 2004.

Applicant stated she is unable to pay this debt \u201cat this time.\u201d3\nApplicant did not provide any amplifying information as to what action she intends to take to pay\nit in the future or resolve it otherwise. Applicant also stated she had been receiving some child\nsupport payments for her children from their father and then it abruptly stopped.  She failed to\n4\nprovide any other amplifying information about the ages of her children and what efforts she has\ntaken, if any, to pursue child support payments.\nApplicant did not provide any information to show she is attempting to resolve any of the\ndebts listed in the SOR. She did not provide any information as to why the debts were incurred and\nwhy they are delinquent. She has eleven delinquent debts. Ten debts are in a collection status and\none debt was charged off in July 2005. The oldest debt was placed for collection in December 2002\nand the most recent was placed for collection in June 2006. No information was provided as to\nApplicant\u2019s income status or if she has received any financial counseling. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n5\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee\n6\nto grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n7\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n8\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n9\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n10\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n11\n\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n12\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n13\nSee v. Washington Metro.

An applicant \u201chas\n16\nthe ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue his security clearance.\u201d  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\n17\non the side of denial.\u201d18\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations are a security concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\n\n5\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has many debts that have been delinquent for years with\nno action toward resolving them and no information or indication that she intends on paying them.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant\u2019s debts are\nrecent and unpaid and she failed to provide any information as to her intent to resolve them. The lack\nof information on any good-faith effort to repay or take action on the debts and the age of the debts\ncasts doubt on her reliability and good judgment. Applicant alluded to a period of unemployment;\nhowever, this contradicted her SCA where she listed she had been steadily employed since 1998. She\nalso stated she had been receiving child support, but it stopped. She did not provide enough\ninformation to show she took any action to pursue reinstatement of the payments. Applicant was\nemployed when her debts became delinquent. She has not shown the conditions that may have\ncaused her financial problems were beyond her control, or that she has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. Applicant has not provided any evidence that she intends to pay her delinquent debts\nor has made a good-faith effort to resolve them. Therefore, I find none of the above mitigating\nconditions apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n6\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered all of the information\nprovided in Applicant\u2019s answer and the attached documents.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a native of the Republic of China (Taiwan), acquired U.S. citizenship in October\n1991 after living in the U.S. since September 1981. He left his spouse and child in the U.S. and\nmoved to Taiwan to assist his father in obtaining medical care from April 1998 to July 2004. While\nin Taiwan, Applicant was employed with a nonprofit research institute and then a commercial\ncomputer company. Applicant renewed his Taiwanese passport in 2001 and used it for convenience\nwhen traveling between the U.S. and Taiwan. The foreign preference concerns are mitigated by his\nrenunciation of Taiwanese citizenship and surrender of the foreign passport, but foreign influence\nconcerns persist because of his close relationship with family members in Taiwan, including sisters\nemployed by Taiwan\u2019s tax office. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nSOR \u00b6 1.a was amended at the hearing to correctly indicate that Taiwan is the Republic of China and not the\n1\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China.\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated April 2007 (I), Background Note: China, dated August 2007 (VIII),\n2\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007 (XI), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated March 19, 2007 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n3\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (VII). The document was prepared for the\n4\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on July 31, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign influence)  and\n1\nGuideline C (foreign preference) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on\nAugust 15, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on October 2, 2007, and I convened a hearing on November 6,\n2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) were admitted and Applicant\ntestified. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on November 16, 2007.\nThe record was held open until November 13, 2007, for Applicant to submit evidence of his\nU.S. income tax filings, his home ownership in the U.S., his father\u2019s illness, and his financial support\nfor his spouse and son. By facsimile on November 9, 2007, Applicant timely submitted six proposed\nexhibits (A-F). On November 16, 2007, Department Counsel indicated the government did not object\nto their admission. The documents were marked and entered into evidence.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn September 26, 2007,  the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nfacts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Applicant filed a response to\nthe government\u2019s request on October 5, 2007, objecting to the government\u2019s referring  to the PRC\nas China, to my taking administrative notice of \u201ccertain statements characterized as facts,\u201d including\nthat Taiwan \u201chas significant economic contacts with China,\u201d and to my considering certain\npublications (especially concerning the PRC) he submits are not relevant. Applicant also submitted\nalternative facts for administrative notice. The government relied on publications of the Department\nof State;  the Congressional Research Service;  the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security\n2\n3\nStudies;  the National Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of the National\n4\n\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (III) and\n5\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (X). \nSee 2006 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, excerpts dated\n6\nNovember 2006 (IX).\nThe press releases (IV) and (V) were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan actively pursues\n7\ncollection of U.S. economic and propriety information.  Neither case involves Applicant personally. The April 18, 2006,\npress release (IV) concerns the sentencing of a U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft between December\n1999 and December 2001 to the benefit of a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no evidence of that Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment was involved in, or sanctioned the criminal activity. The January 22, 2007 (V) press release concerns the\nsentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for, in part, making false statements to the government concerning\nhis relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer and by not reporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where\nhe met with the foreign intelligence officer. \nSee U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005 (VI). The\n8\ncourt records do not pertain to any criminal charge against Applicant.\nThe criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is relevant only to the extent it impacts the assessment of the\n9\nlikelihood of improper foreign influence to acquire U.S. classified or sensitive information. Historical and political\nrealities justify treating Taiwan and the PRC as separate entities, despite the fact that the U.S. is committed diplomatically\nto a one-China policy. The PRC\u2019s internal situation (e.g., human rights abuses, visitor surveillance, travel restrictions)\nis of limited relevance in the absence of any allegation that Applicant has some personal connection to the PRC.\n3\nCounterintelligence Executive;  and the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission;\n5\n6\ntwo press releases reportedly from the U.S. Department of Justice;  and records of the U.S. District\n7\nCourt for the Eastern District of Virginia.  Applicant relied on a report of the House Permanent\n8\nSelect Committee on Intelligence (104  Congress), dated June 23, 1997, and an article from U.S.\nth\nNews and World Report, posted on the web January 19, 2003, and in print edition January 27, 2003,\nto confirm the espionage activities of two U.S. citizens during their U.S. government employments.\nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and\nmateriality of the facts proposed by the parties, I notified the parties by Order of October 15, 2007,\nthat I was taking administrative notice of the following facts.9\nThe government of Taiwan is a multiparty democracy. The United States recognizes that\nthere is only one China, that the government of the PRC is the sole legal government of China, and\nthat Taiwan is part of China. Under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial\nrelations with Taiwan. Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to\nsell appropriate military defensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s\nmost important trading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose primary\nmission is the defense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has\nnot renounced the use of force against Taiwan. It is U.S. policy that the resolutions of disputes\nbetween Taiwan and China be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power and a member\nof the World Trade Organization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the U.S., and ready access\nto U.S. markets. The U.S. State Department reports that Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve\nrespect for human rights and create a democratic political system since ending martial law. In the\npast, organizations in Taiwan employed unlawful methods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence\ninformation.  As recently as 2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert\nrelationship with a U.S. State Department official.\n\n4\nEvidence adduced at the hearing did not warrant administrative notice of additional facts. No\ninformation was developed that tied Applicant personally to the PRC.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged foreign influence concerns because of the Taiwanese residency and\ncitizenship of Applicant\u2019s mother, father, two brothers, three sisters, parents-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.a), the\ndual citizenship (Taiwan and U.S.) of his spouse (\u00b61.b), the employment of two of his sisters for\nTaiwan\u2019s tax agency (\u00b61.c), his father-in-law being a retired career military officer (\u00b6 1.d), and his\ntravels to Taiwan in 1998 and yearly from 2002 to 2006 (\u00b6 1.e). Under foreign preference, Applicant\nwas alleged to have used his Taiwanese passport in preference to his U.S. passport on travel to\nTaiwan from 2002 to 2005 (\u00b6 2.a), and to have resided and worked in Taiwan for a research institute\nfrom about April 1998 to June 2001 (\u00b6 2.b) and for a computer company from July 2001 to July 2004\n(\u00b6 2.c).\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the citizenship and residency of his family\nmembers as alleged (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b), the employment of his sisters for the functional equivalent of the\nInternal Revenue Service in Taiwan (\u00b6 1.c), and that his father-in-law retired from Taiwan\u2019s army\nin about 1961 (\u00b6 1.d). He admitted he had traveled to Taiwan in 1998, but while he traveled back and\nforth between the U.S. and Taiwan every year between 1998 and 2004, he spent most of his time in\nTaiwan. He indicated that business trips to Taiwan in 2004 and 2005 were for his U.S. employer, and\nadded that he had taken a personal trip in 2006 to visit family in Taiwan (\u00b6 1.e). Applicant denied\nany use of his Taiwanese passport in preference to his U.S. passport and averred that he traveled with\nboth passports in his possession (\u00b6 2.a). Applicant admitted his employment in Taiwan as he needed\nto support himself and his family in the U.S. while caring for his ill father in Taiwan (\u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c).\nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the\npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having taken administrative notice of certain facts (see infra),\nI make the following relevant and material additional findings.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old principal electrical engineer. He earned his master of science\ndegree in mechanical engineering in December 1982, his master\u2019s in electrical engineering in May\n1987, and his doctorate in electrical engineering in May 1994, all from the same public university\nin the U.S. He has been working for his present employer, a defense contractor, since October 2005\nand seeks a security clearance so that he can work on classified radar projects.\nApplicant was born in September 1954 in Taiwan. He is the oldest of six children (three\nmale, three female) born to Taiwanese resident citizens. His father, who was born in the PRC, was\na barber in Taiwan until he retired. His mother, a native of Taiwan, did not work outside of the\nhome. In about May 1975, Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree from a university in Taiwan. \nIn about August 1981, Applicant came to the U.S. on a student visa to pursue graduate study.\nHe wanted to see what life was like on the other side of the world. Applicant came to appreciate the\nrespect afforded him in the academic process (\u201c[professors] are willing to help you, not you ask a\nstupid question and then don\u2019t answer you. But in Taiwan, no, you don\u2019t do that because nobody is\n\nApplicant presented as Exhibit B a hospital appointment notice for his father at a medical clinic in the U.S.\n10\nThe appointment was scheduled for August 24, 1998. This is inconsistent with his testimony that he returned to Taiwan\nto care for his father in April 1998 and that his parents were in the U.S. in 1996 or 1997, unless his father traveled to the\nU.S. specifically for treatment in August. \n5\ngoing to answer you, nobody is going to appreciate your question or your curiosity. . . .\u201d Tr. 54). He\nbecame a lawful permanent resident in 1984.\nIn 1985, Applicant went to Taiwan to persuade his parents to purchase a home there. He gave\nthem $5,000 toward a down payment.  In October 1991, while pursuing his doctorate degree in the\nU.S., Applicant became a U.S. citizen, taking an oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support\nand defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or\ncivilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant took no action to formally renounce his\nTaiwanese citizenship.\nIn May 1994, Applicant was awarded his doctorate degree in electrical engineering. In May\n1995, he married a Taiwanese citizen in the U.S. He met her at a Buddhist temple in the U.S.  In\nmid-May 1996, Applicant was issued a U.S. passport. Applicant continued to maintain a Taiwanese\npassport so that he would not have to obtain a visa to enter Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s parents came to the\nU.S. and stayed for about six months, sometime between 1996 and 1998.\nIn January 1998, Applicant and his spouse had their only child, a son. In about April 1998,\nApplicant returned to Taiwan to help his father who had suffered a stroke. His assistance consisted\nprimarily of speaking with medical professionals, accompanying him to doctors\u2019 appointments and\nthe hospital for surgery, and conducting research into treatment for his father\u2019s condition.10\nOtherwise, he saw his parents on weekends. Applicant\u2019s spouse and infant child stayed in the U.S.\nHer mother came from Taiwan for several months to help her in about 1999. In April 2000,\nApplicant\u2019s spouse became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nApplicant stayed in Taiwan for six years, renting a succession of apartments located about\ntwo hours from his parents\u2019 home. Applicant traveled to the U.S. to see his spouse and son once a\nyear, usually at the New Year or Chinese New Year. Applicant stayed in the U.S. for two to three\nweeks each time. On his trips he took both his U.S. and Taiwanese passports, and on at least a couple\noccasions, presented both of them on entry and exit.  On May 1, 2001, he renewed his Taiwanese\npassport for another ten years, and this passport shows travel from Taiwan from February 1, 2002\nto February 19, 2002, January 29, 2003 to February 16, 2003, and February 3, 2004 to February 15,\n2004. While he was living in Taiwan, Applicant continued to file joint income tax returns with his\nspouse. She had the returns prepared by a professional and sent them to him. Applicant\u2019s foreign\nearned income was $19,002 in 1998, $29,401 in 1999 and 2000, $32,000 in 2001, $43,682 in 2002,\nand $51,180 in 2003. (Ex. A) \nTo support himself in Taiwan and his immediate family back in the U.S., Applicant was\nemployed from April 1998 to June 2001 as an engineer for a Taiwanese nonprofit research institute\nthat did work for commercial clients as well as the government. Applicant worked on cellular phone\nprojects. He gave his parents about $140 per month in repayment of $2,000 borrowed for a\nmotorcycle. He also supported his son and spouse, wiring funds to their financial institution in the\nU.S. In November 1999, he sent her $13,000 for a down payment on a home in the U.S. (Ex. D) His\n\nApplicant\u2019s U.S. passport that was issued in May 1996 and expired in May 2006 was not available for review.\n11\nThe only U.S. passport of record (see Ex. 2) is the passport issued July 24, 2006. Applicant testified that he presented\nboth passports to the officer (Tr. 36), but in his answer indicated that he presented both passports on a couple of\noccasions. The Taiwanese passport included in Exhibit 2 bears stamps showing his entry and exit from Taiwan as noted.\n6\nspouse held the mortgage in her name only. (Ex. C) He wired $7,000 to her in February 2000, $8,000\nin June 2000, $9,000 in June 2001, and $9,500 in November 2001. (Ex. D) He sent an additional\n$14,700 in March 2003. (Ex. E)\nFrom July 2001 to July 2004, Applicant was employed as a wireless local area\nnetwork/antenna manager by a commercial computer company in Taiwan that manufactured original\nequipment for several U.S. computer companies. He received company stock as a bonus. As of June\n2006, the company stock was worth about $85,000 US. Applicant maintained three accounts in\nTaiwan: one solely to pay for cellular telephone charges; another in which his job earnings were\ndirectly deposited; and an account with the computer company through which he held the stock.\nApplicant voted in an election in Taiwan held in 2004.\nIn mid-August 2004, Applicant returned to the U.S. permanently (\u2018Transition from a job in\nTaiwan to a job in America because of the kid, a boy.\u201d Ex. 1). He stayed with his spouse and son\nuntil November 2004, he began working as an electrical engineer in antenna design for a technology\ncompany located in another state. Applicant traveled to Taiwan on business for this employer from\nDecember 15, 2004 to December 23, 2004, and from January 5, 2005 to January 14, 2005. Applicant\nspent one evening during these trips with his mother. Applicant had no contact with government\nofficials other than routine border processing. He maintains he presented both his U.S. and\nTaiwanese passports on entry to and exit from Taiwan, although only his Taiwanese passport was\nstamped.  In June 2005, Applicant was laid off.\n11\nApplicant did not return home to live with his spouse and son while he was unemployed and\nlooking for a job. In October 2005, he started working for his present employer about 1,700 miles\naway from his spouse and child. On November 1, 2005, he applied for a security clearance. On his\nelectronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP), Applicant disclosed his and his\nspouse\u2019s dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S. and the Taiwanese residency and citizenship of\nhis parents, two brothers, three sisters, and parents-in-law. Concerning any foreign activities,\nApplicant reported his possession of an active Taiwanese passport from July 1981 to present \u201cused\nmainly for the business traveling. Avoid IN/OUT to Taiwan every year while help for my parent\nhealth.\u201d (Ex.1) He also listed his employment in Taiwan from April 1998 to July 2004, and his\nfinancial assets (salary and stock) in Taiwan.\nTold by a coworker that he would have to give up his foreign citizenship to stay with the U.S.\ndefense contractor, Applicant went to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) on March\n31, 2006, to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. Applicant did not have the documents required. He\nreturned on April 28, 2006, with the necessary documentation and submitted his application to\nrenounce. On May 17, 2006, his Taiwanese citizenship was revoked, and his Taiwanese passport\nissued in May 2001 was invalidated.\nOn June 8, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\ninvestigator in conjunction with his background investigation for a security clearance. Applicant\n\n7\nindicated that he had renounced his Taiwanese citizenship. Asked about his family in Taiwan and\nhis contacts with them, Applicant described his relationship as typical of Taiwan, \u201cthey care much\nfor one another but have little contact, and rarely speak of their own personal lives.\u201d Applicant\naverred that he spoke with his mother about once a year, and with his father and siblings less than\nthat. (Ex. 3) Applicant disclosed that none of his relatives have any government connection except\nfor two sisters, who work for Taiwan\u2019s tax office.\nApplicant was re-interviewed on November 20, 2006, concerning his use of his Taiwanese\npassport and financial interests (money and stocks) in banks in Taiwan. He estimated he had only\n$100 in the account out of which he paid his cellular phone costs, and $4,000 in the account into\nwhich his salary had been deposited and out of which he paid his expenses. Applicant indicated that\nhe had about $5,000 US on deposit and about $85,000 worth of computer company stock. Applicant\nexpressed his intent to close the accounts in the near future.\nApplicant traveled to Taiwan from December 15, 2006 to January 3, 2007. He traveled on\nhis U.S. passport that was recently issued to him in July 2006 for another ten years. While in Taiwan,\nApplicant closed all his financial accounts, cashed in his stocks, and transferred about $61,500 US\nto his credit union account in the U.S. He paid his mother $20,000 he owed her for monies borrowed\nto purchase a car for his spouse back in 1998.\nAs of November 2007, Applicant was renting an apartment near his employment. His spouse\nand son were living in the family\u2019s residence. Applicant\u2019s son is in fourth grade in his local public\nelementary school. Applicant travels to see his son every couple of months depending on holidays,\nstaying ten days each time. For the most part, he does chores when he is there and his son is sad\nwhen he leaves. Applicant calls his spouse weekly. Applicant and his spouse share a banking\naccount. Applicant also has accounts (share, money market, and performance checking) in his name\nonly with a credit union. He has a 401(k) account. The mortgage is paid off on the home he owns\nwith his spouse. Applicant plans to continue working for a few more years and then retire.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings (two brothers and three sisters) are resident citizens of\nTaiwan. The older of Applicant\u2019s two brothers sells safety shoes; the other is a mechanical engineer\nin Taiwan. Applicant claims to not know by whom this brother is employed. The eldest of\nApplicant\u2019s three sisters is a computer engineer for a cellular telephone company that had been\nowned by the Taiwanese government but is now publicly traded. She earned a degree in the U.S. in\nabout 1984.The other two sisters are employed by Taiwan\u2019s tax authority (equivalent to the IRS),\nwith the older focusing on business taxes. Applicant speaks with his mother by telephone two or\nthree times per year. She last called him in October 2007 to ask for assistance. Applicant, who is\nfeeling guilty about time away from his son, is not interested in doing anything more for his parents.\nApplicant has a hard time conversing with his father, but his spouse talks to his father. Applicant has\ntalked to his middle sister once in 2007 about their father\u2019s health. Otherwise, he has spoken to her\nby telephone from the U.S. about three times in the last 27 years. He does not have any ongoing\ncontact with his brothers or other sisters. Applicant testified that when he calls his mother, he does\nnot discuss what his siblings are doing (\u2018It doesn\u2019t make sense to talk about it because, like I said,\nwe are more conservative family so we don\u2019t talk too much about it.\u201d Tr. 93). Applicant has not\ndiscussed his work with his family members in Taiwan or with his spouse in the U.S.\n\n8\nHis spouse\u2019s parents, brother and one sister live in Taiwan as well. His spouse\u2019s other sister,\nwho is married with two children, resides in New Zealand.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-law (age 86) was\na career officer in Taiwan\u2019s army before he retired in about 1969. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law (age\n68) did not work outside the home. Applicant had once monthly telephone contact with his father-in-\nlaw when he was living in Taiwan from April 1998 to August 2004. For about six months in\n2005/06, Applicant tried to assist his father-in-law who was having medical issues. Applicant has\ncontacted him once since January 2007 to encourage him to see a medical professional. Applicant\u2019s\nsister-in-law in Taiwan works as a nurse at a hospital. His spouse\u2019s brother is an electrical engineer.\nApplicant does not have any ongoing contact with any of his former coworkers from the\ncomputer company in Taiwan. In the first year after he returned to the U.S. (2004/05), Applicant had\nemail and telephone contact once monthly with a former coworker from the nonprofit research\ninstitute in Taiwan. In the last six months, Applicant had contact with him by email or telephone\nonce or twice. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B,  foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\n\n9\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6\n6). Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings are resident citizens of his native Taiwan. Applicant has\ntelephone contact with his mother only two to three times yearly, and she initiates the calls for the\nmost part. He has difficulty communicating with his father, who speaks primarily to Applicant\u2019s\nspouse who is living apart from Applicant. However, Applicant and his parents share enough of a\nbond of affection and/or obligation for Applicant to leave behind his spouse and infant son and move\nback to Taiwan for six years after his father suffered a stroke. Applicant also went to Taiwan in 1985\nto persuade his parents to purchase a home and he gave them $5,000 for a down payment. His\nmother lent him $2,000 for a motorcycle, and apparently $20,000 for a car for his spouse in 1998.\nThis financial support is indicative of close ties.\nThe record contains little detail about Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings. What is known\nis that Applicant has limited telephone contact (a few calls in 27 years) with the sister who works\non business tax issues for Taiwan\u2019s tax authority. He has no ongoing contact with his other sisters\nor with his brothers. He testified that his younger brother seldom talked to him of his job and only\ncame to him when he was getting married and said hello, to which Applicant claims he had no\ncomment. (See Tr. 94). They have not traveled from Taiwan to visit him in the U.S. Despite these\nlimited contacts, his relationships with his siblings in Taiwan cannot be considered as casual. When\nhe was interviewed in June 2006, Applicant told a government investigator that despite the little\ncontact, they care much for one another. (See Ex. 3) Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact\nwith a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) is implicated because of the\nheightened risk presented by his bonds to his parents and siblings who are resident citizens of\nTaiwan, two of whom work for Taiwan\u2019s government.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the U.S. Applicant has lived apart from\nhis spouse since April 1998, with the exception of a brief period from August 2004 to December\n2004 when he returned from Taiwan. Given the distance between them and the fact that he largely\nspends his time doing chores when he visits, it is not clear that they have developed the strong\naffections ordinarily characteristic of a marital relationship. However, Applicant undisputably has\na strong sense of obligation to his spouse and son. He provided for them financially when he was\nliving in Taiwan. He also maintains joint financial ties (bank account, house) with his spouse and\nhe telephones her weekly.  Her foreign citizenship presents little concern because of her U.S.\ncitizenship and residency and the absence of any evidence that she actively exercises her Taiwanese\ncitizenship. But heightened concerns are raised because of her family relations in Taiwan. She is\nsufficiently close to her parents to where her mother came to the U.S. to help her on the birth of her\nand Applicant\u2019s son. Applicant had telephone contact with his father-in-law when he was living in\nTaiwan on about a monthly basis and his father-in-law continues to seek his advice on health issues.\nWhile DC \u00b6 7(a) also applies because of his and his spouse\u2019s ties to her relatives in Taiwan, her\nfather\u2019s status as a retired career military officer is not of current security concern since he retired\nin about 1969 and there is no indication of any current association with military personnel or\ninvolvement in military activities.\nIn SOR \u00b6 1.e, the government alleged that Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 1998 and yearly\nfrom approximately 2002 through 2006. Foreign travel even to one\u2019s native land is not security\ndisqualifying in their own right absent evidence of any incidents during that travel that raises\n\n10\nvulnerability to exploitation, pressure or coercion (see \u00b6 7(i) ( conduct, especially while traveling\noutside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion\nby a foreign person, group, government, or country)). Routine checks and registration with\nauthorities are not sufficient to apply DC \u00b6 7(i). However, in this case it is more accurate that\nApplicant traveled to the U.S. annually from Taiwan, where he stayed for some six years to assist\nhis ill father. While in Taiwan, Applicant was employed for a research institute and then a computer\nmanufacturer. Applicant reported this employment on his e-QIP, and reported the income from these\njobs on his U.S. income tax returns filed when he resided in Taiwan. The only source of potential\nvulnerability is the relationship that he has since maintained with a former coworker from the\nresearch institute, which would further implicate \u00b6 7(a) but for the significant reduction in contact\nwith this Taiwanese citizen in the past year.\nThe familial bonds of affection and/or obligation with Applicant\u2019s family members and his\nspouse\u2019s family members living in Taiwan are too strong to satisfy the first prong of mitigating\ncondition  \u00b6 8(a)(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it\nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). While it is not\nclear what Applicant would do if his relatives were pressured, the risk of him being placed in a\nposition where he would have to choose between them and the U.S. is diminished somewhat by the\nfact that Taiwan does not have a hostile relationship with the U.S., and is not known to sponsor\nterrorism. Taiwan has a defense pact with the U.S., and has made considerable progress in achieving\ndemocratic elections, civil liberties, and stable, viable governmental institutions. As reported by the\nU.S. State Department, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and\ncreate a democratic political system since ending marital law in 1987. Almost all restrictions on the\npress have ended, restrictions on personal freedoms have been relaxed, and the prohibition against\norganizing new political parties has been lifted. While the U.S. does not support independence for\nTaiwan and is committed to a one China policy, under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed into law on\nApril 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself, including making available\ndefensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. U.S. commercial ties with Taiwan have been\nmaintained and expanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to jeopardize its relationship with the\nU.S. by overly pressuring its citizens.\nHowever, even nations with a history of friendly relations do not always have the same\ninterests. Taiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As\nrecently as 2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S.\nState Department official that bears troubling implications, although no proof of, active collection\nefforts by or on behalf of the Taiwanese government.\nAs of October 2007, family members in Taiwan were calling him for help in dealing with his\nfather\u2019s eye problem He testified he had no interest in assisting them:\nMy wife asked me did you call home. I said no. To me, I\u2019m not interested to do\nanything more. I\u2019m getting older, I\u2019m working full-time, I have to take care of my\nkid, the kid is growing so quick, I can\u2019t spend too much time. I feel sometimes guilty,\nthat\u2019s how I feel right now. He has fun with me. Every time when I try to come back\n\n11\nhere he starts crying, so I kind of feel guilty at this moment and I want to spend time\nwith my kid.  (Tr. 125)\nAt the same time, he has not ruled out providing assistance if they came to the U.S. (\u201cAnd if they\ncame here, I would probably give them like enough money for survival here, buy the insurance,\nmaybe pay their way and some money for the traveling around here, I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d Tr. 111) Under\nthe circumstances presented, I am unable to apply MC \u00b6 8(a).\nEven strong ties to foreign nationals can be mitigated under MC \u00b6 8(b)(there is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S. that the person can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest). Applicant developed significant ties to the U.S. since he came as a student in\n1981, most notably the acquisition of U.S. citizenship. Yet marriage and the recent birth of his son\nwere not enough to keep him from returning to Taiwan less than ten years ago. During that time, he\ncontinued to pay U.S. income taxes but also paid taxes on his income in Taiwan. He bought a home\nwith his spouse, but even that house is in his spouse\u2019s name. He stayed in Taiwan for six years,\napparently because his research showed a favorable prognosis for stroke victims if no recurrence for\nfive years. (See Tr. 126) While he decided to move back to the U.S. when his son was six, he stayed\nwith his spouse and son only for a few months until he found a job in a distant state. After he was\nlaid off, he did not return to the marital home, but instead took a position with a defense contractor\nlocated no closer to them. Applicant expressed his appreciation for life in the U.S. and a sincere\ndesire to stay here, but the depth of his relationships and loyalties in the U..S. must be questioned\ngiven the six years spent in Taiwan and his inexplicable separation from his spouse and son once he\nreturned. Applicant has not met his burden of overcoming the significant foreign influence concerns\nthat exist because of his and his spouse\u2019s close ties to immediate family members who are resident\ncitizens of Taiwan, a country with a history of targeting U.S. sensitive information.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nUnder guideline C, when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). Applicant, who came to\nthe U.S. on a student visa in about August 1981, became a U.S. citizen ten years later. Applicant\nknowingly exercised a privilege of his native Taiwanese citizenship by continuing to maintain a\nTaiwanese passport, renewing it in 2001 for another ten years. He used the passport  to avoid having\nto obtain a visa to travel to, and from 1998 to 2004, reside in Taiwan. While for convenience and to\nfulfill legal requirements in Taiwan rather than intended as a deliberate preference for Taiwan over\nthe U.S., this voluntary renewal and use of his Taiwanese passport after his U.S. naturalization raises\nserious foreign preference concerns under DC \u00b6 10(a)(1) (exercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the citizenship of a family\nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport).\nForeign preference concerns are also raised by voting in a foreign election (see DC \u00b6 10 (7)\n(voting in a foreign election), and Applicant admitted he had voted in Taiwan in 2004. Since it was\nnot alleged, it cannot be a ground of disqualification, but it is relevant to the extent it shows the\nextent to which Applicant was integrated into Taiwanese society while he lived there from 1998 to\n\n12\n2004. Applicant\u2019s employment for the Taiwanese nonprofit research institute and then the\ncommercial computer company does not fall within any of the specific foreign preference\ndisqualifiers in the absence of any indication that Applicant was acting to serve the interests of the\nforeign entities in conflict with the national security interest. (See \u00b6 10(c)). Applicant\u2019s motivation\nwas purely financial. He needed to support himself and his family that he left behind in the U.S. and\nthere is no evidence that his duties were inconsistent with U.S. interests. Applicant testified with no\nrebuttal from the government that he worked on cellular telephone technology and that the computer\ncompany was an original equipment manufacturer for U.S. computer firms. While he had significant\nfinancial interests in Taiwan (salary until July 2004 and bank deposits and stock until December\n2006), the evidence does not show that he had to maintain his foreign citizenship to protect those\ninterests, and he brought all those assets to the U.S.\nIn mitigation of the foreign preference concerns, Applicant not only surrendered his foreign\npassport to the TECO in late April 2006, but he also renounced his Taiwanese citizenship. His\napplication to renounce was accepted in May 2006. MC \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship) and \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered\nto the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated) apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nUnder the whole person evaluation required under the Directive (The adjudicative process\nis an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that\nthe person is eligible for a security clearance (AG \u00b6 2(a)), Applicant is credited for taking his family\nobligations seriously. His responsible behavior in this regard suggests that he is someone who will\nnot take lightly the fiduciary obligations of a security clearance. Applicant went to the extent of\nrenouncing his Taiwanese citizenship as he believed it was required to retain his defense contractor\njob. On the other hand, it is his strong sense of obligation to foreign family members in Taiwan that\npresents a significant security risk. He sacrificed his career in the U.S. and his relationships with his\nspouse and child for more than six years. His Taiwanese relatives have again asked him for\nassistance, and while he indicates that he is not interested in doing more for them, his history raises\nconsiderable doubts that he will ignore their entreaties. It is not clear what Applicant would do if\nplaced in a position of having to choose between his relatives in Taiwan and U.S. interests.\nAccordingly, I am unable to conclude with a sufficient degree of certainty that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

The delinquent debts currently exceed $36,600.00.  No\nmitigation has been established.  Clearance is denied. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn February 23, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and\nelected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge.  A Notice of Hearing was issued\non April 17, 2007 and the hearing was conducted on May 11, 2007.  At the hearing, the Government\nintroduced five (5) exhibits (Governments Exhibits (GX) 1-5.  Applicant testified and introduced\none (1) exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A.  The transcript was received on May 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He admits all 15 allegations\n1.a. - 1.o.  The admitted allegations are accepted and incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.  \nAfter considering the totality of the evidence of record, I make the following findings as to\neach SOR allegation:\nApplicant served in the Marine Corps from 1967-1970, and part of the time had a security\nclearance (Tr at 27).  He served in Vietnam and received an Honorable Discharge (Tr at 25, 26).  His\nfinancial problems began in 1995-1997, when he and his wife were simply not earning enough\nmoney and began to fall seriously behind on a number of debts.  At one point, his wife lost her job\n(Tr at 29).  He began to use credit cards to cover operating expenses and fell further and further\nbehind (Tr at 20).  \nThey lost their house and moved in with a friend, as a result of which the bills stopped\ncoming and were simply ignored (Tr at 21).  Some debts were recovered by the creditor\u2019s garnishing\nof Applicant\u2019s wages (Tr at 21).  Applicant admits using poor judgment when he began spending\nmore than he and his wife were bringing in (Tr at 22).  He canceled his credit cards, and has not\nobtained any new ones (Id.).  He claims an ability to keep up with current expenses, but has done\nlittle or nothing to resolve the delinquent debts cited in the SOR (Tr at 22).\nGuideline J (Financial Considerations) \n1.a. - Bank A -$7115.00, including $5,000 in original debt, plus interest (Tr at 28).\n1.b. - Bank B - $3274.00\n\n3\n1.c. - Creditor C - $3,676.00\n1.d - Creditor D - $4,060.00\n1.e. - Collection Agency E - $2541.00\n1.f. - Creditor F - Creditor F - $3,035.00\n1.g. - Creditor G - $1,964.00\n1.h. - Creditor H - $1,597.00\n1.i. - Gasoline Company J  -$639.00.

Applicant admits that all of the debts\nare his (Tr at 32) and also admits he remains responsible for all of them, even though some of them\nhave dropped off recent credit reports (Tr at 30).  His wife is not working at present.  He currently\nnets about $900 every two weeks.  \nPOLICIES\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant\nin all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all\nnine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.\nUnder Guideline F, an individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a\nrecent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment and conduct.  \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\n\n4\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination based on the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to\nspeculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make\ncritical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses, here based solely on the written record. \nIn the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers\nwho must be counted on to safeguard classified information and material twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\napplicant for a security clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved\nin conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  These concerns\ninclude consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately\nor inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information\nAn applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government\nof having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or\notherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those\ncontroverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either\nby the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security\nconcerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence\nof conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the\ninterests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  I find that\nthe financial issues in question do raise security concerns under Directive Guideline F.  \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs of the hearing, none of the debts cited in the SOR had been resolved by any payments by\nApplicant, or by any means of resolution.  Applicant did consider filing for bankruptcy protection\nat one point, but did not follow through (Tr at 20).    \nApplicant submitted only one document, a credit report dated May 6, 2007 (AX A), and\npointed out that many of the debts were no longer cited.  However, from his testimony, it is obvious\nthat the reason for the deleted entries was the passage of time, and not anything Applicant had done\nto resolve the debts.  I informed Applicant that the removal of entries from credit reports because\nof the passage of time did not automatically mean that the debts were no longer owing, and it\ncertainly did not demonstrate financial rehabilitation or indicate good judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness.  Applicant conceded this point.  He has in the past paid off five small delinquent\ndebts not cited in the SOR, but has not yet demonstrated any substantive efforts to resolve the cited\n\n5\ndelinquent debts, including the larger ones (Tr at 43, 44).  As to these debts, he has \u201cdone nothing\nin the last 10 or 11 years \u201c (Tr at 47).\nThe record contains sufficient evidence to show that there is no question about Applicant\u2019s\nloyalty to his country.  The problem is that his financial conduct raises concerns under Guideline F\nthat have not been mitigated or extenuated.  There are clearly things he could have done that would\ndemonstrate financial rehabilitation, but Applicant has simply not carried through. \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: 19.(a)\nInability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19.(c) history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns include: None that are established by the\nrecord.  Under the Directive\u2019s whole person concept, I come to the same conclusion.  In summary,\nthe Governments evidence makes a prima facie case against Applicant.  Despite Applicant\u2019s efforts\nto take care of his family, his inability to get control of his finances over more than a decade\nnecessarily raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Guideline F is\nexplicit as to what kind of conduct DoD considers to be disqualifying. \nAt the same time, I am unable to conclude that any of the parallel Mitigating Conditions are\napplicable; e.g., 20.(a) - the debts remain current; 20.(b), 20.(c) and 20.(d) - although the incurring\nof some of the debts may have resulted in part from conditions beyond his control, the long period\nof time during which no substantial resolution took place prevents application of the this mitigating\ncondition.  The evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant currently lacks the judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.          \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.d.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph  l.h.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.i.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.j.          \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.k.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.m.               \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.o.\nAgainst the Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

On September 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns arising under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, which are effective for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn an undated response to the SOR, received by DOHA on October 9, 2009,\nApplicant admitted three of 21 allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.\nDOHA assigned the case to me on November 3, 2009. The parties agreed to a hearing\ndate of December 18, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued to that effect on November\n13, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel introduced six\ndocuments, which were accepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-\n6. Applicant gave testimony and offered eight documents, admitted into the record\nwithout objection as Ex. A-H. Applicant was given until January 8, 2010, to supplement\nMarch 16, 2010\n\n SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a.\n      1\n Ex. 1 (SF-86), but see Tr. 59.

On January 7, 2010, a 14-page document was\nreceived from Applicant without objection and accepted into the record as Ex. I. The\nrecord was closed on January 8, 2010. Based on a thorough review of the testimony,\nsubmissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding the\nfinancial considerations security concerns raised. Security clearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old senior systems engineer working for a defense\ncontractor. He has worked for the same employer since August 2007. Applicant earned\na high school diploma and has completed two years of college. He is married and has a\nchild from a previous marriage.\nApplicant was separated from his first wife in 2001. Paying for two households\nand providing spousal and child support proved to be financially devastating. His ex-\nwife would not sign a balloon loan on the family home which would reduce Applicant\u2019s\nhouse payments and forestall foreclosure. Applicant was advised to file for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy as a method to gain approval for refinancing his home. Once his home was\nsecure, he let the bankruptcy action be dismissed.  Applicant was granted a divorce in\n1\nJanuary 2004.  His spousal support has since been reduced to about $300 a month in\n2\nsupport.\nIn February 2005, Applicant married his current spouse, who works part-time in\ndaycare. Applicant pays for their household expenses while his wife pays for groceries\nand miscellaneous expenditures, such as eating out.  His daughter, now a teen, moved\n3\nin with them in about 2006. Consequently, he ceased paying child support around that\ntime.  His daughter suffers from diabetes, for which medical attention has been required\n4\nand, on at least one occasion, has demanded emergency medical treatment.  In 2007,\n5\nhe was laid off for about two months during a reduction in force at his previous place of\nemployment.6\nSince his separation, Applicant has accumulated some debts which became\ndelinquent. Most of those debts appear to have been owed since the early to mid-\n2000s. Regarding those debts which Applicant wrote after the hearing that payments\nhad been made or would soon be made, he stated that evidence could be later\n\n See Ex. I (Post-hearing submission) at 1-4. At the hearing, however, both parties were told the record\n      7\nwould close upon my receipt of any post-hearing submissions, the deadline for which was January 8, 2010.\nTr. 69-70.\n Tr. 52-53.\n      8\n Tr. 21.\n      9\n Tr. 22.\n      10\n Tr. 22; Ex.

As noted in the SOR allegations, \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.u., the debts at issue are:\n8\n1.b. CREDITOR (MEDICAL) \u2013 $431 owed. Unknown account. Applicant stated that he\nhas disputed this debt\u2019s inclusion on his credit report, but has yet to receive a\nresponse.  \n9\n1.c. CREDITOR (MEDICAL) \u2013 $360 owed. Unknown account.

Under investigation. Applicant stated that he\nremembers paying this utility balance, but did not retain evidence of payment.  After\n12\nthe hearing, he attempted to obtain alternative proof of payment from the collection\nagency, but stated that he has not yet received a response.13\n1.f. CREDITOR \u2013 $7.00 owed. Paid.14\n1.g. CREDITOR (MEDICAL) \u2013 $827 owed. Prepared to pay. Applicant states he has\nmade arrangements to pay off this balance in two payments in February and March\n2010.15\n1.h.

Applicant contacted this creditor.\nHe was told that the account was so old, no record of the debt was maintained.18\n1.k. SUMMARY JUDGMENT REGARDING BOAT \u2013 $44,833 owed. Unpaid/Unresolved.\nThis entry is related to a recreational boat purchased by Applicant and his ex-wife in\n1992. He made regular payments on the purchase until 2002, about the time he was\nseparated and money was scarce due to support payments.  After several months of\n19\nbeing behind in his payments, the vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. Applicant\ntestified the boat was auctioned, but has been unable to discover the purchase price of\nthe boat or discern what liability he now has, if any, on the vehicle.  He is still\n20\nresearching the status of this debt \u201cto resolve this matter in the best interests of all\nparties involved.\u201d  His current credit report does not include this debt, but earlier credit\n21\nreports note a date of last activity in May 2004.22\n1.l. CREDITOR \u2013 $2,146 owed. Payment plan arranged. Applicant received a\nsettlement offer from this creditor on January 4, 2010. He was poised to pay the agreed\nupon amount ($2,343.63) after the record closed.  \n23\n1.m. TELECOMMUNICATIONS \u2013 $314 owed. No evidence of payment. Applicant\ntestified that he paid this balance \u201ca long time ago,\u201d but provided no evidence of\npayment.24\n1.n. CREDITOR \u2013 $60. No evidence of payment. Applicant testified that he paid this\nbalance, but provided no evidence of payment.25\n1.o. CREDITOR \u2013 $3,082. No evidence of payment. Applicant provided evidence that\nhe satisfied an account with this creditor, but his credit report notes that he has had\nmore than one account with that creditor. Lacking evidence that the card upon which\nApplicant paid the balance is the card at issue, he was to provide evidence confirming\n\n Tr. 40-47.\n      26\n Ex. I, supra, note 7 at 3.\n      27\n Tr. 47.\n      28\n Tr. 47-48.\n      29\n Tr. 48.\n      30\n Id.\n      31\n Tr. 49-50.\n      32\n Tr. 51.\n      33\n Ex. I, supra, note 7 at 3.\n      34\n5\nthat the account at issue has been paid.  Although Applicant later wrote that the\n26\ncreditor had confirmed that this account was addressed, he provided no documentary\nevidence to this effect.27\n1.p. CREDITOR \u2013 $2,283. Unpaid. Applicant is trying to determine the status and origin\nof this obligation.28\n1.q. CREDITOR \u2013 $301 owed. Paid. Applicant stated that he paid this balance a\nnumber of years ago through a settlement offer. While he no longer retains a copy of\nthe receipt, the parties\u2019 examination of the credit reports lead to the conclusion that the\ndebt was paid.29\n1.r. CREDITOR (MEDICAL) \u2013 $1,149 owed. No evidence of payment. Applicant\ntestified that while he is willing to pay this debt, he \u201chas done everything in [his] power\nto find out who this is owed to [but] hasn\u2019t been able to identify the creditor on [it.].\u201d30\nThe debt no longer appears on his credit report.  He believes it may be related to\n31\nmedical for his daughter, who first suffered from diabetes and required emergency\nmedical care around the time the debt was acquired.  \n32\n1.s. PUBLISHING ACCOUNT \u2013 $93. No evidence of payment. Applicant has been\naware of this entry on his credit report \u201cfor a while,\u201d but has never ordered anything\nfrom this company.  At the hearing, he expressed his willingness to pay the balance.\n33\nAfter the hearing, he wrote that he submitted a check for $93.99 to the company, but\nhad not yet received evidence the check had cleared or had been received.34\n1.t. TELECOMMUNICATIONS \u2013 $587. No evidence of payment. Applicant provided\nevidence of payment to this entity which he then believed showed payment of the debt\nat issue. Some question remained, however, as to whether his evidence corresponded\n\n Tr. 53-55.\n      35\n Id. at 4.\n      36\n Id.\n      37\n Tr. 57-58.\n      38\n Ex. I, supra, note 7 at 5-6.\n      39\n Id.\n      40\n Id. at 10. See also 65-66. Applicant was apprised of the fact that financial counseling is a consideration\n      41\nin the mitigating of financial considerations security concerns.\n Tr. 64.\n      42\n6\nwith the account at issue.  After the hearing, Applicant confirmed that this is a separate\n35\naccount and valid debt. He wrote that payment was to be made in February 2010.36\n1.u. CREDITOR (MEDICAL) \u2013 $264. Unpaid. Applicant has tried to identify this creditor,\nbut has been \u201cunable to discover any additional information\u201d regarding this debt.37\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s current finances, he testified that he does not \u201clive\nbeyond\u201d his means and he is not irresponsible, \u201cthese things happened do [sic] to a\ndivorce and a change of family life. And if you look at my current credit and my\nobligations, they\u2019re all paid on time, every month. I haven\u2019t been late on anything in\nseveral years now.\u201d  His budget indicates that each month after expenses, he has a\n38\nnet monthly remainder ranging from $1,311 to $6,060 per month.  Although his savings\n39\naccount only has about $60, his wife maintains a savings account with a balance of\napproximately $54,000. Applicant does not participate in a 401k or other retirement plan\nwith his present employer, but he participates in a stock purchase plan which will roll\ninto a 401k-type program in 2010.  He was scheduled to meet with a certified financial\n40\nplanner two weeks after the record closed.  Applicant has not considered a debt\n41\nconsolidation plan after a bad experience in the 1990s in which he \u201cfound out the hard\nway that those trash your credit almost as bad as not paying your bills. So [he has]\nstayed away from that stuff since then.\u201d  \n42\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      43\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      44\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      45\n Id.\n      46\n Id.\n      47\n7\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n43\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n44\n45\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n46\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.47\n\n AG \u00b6 18, which also notes, \u201cAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\n      48\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\n Neither this forum nor this tribunal is designed for or amenable to open-ended monitoring of financial\n      49\nprogress in terms of evidentiary submissions. \n8\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  The guideline sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here,\n48\nApplicant was alleged to have approximately $58,000 in delinquent debt. He provided\nevidence that he has paid approximately $900 of that sum. A debt of about $44,833\nmay have been resolved through the repossession of a boat, reducing his debt to\napproximately $12,260, but Applicant failed to provide evidence that the debt has been\nsatisfied. Given the debts at issue and the lack of evidence of payments, Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply. With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case\nagainst him and mitigate security concerns. \nThe vast majority of debts at issue were incurred and became delinquent several\nyears ago. Most remained neglected until the issuance of the SOR. Although Applicant\nmay not have known all of these accounts were derogatory entries on his credit report,\nhe has at least been aware of the derogatory publishing company debt \u201cfor awhile.\u201d\nConsequently, it may be assumed he has consulted his credit report at some point in\nthe past few years or otherwise knew of its contents. Further, he was informed at the\nhearing that the record would close in January 2010. He ultimately chose to rely on\npost-hearing representations that additional evidence regarding payments made in\n2010 could be later provided \u201cupon request\u201d in lieu of making arrangements to either\npay some or all of the debts during the three weeks provided, or request further time to\npresent appropriate evidence of payment.  Such representations do not equate to\n49\ndocumentary evidence showing that a debt has been paid, settled, satisfied, or\notherwise resolved. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)\ndoes not apply. \nIn 2001, when Applicant filed for bankruptcy to save his home from foreclosure,\nhe had recently separated from his first wife. The debt at issue mostly arose between\nthat time and 2004, when Applicant was finally divorced. Finances continued to be tight,\n\n9\nalbeit to a lesser degree, until his daughter came to live with him in about 2006 and he\nwas no longer responsible for child support. Additionally, he was unemployed for about\ntwo months in 2007. Such factors give rise to FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies.\nApplicant was apprised of the fact that financial counseling was a consideration\nthat could be applied toward the mitigation of finance-based security concerns, but he\nfailed to begin or complete such counseling before the record was closed.\nConsequently, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control) does not apply.\nApplicant provided documentary evidence of payment constituting about $900 of\nthe approximately $58,000 at issue. Such effort is minimal. Giving him the benefit of the\ndoubt regarding the boat debt, which may have been resolved, Applicant still owes over\n$12,000. Under either scenario, FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) would not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s progress on his debt balance rests highly on whether the boat debt\nhas been addressed. Applicant failed, however, to timely submit evidence that this debt\nis no longer owed or that it has been substantially reduced. Consequently, his\noutstanding debt still appears to remain somewhere between about $12,000 and\napproximately $57,000. Either sum is significant and sustains security concerns.\nMoreover, while he has made some nominal progress in actual payments to some of\nhis creditors, he failed to provide evidence regarding accounts he testified he has\ndisputed. Furthermore, while his testimony was consistently credible, he failed to\nsubstantiate his claims that those payments set to be made in the near future were\nactually transacted before the record closed, or to, on his own initiative, request leave to\nsubmit such evidence as soon as it became available. Lacking tangible evidence of\nmore significant progress on the debts at issue, financial considerations security\nconcerns remain unmitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n10\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature, educated, and credible witness who incurred significant\ndebt during and after his 2001 separation from his first wife. He did so because spousal\nand child support, plus the maintenance of two households, proved to be financially\nonerous. In the interim, his debt became delinquent. By 2006, however, payment of\nchild support was obviated when his daughter came to live with him. Around that same\ntime or shortly thereafter, payments to his ex-wife were reduced to about $300 a month.\nDespite the lessening of these financial burdens, his debts remained neglected while\nApplicant otherwise continued to live significantly within his means.\nThe evidence shows that Applicant knew about at least some of the debts at\nissue, but took no, or exercised minimal, effort to address them before the SOR was\nissued. He eschewed the pursuit of a consolidation loan and chose not to seek financial\ncounseling to help him address his debt. He provided only minor evidence that prior to\nthe hearing he had applied any of his substantial monthly net income toward satisfying\nhis delinquent debts. With regard to those debts Applicant testified he has disputed, he\npresented no evidence of formal dispute with either his creditors or the credit reporting\nbureaus. With regard to the largest debt alleged, the boat judgment, he apparently\nfailed to seek documentation confirming that his debt was either reduced or relieved. \nIn short, while it is very possible that a significant portion of the debt at issue has\nbeen properly disputed or otherwise addressed, Applicant only provided documentary\nevidence that approximately $900 dollars of the approximately $58,000 at issue has\nbeen paid. In these cases, the burden is placed squarely on the Applicant to provide\nmitigating evidence. In that burden, Applicant failed. While Applicant\u2019s representations\nindicate sufficient evidence of significant progress may be available in the near future\nthat would adequately mitigate security concerns, consideration of the debts\nenumerated in the September 2009 SOR is not open-ended. For lack of adequate\ndocumentation, financial considerations security concerns remain unmitigated.\nClearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b\n \nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.c\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d \n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f \n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h  \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j \n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l \n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q  \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r \n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t \n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u  \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 55-year-old computer specialist who has worked for a federal contractor for\nthe past four years. He admitted that he has occasionally used marijuana from 1972 until May 2006,\n\n2\nbut does not intend to use it in the future. He failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by a\nhistory of drug abuse. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 8, 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86). On March\n7, 2006, Applicant electronically submitted another application (e-QIP). The Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. As\nrequired by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2. (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 14, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision-\nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 28, 2006, and waived his right to a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. However, on January 9, 2007, the Government requested a hearing. The case\nwas assigned to me on January 26, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 8, 2007,\nsetting the case for February 28, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1and 2 into\nevidence without objections.  Applicant testified in his case and introduced Applicant Exhibit (AX)\nA into evidence without an objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 12,\n2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 55-year-old computer networker for a federal contractor. He is divorced and has\nthree grown children with whom he has a good relationship. He is a highly accomplished and\nsuccessful computer specialist, who has worked in the field for many years. He began his present job\nas a consultant four years ago and was hired as an employee two years ago (Tr.15). This is his first\nposition with a federal contractor (Tr. 18).

He appreciates\nthe seriousness of this situation (Tr. 28).\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the past three years wrote a letter in support of Applicant. He\nconsiders Applicant very capable and someone who exhibits an \u201cunusually high level of integrity.\u201d\n(AX A) He believes Applicant \u201chas proven to be sober and steady in all the dealings I have had with\nhim.\u201d (Id.)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position. . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). Each security clearance decision \u201cmust be a fair and impartial common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration of all relevant and material information and the pertinent\ncriteria and adjudication policy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\nGuideline H: Drug Involvement\nThe security concern under Guideline H is that the use of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and  trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n\nAG 24(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) Drugs, materials,\n1\nand other chemical compounds . . . (marijuana or canabis).\n4\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admission that he has used marijuana from 1972 to May 2006, the\nGovernment established a disqualification under Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC)\n25(a) (any drug abuse).1\nAfter the Government raised a security concern, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. Four conditions can mitigate security concerns arising from drug\ninvolvement. After reviewing all of them, I conclude as follows: \n(1) Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) 26(a) the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment does not\napply because Applicant\u2019s has been smoking marijuana illegally for more than 30 years, which does\ncast doubt on his good judgment.\n(2) Applicant provided some evidence of mitigation for SOR \u00b6 1.b under DI MC 26(b) a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. In his response to the SOR, he stated, \u201cMy\ncareer and contributions to my employer hold a great deal more importance to me. I will 1)\ndiscontinue any and all use of marijuana and 2) submit to any substance abuse testing at any time.\u201d\n(Answer, dated January 3, 2007). This statement falls within the spirit of subparagraph (4) of 26 (b)\na signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violations. The other\nthree subparagraphs do not apply. \n(3) DI MC 26(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during\nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended is not applicable to the situation.\n(4) DI MC 26(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including\nbut not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional is not applicable because Applicant did\nnot participate in any program.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline,\nthe adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable\ninformation about the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced\ndecision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case is known as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d analysis. Directive \u00b6 E2.2. In evaluating the conduct of the applicant, an administrative judge\nshould consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, his demeanor while testifying, and very candid disclosures about his\n\n5\nmarijuana use for more than thirty years. Although I was rather surprised by his lack of awareness\nof the detrimental effect illegal marijuana use could have on his job, I took into account his\nexpressed intention to stop using it, including a willingness to participate in a rehabilitation program\nif necessary. Given his present concern for his career, I believe he will initiate the steps necessary\nto resolve this situation in the future. However, at this time he did not mitigate the allegation under\nSOR \u00b6 1.a, but did mitigate the allegation under \u00b6 1.b. Accordingly, Guideline H is found against\nhim.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline H (Drug Involvement)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly not\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

She has returned to work, and paid, made payment\narrangements, or made a good-faith effort to pay the nine debts listed in the Statement of Reasons.\nApplicant presented sufficient information to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nG overnment Exhibit (G E) 1(Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance App lication) was\n1\nsigned by Applicant on D ecember 5, 2006. G E 2 is an electronic version of her SF 86 dated M ay 5,\n2005.\nO n Aug. 3 0 , 2 0 06, the U nder Secretary of D efense (Intelligence) published a memorandum\n2\ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative G uideline to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the D irective and D epartment of Defense (D oD ) R egulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram  (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SO R was issued on or after Sep. 1,\n2006.

Her admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of\nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.  \nApplicant is 48 years old.  She graduated from high school in June 1977. Tr. 26. She has\n3\nbeen married to her third husband since November 1997. She was married to her first husband from\nJune 1979 to January 1982, and married to her second husband from July 1984 to April 1993.  Her\nfirst two marriages ended by divorce. She has a 21-year-old daughter, who was born during her\nsecond marriage. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a field manager since\nApril 2005. Tr. 26. She has successfully held security clearances intermittently since 1981 and has\nheld her current interim secret security clearance since 2005. \n\n3\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR lists nine unpaid debts ranging from\n$46 to $12,496, exceeding $23,000. Two of the largest debts are for automobile loans in which\nApplicant fell behind during periods of time she and/or her husband were out of work due to injuries.\nOf those nine debts, Applicant paid off six debts, made payment arrangements on two debts, and is\nmaking a good faith attempt to resolve the remaining one debt.\nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to being a single mother following her\nseparation and divorce from her second husband, her husband\u2019s two severe work-related accidents,\nher one severe worked-related accident, and four operations which either interrupted her ability to\nwork and/or for which there were uncovered medical expenses. In total, her husband was out of work\nfor seven years recovering from his accidents and she was out of work for two-and-one-half years\nrecovering from her accident. With Applicant and her husband now working full-time, they have\nrestored their income stream and are able to remain current. They also received settlements from\ntheir accidents, which they have used to pay off debts that arose while they were unable to work.\nApplicant submitted a post-hearing budget that reflects a joint net remainder of\napproximately $1,300. Her hearing and post-hearing materials reflect an earnest effort to document\ngood-faith attempts to achieve financial stability. She recognizes the importance of overcoming her\nindebtedness and the adverse impact non-payment of debts may have on her clearance. She consulted\nwith a financial counselor and determined it would be more cost effective and efficient for her to\ndeal with her creditors directly. Applicant\u2019s supervisor as well as a co-worker testified on her behalf.\nApplicant also submitted eight letters of reference. AE A through H. Her witnesses and reference\nletters strongly support the notion Applicant is a trusted and valuable employee who is making a\nsignificant contribution to the national defense.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and\nMitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n4\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR\nCase N o. 04-11463 at 2 (App. B d. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing D irective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cT his is\nsomething less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\nc o nc lusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported b y\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal M aritim e Com m \u2019n, 383 U .S. 607, 620 (1966).\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nW ashington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cT he Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\n5\nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circum stances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the D irective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion\nunder D irective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (App. B d. July 6, 2006). \n4\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing\ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that\n4\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying\ncondition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\nRevised Guidelines at 13-14 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n6\nDC 19(a) is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d\n7\nDC 19(c) is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n8\nMC 20(d) \u201cis the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\n9\ndebts.\u201d\nMC 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the persons control\n10\n(e.g., loss of employment,  . . . unexpected medical emergency, . . .a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n5\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n6\nsignificant unpaid debts.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to general funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHer history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n7\n8\nF. The record is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received credit in mitigation.  The most pertinent mitigating condition is the fourth\nMC  of Guideline F, because Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay or settle the nine debts\n9\nlisted in the SOR. Her good-faith effort is established by her actions. With the help of work-related\nsettlements, and she and her husband returning to full-time status, Applicant has the funds to pay off\nher creditors. She also receives credit in mitigation under the second MC  as a result of she and her\n10\nhusband\u2019s loss of work through injuries, she and her husband\u2019s extensive medical problems, and her\nbeing a single mother following her separation an divorce. \nAnd unlike many applicants in financial cases, Applicant verified her actions by providing\nsubstantial documentary proof of payment or settlement of her debts.  Applicant has addressed her\nfinancial problems, has cash left over, and is otherwise living within her means. Although she can be\nfaulted for taking too long to address her indebtedness, she has since taken action to minimize and\novercome concerns about her financial situation. Her history of successfully maintaining security\nclearances without incident stemming back to 1981 and her positive employment record weigh\nheavily in her favor in assessing her security eligibility under the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.\n\nSee ISCR Case N o. 04-06242 at 2 (App. B d. June 28, 2006). \n11\n6\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.  Likewise, she has met her\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n11\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case.\nFor the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1 - Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a - i:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nRobert J. Tuider\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2002. He married in 2001. His wife was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and moved with her first husband to the U.S. in 1992. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2003. She has two daughters from her first marriage. One who resides with her ex- husband in the U.S. and the other resides with her and Applicant. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen of the PRC and resides with Applicant and his wife in the U.S. Prior to their marriage he resided with Applicant\u2019s wife since 1997. Applicant\u2019s wife provided a statement that her father is a permanent resident of the U.S. with a green card.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 4, 2007, and elected to have a \nhearing. The hearing was set for January 29, 2008. Prior to the hearing, Applicant, \nthrough counsel requested that his hearing be converted to an administrative \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \ndetermination and submitted a written brief in mitigation. Department Counsel did not \nobject and the assigned Administrative Judge agreed to convert the case to an \nadministrative determination. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of \nrelevant material (FORM) on January 27, 2009. Applicant was afforded an opportunity \nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant \ndid not object to the FORM and submitted additional material within the appropriate time \nlimit. The case was reassigned to me on March 12, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested Administrative Notice be taken of Items I through \nIX. These Items are Hearing Exhibits. No objections were noted and the request is \ngranted.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2002. He \nmarried in 2001. His wife was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and moved \nwith her first husband to the U.S. in 1992. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n2003. She has two daughters from her first marriage. One who resides with her ex-\nhusband in the U.S. and the other resides with her and Applicant.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen of the PRC and resides with Applicant and \nhis wife in the U.S. Prior to their marriage he resided with Applicant\u2019s wife since 1997. \nApplicant\u2019s wife provided a statement that her father is a permanent resident of the U.S. \nwith a green card. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s wife has telephonic contact with her mother one to \nthree times a month. She sends her approximately $1,000 to $1,500 a year as a gift. \nHer contact with her brother is maybe once a year. No information was provided \nregarding how Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law supports herself or if she receives any type of \nsupport from the PRC government. Applicant and his wife do not know how his brother-\nin-law is employed. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s has not talked to her brother in a couple years and \nis not sure what he is doing. In her written statement she said, \u201cnone of my family has \never worked in a position for [the] PRC or is a member of the Communist Party.\u201d1 \n \n1 Item 13. It is noted that Applicant\u2019s sworn answer to the SOR is part of the record. Additional \ninformation provided is through a brief that is signed by Applicant\u2019s attorney and is argument and not \nevidence. The documents included with the brief are considered evidence. I have received a signed \nstatement from Applicant\u2019s wife and an additional signed statement from Applicant dated February 25, \n2009, along with other documents. I have only included those facts supported by evidence that was \nprovided to me by either Department Counsel or Applicant. I have considered Department Counsel\u2019s brief \nand Applicant\u2019s attorney\u2019s brief as persuasive argument, but not evidence. Since there were no objections \nto documents provided by Department Counsel and offered as evidence, I have considered them. I have \nalso considered those documents offered by Applicant as evidence and not objected to.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nNo information was provided as to what contact Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \nmaintains with his wife and/or son in the PRC. No information was provided as to \nwhether Applicant\u2019s father-in-law intends on visiting his family in the PRC. No \ninformation was provided as to what contact he maintains with other relatives or friends \nthat are in the PRC.  \n \n \nApplicant traveled to the PRC in 2001 with his then fianc\u00e9 to meet his future \nmother-in-law prior to their marriage.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he consumed alcohol, at times to excess, and to the point of \nintoxication, from 1971 to at least October 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on about January 12, 1986, and charged with Driving \nUnder the Influence of Alcohol (DUI). He was found guilty, fined and placed on three \nyears probation. \n \n \nApplicant was treated in a 28-day inpatient alcohol treatment program in about \n1995. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on about August 10, 1996, and charged with DUI. He \npleaded guilty to Reckless Driving and was fined $750, and ordered to attend Alcoholics \nAnonymous meetings and obtain alcohol counseling.  \n \n \nApplicant had multiple weekend detoxication treatments from 1994 to 1997. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on about January 25, 2005, and charged with DUI and \nimproper left turn. Applicant was involved in a traffic accident. He hit another vehicle. A \nwitness helped Applicant out of his car and smelled alcohol. The victim in the car that \nwas struck by Applicant\u2019s car was transported to the hospital with head and neck \ninjuries. The victim\u2019s son was a passenger and he was also transported to the hospital. \nIt is unknown what his condition was or the final diagnosis of either victim. Applicant\u2019s \nhead was bleeding and he was transported to the hospital. His car had two 12-packs of \nbeer, one was full and the other had 3 cans of beer remaining. Applicant denied drinking \nalcohol and claimed he had consumed cold medication. He refused to take a \nbreathalyzer and a search warrant was obtained. A blood alcohol test was administered \nand the toxicology results were: Blood Alcohol: 0.32% grams ethanol/100 ml blood.  \n \n \nApplicant pled guilty to DUI and was sentenced to 365 days in jail, 355 \nsuspended, and 20 days home confinement. He was placed on probation for 18 \nmonths, fined about $1,500, and ordered to complete 120 hours of community service. \nHe was required to install an interlock system in his vehicle, complete an inpatient \nalcohol treatment program and an aftercare program.  \n \n \nApplicant was treated in an inpatient alcohol recovery program from about March \n2, 2005, to May 10, 2005, for a condition diagnosed, in part, as Alcohol Dependence \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nwith withdrawal symptoms, by a licensed substance abuse counselor under the \nsupervision of a psychologist.2  \n \n \nClinical records from his treatment in May 2005 reflect he had up to nine medical \ndetoxes in his past. He had been in three motor vehicle accidents. He was drinking prior \nto all three of the accidents. He did not remember how much he had to drink prior to the \nlast accident when his blood alcohol was .32%. The other accidents involved falling \nasleep after drinking and one time he hit a stationary object.3 His clinical report stated \nthat the longest period he had been alcohol free was 15 months in 2000 to 2001. He \nfirst used alcohol when he was 16 and used it on and off since that time. In his late 20s \nhe was a heavy drinker. Six months prior to the clinical report in May 2005, he reported \nhe was drinking alcohol every day. He has drank as much as a case of beer and fifth of \nwhiskey at a time.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s clinical report reflected a good prognosis while he was in treatment \nand addressing his substance abuse issues. At that time he was actively participating in \nall groups, classes, recreational activities, and individual counseling sessions. He was \ndischarged from treatment to the probation services program of the state which was to \nmonitor his after care program and involvement in a community based twelve-step \nprogram.5 \n \n \nApplicant continued weekly aftercare from February 2006 to August 2006. He \nhad a relapse and drank alcohol a few months after starting the aftercare program after \nhe had some dental work.6  \n \n \nA letter from Applicant to his attorney dated January 23, 2008, provided as an \nenclosure to a brief from the attorney states the following:  \n \nI regularly attend 2-3 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings a week in \naddition to attending weekly aftercare sessions. I have an ignition interlock \nsystem installed in my car that is required by the Department of Motor \nVehicle (DMV). I plan to keep the ignition interlock installed in my car even \nfollowing completing the DMV requirement.7 \n \n \nIt appears Applicant continued to attend some type of aftercare program that \nextended through January 2008. However, the specifics of this aftercare program are \n \n2 Items 7, 8 and 9. \n \n3 Item 7. \n \n4 Items 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. \n \n5 Item 9. \n \n6 Item 11. \n \n7 Item 13. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nuncertain. It is self-described by its executive director as providing \u201ceco-psychological \nservices to people, including traditional rites of passage ceremonies and spiritual \nretreats.\u201d8 \n \n \nApplicant was afforded the opportunity to respond to the FORM to provide \nupdated information about his current alcohol use and recovery. The brief submitted by \nApplicant\u2019s attorney states the following:  \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his alcoholism, addressed issues of alcohol \nabuse, has provided evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence or responsible use: Applicant \nhas successfully completed inpatient treatment on May 10, 2005. \nApplicant has continued in an aftercare program through the current date9 \nto ensure maintenance of responsible use.10 \n \nI do not have evidence that Applicant is currently in an aftercare program. I do not know \nif Applicant abstains from drinking alcohol or continues to use it. I have no independent \nevidence provided by Applicant to show he has been attending an aftercare program to \ndate or is participating in AA or if he is abstaining from the use of alcohol. The most \nrecent information provided regarding any aftercare is dated May 31, 2007, with a \nfollow-on letter dated January 23, 2008, more than 14 months ago.  \n \n \nThe most recent statement from Applicant is dated February 25, 2009, and it \nstates the following:  \n \n \nI have continued to participate in aftercare since my discharge from \nresidential treatment in 2005. I also continue to participate in AA. My \nresponsible use of alcohol is evidenced by commendations from my \nemployer for my work.11 \n \nApplicant admits in this statement that he continues to consume alcohol despite being \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependent. I have no information as to how much alcohol \nApplicant currently consumes. I have no information from Applicant as to how this is \nconsistent with his diagnosis as alcohol dependent or with attending alcohol treatment \naftercare, and AA, and how it is consistent with the 12-step program.  \n \n \n \n \n8 Item 13. \n \n9 Presumable the date of the brief February 29, 2009. \n \n10 Item 13. \n \n11 Applicant\u2019s statement dated February 25, 2009. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China12 \n \nChina has powerful military forces, including strategic nuclear missiles. China is \ngeographically vast, and has a population of over a billion people. It has significant \nresources, and an economy that in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. \nChina aggressively competes with the United States in many areas. PRC\u2019s competitive \nrelationship with the United States exacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s and his \nwife\u2019s connections to family members living with them and living in the PRC.   \n \nIn China reported human rights problems include suppression of political dissent, \narbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture and mistreatment of prisoners. \nThe PRC also monitors communications devices, such as telephone, facsimile, and \ninternet. \n \nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human \nrights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention, \nforced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment. \n \n \nChina actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information \nabout the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a \nglobal power; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific Rim and \nAsia; and (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China desires \nfor economic growth. China\u2019s active intelligence gathering programs focus on sensitive \nand protected U.S. technologies. China\u2019s espionage activities and industrial theft \nactivities are so extensive they represent a leading threat to U.S. technology.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n12 HE I through IX; Item 12. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent, and  \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependent by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nfacility.  \n \nApplicant has been arrested for three alcohol-related incidences; two have \nresulted in convictions for DUI and one for reckless driving. Two involved traffic \naccidents, one with injuries to people in a car Applicant struck. Applicant has been \nthrough inpatient alcohol treatment in 1995 and was arrested in 1996 for the above \nmentioned offense that was reduced to reckless driving. He attended AA for a period \ntime and alcohol counseling. He has had multiple detoxification treatments in 1994 \nthrough 1997. He was again arrested and convicted of DUI in 2005. He again attended \nan inpatient alcohol recovery program and was diagnosed as alcohol dependent. He \nattended an aftercare program. I find disqualifying conditions (a) and (c) apply. I do not \nhave any evidence that the diagnosis of alcohol dependence was made by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment facility. I \ndo have evidence Applicant was diagnosed by a licensed substance abuse counselor \nunder the supervision of a psychologist. However, this diagnosis does not comply with \nthe requirements of disqualifying condition (e) and hence does not apply.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 including the \nfollowing:  \n \n(a) so much time as passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not case doubt o the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nha established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholic Anonymous or a similar organization \nand has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \n\n \n9 \n \n \nprofessional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \n \nApplicant has a very long history of alcohol abuse. He has a history of relapse \ndespite intensive inpatient treatment. It appears he successfully completed his last \ninpatient treatment in 2005. He also attended aftercare. I am concerned about the lack \nof recent information about Applicant\u2019s current use of alcohol. He refers to his modified \nconsumption of alcohol vice his abstinence from alcohol use. Based on his long history \nof alcohol abuse and likely dependency I find the record conspicuously void of recent \nindependent information about his use of alcohol, recent attendance in an aftercare \nprogram, and his attendance at AA. Applicant\u2019s \u201cmodified consumption\u201d appears \ninconsistent with his AA attendance. Based on Applicant\u2019s long history of alcohol \nproblems I do not have sufficient credible, reliable and substantiated evidence that he is \ncurrently in recovery and abstaining from alcohol, or that his problems with alcohol are \nunlikely to recur. There may be credible evidence that Applicant has maintained a sober \nlifestyle and is actively participating in a long-term recovery plan, but he has not \nprovided reliable evidence to convince me of such. I also do not have reliable, credible \nand substantiated evidenced that he has overcome his problem and established a \npattern of abstinence. Applicant\u2019s attendance at work does not rise to the level to \nconvince me he has resolved his alcohol problems. Therefore, I find mitigating \nconditions (a) and (b) do not apply. \n \n \nApplicant did not provide any corroborated current evidence that he is actively \nparticipating in a counseling or treatment program. He made a statement and his \nattorney argued he was currently participating in one, but I did not receive any \nindependent evidence sufficient to mitigate the security concern. Nonspecific \ninformation that was provided is over a year old. Due to Applicant\u2019s long history of \nalcohol abuse I find this nominal evidence insufficient. Hence, I find (c) does not apply. \n \n \nBased on the above analysis I also find mitigating condition (d) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant may have completed inpatient and aftercare requirements, I do not \nhave any current independent evidence or corroboration as to Applicant\u2019s present \nalcohol consumption, or as he refers to it as \u201cmodified consumption\u201d and a prognosis by \na duly qualified professional as to his prognosis based on that consumption. Based \nsolely on the record before me there are too many gaps regarding Applicant\u2019s \nconsumption and recovery to conclude Applicant\u2019s alcohol problem is no longer a \nsecurity concern. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \n\n \n10 \n \n \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or person, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nApplicant\u2019s wife and father-in-law share living quarters with him. His father-in-law \nis a citizen of the PRC. His wife, a U.S. citizen, maintains regular contact with her \nmother who is a citizen of and resides in the PRC. His wife maintains lesser contact with \nher brother. She also sends her mother gifts. No information was provided as to what \ncontact Applicant\u2019s father-in-law maintains with his wife or son in the PRC. No \ninformation was provided as to what other contacts his father-in-law maintains in the \nPRC. I find disqualifying conditions (a) and (c) apply because of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ncontact with her relatives in the PRC. I also find (b) applies because of Applicant\u2019s \ncontact with his father-in-law, a PRC citizen, who lives with him.  \nAG \u00b6 8 describes conditions that may be mitigating. I have considered all of them \nand especially considered the following:  \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization and interests of the \nU.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \n\n \n11 \n \n \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. \ninterests; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under the Foreign Influence Guideline. However, if a \nrelative lives in a foreign country and Applicant, or in this case, his wife, has frequent \nnon-casual contact with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential \nfor foreign influence. \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nare vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. The complicated competitive \nrelationship of the PRC with the U.S. places a significant, but not insurmountable \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with his family in \nthe PRC, his wife\u2019s relationships, and his father-in-laws connections to the PRC does \nnot pose a security risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between \nloyalty to the U.S. and his family members. The PRC has a mixed human rights record, \nand other political, economic, and military rivalry with the U.S. It is conceivable that the \nPRC would target any citizen in an attempt to gather valuable information from the U.S.  \n \n \nBased on the limited facts provided, I am unable to adequately analyze the depth \nand specifics of the relationship that Applicant has with his father-in-law, a PRC citizen \nwho lives with him. I have not been provided with sufficient background information \nabout his father-in-law\u2019s future intentions. I have not been provided sufficient in depth \ninformation about Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s relationship with her mother and her mother and \nbrother\u2019s background information. Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion and \nbased on the limited information provided I cannot find a conflict of interest does not \nexist or that a heighten risk does not exist. Perhaps that is the case, but at this juncture \nApplicant failed to provide the extensive information required to sufficiently analyze the \ncomplex foreign family relationships and meet his burden. Therefore, I find that none of \nthe mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 53 years old and has a \nlong history of alcohol abuse and alcohol related incidents. He has been convicted twice \nof DUI and an alcohol related Reckless Driving charge. He has attended inpatient and \noutpatient alcohol treatment and been involved in aftercare programs, and AA. \nApplicant failed to provide current information about his alcohol use and continuing \nrecovery. His reference to modified consumption is a cause of concern. Applicant has \nfamily members who are citizens and residents of the PRC. His father-in-law, who lives \nwith him, is a citizen of the PRC. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains regular contact with her \nmother, who is a citizen of and resides in the PRC. Insufficient evidence was presented \nto properly analyze the potential security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s foreign \nrelatives. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from alcohol \nconsumption and foreign influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

TUIDER\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct consisting of five arrests over a six-year period, four\nof which involved physical altercations requiring law enforcement involvement, and deliberate\nfalsification of his security clearance application raised criminal and personal conduct concerns.\nAlthough Applicant submitted evidence of good character/job performance, he was unable to\novercome or sufficiently mitigate concerns raised.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nG overnment Exhibit (G E) 2 (Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clearance App lication) was\n1\nsigned  by Applicant on January 3, 2005.  T he G overnment also offered G E 1, an SF 86, submitted on\nJanuary 12, 2005.  T he SO R refers to G E 2, which alleges falsification concerns under G uideline E. \nO n Aug. 30 , 20 06, the U nder Secretary of D efense (Intelligence) p ub lished a memorandum\n2\ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative G uideline to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the D irective and D epartment of Defense (D oD ) R egulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram  (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SO R was issued on or after Sep. 1,\n2006. T he revised Ad judicative G uidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case.\n2\nOn January 3, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nMarch 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal\nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer dated and notarized on January 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 16, 2007. On July 20, 2007,\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on August 10, 2007.  The hearing\nwas held as scheduled.  The government offered four documents, which were admitted without\nobjection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4.  The Applicant offered 12 documents, which\nwere admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through N.  I left the record open after\nthe hearing to afford Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documents.  The Applicant\nsubmitted additional documents, which were admitted without objection as AE M.  DOHA received\nthe transcript on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e., DOHA alleged under Guideline J that Applicant was (1)\narrested, charged and convicted of criminal mischief/damage property intentionally, recklessly or\nnegligently in April 1997; (2) arrested and charged with disorderly conduct/engage in fighting and\ncriminal mischief/damage property intentionally, recklessly or negligently and convicted of criminal\nmischief/damage property intentionally, recklessly or negligently in May 1997; (3) arrested, charged\nand convicted of disorderly conduct/engage in fighting in April 2001; (4) arrested, charged and\nconvicted of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol in April 2002; and (5) arrested, charged\nand convicted of harassment/strike, shove, kick in October 2002.  All convictions resulted from\nApplicant pleading guilty.  Additionally, Applicant admitted these allegations as well as SOR \u00b6 1.f.\nAt the time of these arrests, Applicant was age 25, 26, 29, 30, and 31, respectively.\n\n3\nApplicant denied the remaining allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a., which alleged that he intentionally\nfalsified a response in his SF 86 regarding his arrest record.  In addition, after a thorough review of\nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior systems engineer, who has worked for his defense\ncontractor employer since June 2004.  He also has been a member of the Army National Guard since\nFebruary 1996, and holds the rank of Sergeant First Class (pay grade E-7).  With prior service in the\nArmy Reserve and Marine Corps, Applicant estimates he has 19 years of service.  Applicant seeks\nto renew his security clearance for his civilian job.  However, both positions require Applicant to\nmaintain a security clearance.  Tr. 64-65.  \nApplicant is married to his third wife and has two children, a nine-year-old son, and a one-\nyear-old daughter.  He was married to his first wife from November 1992 to May 1994, and married\nto his second wife from August 1997 to December 2001.  Those marriages ended by divorce.  He\nmarried his third wife in April 2004.  He has custody of his son, who was born during his second\nmarriage.  Tr. 63.  Applicant is a high school graduate, and has accumulated approximately 80\ncollege level semester hours with a GPA of 3.3/3.5.  Tr. 64.\nAt his hearing, Applicant provided explanations surrounding his five arrests which spanned\na six-year period from 1997 to 2002.  The April 1997 arrest involved a bar fight in which Applicant\nexplained he was struck in the head by an unidentified assailant and in which he broke a plate glass\nwindow.  He stated he did not start the fight.  He explained he plead guilty because he \u201cfigured it\nwould be easier to just pay the fine and be done with it.\u201d  Tr. 17-20.  \nThe May 1997 arrest occurred when he became involved in an altercation with his younger\nsister\u2019s boyfriend.  He intervened to move his sister away from the boyfriend.  A fight ensued in a\ngas station and \u201csome merchandise and some racks were broken . . . in the store.\u201d  Tr. 21-24.  \nThe April 2001 arrest occurred when he walked into a nightclub and \u201cgot blindsided by a\nbeer bottle.\u201d  Applicant stated the individual who hit him with the beer bottle claimed he bumped\ninto him.  Applicant further stated after he left the nightclub, the individual pursued him and a fight\nensued.  According to the Applicant, he repeatedly tried to withdraw.  Tr. 24-28.  \nWhen queried by Department Counsel whether he sought any anger management classes,\nApplicant responded he did not.  However, he stated, \u201c. . . not long after that, that [he decided] that\nI should just stay out of those places.  I should just not go there anymore.  So I don\u2019t go to clubs or\nbars anymore.\u201d  Tr.28-29.  \nThe April 2002 DUI arrest occurred following over consumption of alcohol following a\nsoftball game.  Applicant stated his BAC was .10 after consuming 2 and a half beers.  As part of his\nsentence following this arrest, he was required \u201cto attend forty hours of alcohol awareness and there\nwas an anger management portion of that, of that proceeding.  It wasn\u2019t a one-on-one type of anger\nmanagement thing, but it was kind of a group thing.  We discussed situations.  That\u2019s, that\u2019s about\nall I can recall.\u201d  Tr. 29-31.  \n\n4\nApplicant stated the October 2002 arrest occurred when he confronted six men who made\nunwanted overtures to his girlfriend and her friends following a bachelorette party.  A fight ensued,\nwhich resulted in his being arrested.  Tr. 31-34.\nQuestion 26 of Applicant\u2019s January 3, 2005, SF 86 asks, \u201c26.  Your Police Record - Other\nOffenses For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been\n\u2018sealed\u2019 or other otherwise stricken from the court record.  The single exception to this requirement\nis for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an\nexpungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C 844 or 18 U.S.C 3607.  In the last 7 years, have\nyou been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23,\n24, or 25?  (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\nApplicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  Pertinent portions in his response the SOR, Applicant said:\nI misread the instructions on the form for paragraph 1.c.  I mistakenly thought I did\nnot have to list any offenses where the fine was less than $150.  I submitted a\nstatement to your agent during my interview.  The incident in paragraph 1e was an\noversight on my part.  I had completely forgotten about this until I was interviewed\nby your agency.  I was interviewed by [DSS Agent] about a year ago and also\nsubmitted a statement.\nAt his hearing, Applicant explained when he filled out his SF 86, he \u201chad quite a bit of other\nthings going on at the same time.\u201d  He said he it took him a week to fill out the form.  Tr. 38-39.  He\nstated he had previous experience filling out a security clearance application when he applied for a\ntop secret clearance with the Army Reserve in 1988.  Tr. 39-40.  At his hearing, Applicant reaffirmed\nhis response to the SOR that he \u201cmade a mistake.\u201d  Tr. 38-46.  Applicant did list his April 2002 DUI\narrest on his SF 86.\nIn conjunction with Applicant\u2019s background investigation for his security clearance, he was\ninterviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Special Agent in March 2006.  The OPM\nSpecial Agent testified at Applicant\u2019s hearing that she asked him during the interview whether he ever\nbeen arrested and he replied \u201cno.\u201d  Knowing this was not accurate, she confronted him about the April\n2001 and October 2002 arrests, which he did acknowledge and stated he misunderstood the question.\nIt was her \u201cimpression\u201d during the interview that Applicant was not being honest about his criminal\nhistory at the beginning of the interview, but after being confronted, \u201cthen he came forward and talked\nabout his two unlisted arrests.\u201d  Tr. 81-85.\nApplicant\u2019s Army National Guard Platoon Leader testified on his behalf.  He gave very\nfavorable testimony about Applicant and considers him to be an asset to the Guard.  Tr. 110-122.  He\nalso was his senior rater on one of his enlisted evaluations.  AE E.  Applicant submitted four reference\nletters.  AE A through D.  One of the letters was from a Captain and another was from a Sergeant\nFirst Class, both from the Army National Guard.  The remaining two letters were from a long time\nfriend and a co-worker.  All four of these individuals were very supportive of Applicant.  Applicant\nalso submitted six performance evaluations reflecting above average performance in the Army\nNational Guard.  AE E through J.  The same is true for two evaluations from his civilian job.  AE K\nthrough M.\nPOLICIES\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n3\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n5\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction\nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the\nDirective.  An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known\nas the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful\ndecision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant adjudicative guidelines are set forth\nand discussed in the Conclusions section below.  Since the protection of the national security is the\nparamount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the\nissuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation\nor conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n3\ngovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a potentially disqualifying\ncondition under the Directive. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\n\n?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable,\n4\n[evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and [decides]\nwhether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App.\nBd. July 6, 2006). \n6\nclearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  Security clearance\ndecisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 30 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning criminal conduct stating,\n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.\u201d\nTwo Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions raise a security concern and is disqualifying\nin this case: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offense,\u201d and an \u201callegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted.\u201d  Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  The remaining Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions\ndo not apply.  \u00b6\u00b6 31(b), (d), (e) and (f).\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s evidence establish the facts as alleged in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by falsifying answers to question\n26 of his 2005 SF 86.  I find that he deliberately falsified his answer to question 26.  I do not find his\nexplanation that he misunderstood the question or made a mistake to be credible in light of his age,\n\nSee generally, e.g. ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (Although the passage of three years\n5\nsince Applicant\u2019s last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel the Judge to apply CC 1, as a matter of law, the\nJudge erred by failing to give an explanation why he did not apply that mitigating condition.\n7\neducation, past experience, and the fact that he understood the remaining questions and was able to\nto provide accurate and truthful responses to include an April 2002 DUI arrest.\nFor a violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material.  The Supreme\nCourt defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S.. 506, 512 (1995) as a statement\nhaving a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making body to\nwhich it is addressed.\u201d  See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d.547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).\nIf Applicant had provided an accurate answer to Question 26 of his SF 86, this accurate\nanswer is capable of influencing the Government to deny his security clearance.  His arrests are\nsufficiently numerous and recent and serious to jeopardize his application for a security clearance.\nHis omission from his 2005 SF 86 is material.  Accordingly, Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c) apply to SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.\nGuideline \u00b6 32 provides for potentially applicable criminal conduct mitigating conditions:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures\nare no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and,\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nGuideline \u00b6 32 does not provide a \u201cbright line\u201d rule for determining when a crime is \u201crecent.\u201d5\nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d\nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged\ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  Id.  Applicant\u2019s\nSOR-alleged and established conduct consisted for five separate arrests spanning a six-year period,\nfour of which involved physical altercations.  These offenses taken as a whole are sufficiently\nnumerous, serious and recent to preclude application of Guideline \u00b6 32(a).\nApplicant knowingly, deliberately and voluntarily chose to omit the information about his\narrest.  He also plead guilty to five separate criminal offenses.  There is no evidence he was pressured,\nforced or coerced to commit any of the offenses alleged.  Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and (c) do not apply. \nGuideline \u00b6 32(d) does not apply because there is an absence of or limited evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation.  There is no evidence of counseling or therapy to change his behavior and\n\nAdministrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d  ISCR Case 02-\n6\n03186 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006).  Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to present documentary\nevidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d  ISCR Case 01-20579 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004) (holding\nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative evidence may be used in common sense evaluation to\ndetermine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are established).  In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the\nAppeal Board explained:\nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of evidence, lack of\ncorroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence suspect, unreliable, or incredible. .\n. .  Evidence that lacks corroboration must be evaluated in terms of its intrinsic believability and in\nlight of all the other evidence of record, including evidence that tends to support it as well as evidence\nthat tends to detract from it.\nIn ISCR Case No. 04-08934 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2006) the Board stated an applicant\u2019s statements about\n7\nhis or her intent and state of mind when an SF 86 or SF 85P was executed were relevant but not binding information.\nMoreover, an applicant\u2019s statements are considered in light of record evidence as a whole.  Id.  \u201cThe security concerns\nraised by an applicant\u2019s falsification are not necessarily overcome applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.\u201d\nSee ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).\u201d  Id.\n8\navoid the factors and stressors that led to the criminal offenses.  The best evidence Applicant\nsubmitted suggesting successful rehabilitation is that he plead guilty to all five offenses.  His failure\nto present more corroboration about his rehabilitation from mental health professionals, co-workers,\nneighbors, family and friends is a factor in this decision.   While Applicant\u2019s \u201cgood character\u201d\n6\nevidence is impressive, it did not address the underlying behavior or motivation that led him to\nbecome involved in four physical altercations requiring law enforcement intervention and one arrest\nfor DUI within a relatively short period of time while a mature adult.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nUnder Guideline \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving . . . lack or candor [or] dishonesty . . . can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the . . .\nclearance process . . . .\u201d  One personal conduct disqualifying condition is particularly relevant and is\ndisqualifying in this case.  Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides, \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification or relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\nApplicant gave an incorrect anser on question 26 of his 2005 SF 86.  The evidence of record\nestablishes deliberate falsification.  The question clearly asks an applicant to list all arrests not\notherwise specified in the last seven years.  Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude his intent\nwas to conceal the information about his two arrests in April 2001 and October 2002.7\nGuideline \u00b6 17(a) to (e) provides for five Guideline E mitigating conditions potentially relevant to this\ncase:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or\nsignificantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel\n\n9\nor legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the\nsecurity clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate\nor provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change\nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and\nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur; and,\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n           Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and (b) are not applicable because Applicant did not \u201cmake a prompt, good-\nfaith effort to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts,\u201d and he did not assert anyone advised him not to provide the information about his arrests.\n          Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) to (e) are not applicable because: (1) Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SF 86\nis serious, and it casts doubt on his \u201creliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment;\u201d (2) he has not\n\u201cobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior;\u201d and\n(3) he has not disclosed \u201cpositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\n          In addition to the facts discussed in the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\nI have considered the general adjudicative Guideline related to the whole person concept under\nGuideline \u00b6 2(a).  As noted above, Applicant\u2019s five arrests over a six-year period while a mature adult,\nfour or which involved physical altercations, is a sufficiently serious problem to raise a security\nconcern.  His actions with respect to criminal conduct and falsification of his SF 86 were\nknowledgeable and voluntary.  The motivation for his failure to list his April 2001 and October 2002\narrests was to conceal past criminal conduct.  These facts, taken as a whole, cast doubt on his\nreliability and trustworthiness.\n          Applicant presented some extenuating and mitigating evidence.  There is no doubt he has\nachieved some significant accomplishments as it pertains to his Army National Guard service and his\ncivilian employment.  However, it is unfortunate that he did not address or get to the core of the\nunderlying behavior which prompted his five arrests.  It is difficult to comprehend how Applicant\ncontinued to find himself in situations leading to four unprovoked altercations requiring law\nenforcement intervention.\n         In sum, however, the likelihood of recurrence remains because insufficient evidence was\npresented about improvement in his overall personal behavior, and ability to avoid future\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n8\n10\nconfrontation.  He did not receive any professional counseling, and he may not have a clear perception\nof how he arrived at his current situation, and he may not understand how to avoid problematic\nsituations in the future.  The minimal evidence he presented of rehabilitation is insufficient to resolve\nmy doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.\n          After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\npertaining to criminal and personal conduct.  The evidence leaves me with doubts as to his\ntrustworthiness, eligibility and suitability.\n         I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518\n(1988), my \u201ccareful consideration under the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n8\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guidelines.  Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s\ncase.  For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n          Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n                   Paragraph 1, Guideline J:                   AGAINST APPLICANT\n                        Subparagraphs 1.a. - 1.f.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 27, married and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Technical Management. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Test Engineer, and he seeks to retain a Top Secret-level DoD security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony. Paragraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. 1.a. The Applicant has consistently denied being arrested on November 26, 1999, for a Public Peace Offense. He submitted his DD-214, which shows that he was on an overseas tour with the Army on that particular date. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C; Transcript at 16-17.) 3 1.b. The Applicant admitted receiving Non-Judicial punishment in the Army in 2002 for having a fight with a fellow soldier. He was sentenced to perform extra duty. According to the Applicant, this was one of three fights he has had in his life. (Transcript at 17-18, 30-32.) 1.c. In 2002, the Applicant missed a court date for a traffic citation and a warrant for Failure to Appear was issued. In November 2002 he was arrested ",

ROSS\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nThe Applicant has a history of minor criminal and dishonest conduct, primarily related to\ndriving offenses.  The majority of this conduct occurred between 2002 and 2004.  The Applicant has\ntaken responsibility for his conduct, changed his attitude about the law, and has presented persuasive\nevidence that he is now eligible for a security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 15, 2006, and requested a\nhearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on February 7, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on February 16, 2007.\nA hearing was held on March 15, 2007, at which the Government presented three\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called one additional witness,\nand also submitted three exhibits.  The transcript was received on April 5, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 27, married and has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Technical Management.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Test Engineer, and he seeks to retain a Top Secret-level DoD\nsecurity clearance previously granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based\nupon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer\nto the SOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.\n1.a.  The Applicant has consistently denied being arrested on November 26, 1999, for a\nPublic Peace Offense.  He submitted his DD-214, which shows that he was on an overseas tour with\nthe Army on that particular date.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C; Transcript at 16-17.)\n\n3\n1.b.  The Applicant admitted receiving Non-Judicial punishment in the Army in 2002 for\nhaving a fight with a fellow soldier.  He was sentenced to perform extra duty.  According to the\nApplicant, this was one of three fights he has had in his life.  (Transcript at 17-18, 30-32.)\n1.c.  In 2002, the Applicant missed a court date for a traffic citation and a warrant for Failure\nto Appear was issued.  In November 2002 he was arrested on this charge.  He subsequently paid a\nfine and the charge was dismissed.  The Applicant admitted he was at fault for missing the court date\nand avers that such an occurrence will never happen again.  (Transcript at 19-20, 34-36.)\n1.d.  The Applicant\u2019s next involvement with the police happened in October 2003 when, after\na traffic stop, he was arrested for Driving on a Suspended License.  The Applicant avers that he did\nnot know his license was suspended for having too many driving infractions.  However, the\nApplicant testified, \u201cI went to Court and pled guilty to driving with a suspended license and I was\ngiven five days in jail, in which I served three and I did pay my fine.\u201d  (Transcript at 20-21, 36-37.)\n1.e.  On November 2, 2004, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Reckless Driving\nand Evading a Police Officer.  He pled Guilty to the Reckless Driving Charge, for which he received\na $761 fine and 36 months informal probation.  The probation will expire in April 2008.  The\navailable evidence indicates that this incident was not as serious as the charges indicate.  (Transcript\nat 21-25, 38-42.)  It is also clear that the Applicant made a point of notifying his employer of the\nincident so they could properly notify the Government.  (Government Exhibit 2.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because his conduct showed questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n2.a.  The Applicant was working as a bagger at a grocery store in 1998.  He freely admits that\nhe used extremely poor judgment when he stole some grocery items from his employer.  He was\nterminated for this incident.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 20; Transcript at 25-27, 43-44.)\n2.b.  The Applicant used marijuana twice, in 1997 and August 2002.  The August incident\nhappened after the Applicant had been discharged from the Army, but his security clearance was still\nactive.  The Applicant did not know that his security clearance was still active at that time.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A; Transcript at 27-28, 46-48.)\n2.c.  The Applicant\u2019s conduct, set forth under Paragraph 1, above, will be viewed under this\nGuideline as well.\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant received an Honorable Discharge from the Army in 2002.  During his service\nhe was awarded the Army Achievement Medal twice and also the Good Conduct Medal.  He is very\nproud of his service to the nation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A; Transcript at 45-46.)\nThe Applicant submitted evidence showing that he is successful at work.  He has recently\nbeen granted a promotion and is viewed as an \u201cimportant part of the operation.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits B and C.)\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\n\n5\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in criminal acts, or other incidents, that demonstrate poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has been involved in several criminal incidents over several years (Guideline J); and\nthat this conduct, along with other acts not criminal, indicates poor judgment, untrustworthiness and\nunreliability by the Applicant (Guideline E).  \nUnder Guideline J the following Disqualifying Conditions apply: 31.(a) a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses; and 31.(d) individual is currently on parole or probation.  The\nfollowing Disqualifying Conditions are also applicable concerning the Guideline E allegations:\n16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports\na whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information; and 16.(d) credible adverse\ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by\nitself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited\nto consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\n\n6\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nApplicant has, by his own admission, acted in an irresponsible manner on occasion when he was a\nyoung person.  Three of the incidents occurred in 2002 and 2003.  The Applicant has only had a\nminor traffic offense since November 2004, the date of his last arrest.  He remains on informal\nprobation until April 2008, but from his testimony and other evidence, it is clear that he has matured\nand will engage in such acts in the future.  It is particularly worthwhile to note that the Applicant\nmade a point of keeping his employer notified of the judicial process of the 2004 case.  Based on the\nevidence, the following Mitigating Conditions apply: 32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity; remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.  Paragraph 1 is found for the\nApplicant.\nTurning to Guideline E, the Applicant admits that he used poor judgment in using marijuana\ntwice and in stealing groceries from his employer when a teenager.  It is obvious from the available\nevidence that his involvement in such minor offenses is an aberration on the part of the Applicant\nand will not be repeated.  Mitigating Condition 17.(c) applies: the offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or\ngood judgment.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nIn addition, application of the General Factors is appropriate and supports a decision in the\nApplicant's favor.  Several of the acts occurred because the Applicant was young and immature.  He\nis older and his testimony shows that he has matured in knowing his responsibilities as a security\nclearance holder (factor (4)).  The Applicant shows considerable evidence of rehabilitation (factor\n(6)), he is motivated to not engage in such conduct in the future (factor (7)), and, under the\ncircumstances of this case, there is little to no likelihood of continuation or recurrence of the conduct\n(factor (9)).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of\nthe Government's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA submits under Guideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant deliberately falsified his June 2, 2005, e-QIP by failing to disclose in response to question 21 that he had consulted with two health care providers in spring 2005 about a mental health related issue (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he had falsified material facts to an investigator in January 2006 when he indicated that in August 2005 he had been evaluated by a counselor after his spouse complained to police that he wanted to hurt himself, but had not sought out any mental health counseling. Applicant denied the allegations. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old electronics field engineer, who has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since September 1998 (Item 5).

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: John W. Bonney, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 2, 2005. On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E that provide the basis for its decision to deny\nApplicant access to classified information. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 22, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 5, 2008, and requested a decision without a hearing. On\nApril 7, 2008, the government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting\nof eight exhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\nJuly 3, 2008\n\n2\ninstructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. On May 23, 2008, Applicant\nsubmitted his rebuttal to the FORM consisting of an affidavit from his spouse (Ex. A), to\nwhich the government did not object. On June 9, 2008, the case was assigned to me to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. Based on a review of the government\u2019s FORM and\nApplicant\u2019s response, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA submits under Guideline E, personal conduct, that Applicant deliberately\nfalsified his June 2, 2005, e-QIP by failing to disclose in response to question 21 that he\nhad consulted with two health care providers in spring 2005 about a mental health\nrelated issue (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he had falsified material facts to an investigator in\nJanuary 2006 when he indicated that in August 2005 he had been evaluated by a\ncounselor after his spouse complained to police that he wanted to hurt himself, but had\nnot sought out any mental health counseling. Applicant denied the allegations. After\nconsideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 49-year-old electronics field engineer, who has worked for his\ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, since September 1998 (Item 5). He has been\nmarried to his spouse since March 1990, and they have one adopted daughter who was\nborn in March 2001 (Item 5, Item 7).\nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Navy from April 1978 to April\n1998 (Item 6). He held various levels of security clearance up to top secret (Item 8). In\nDecember 1984, he was awarded non-judicial punishment for possession of marijuana\n(Item 4, Item 5, Item 8) while he held a confidential-level security clearance (Item 8). He\nhad a history of marijuana use that intensified when he was in the service but he ceased\nhis drug use after the non-judicial punishment (Item 8). In about 1987, he was briefly\nhospitalized after becoming despondent on the breakup of a relationship (Item 7). On a\nDoD Personnel Security Questionnaire (DD Form 398) completed on October 26, 1987,\nApplicant checked off \u201cYes\u201d to question 20d [\u201cHave you ever been a patient (whether or\nnot formally committed) in any institution primarily devoted to the treatment of marital,\nemotional, psychological, or personality disorders?\u201d] but provided no detail. He listed his\nnon-judicial punishment for marijuana possession in response to questions 21a (any\narrests or charges) and 21b (any convictions) (Item 4).\nApplicant\u2019s performance ratings suffered in the short term following his non-\njudicial punishment, but he restored his good standing in the military (Item 8) and was\nawarded several medals and commendations for his active duty service, including two\nNavy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, three meritorious unit commendations,\nthree good conduct medals, Navy and Armed Forces Expeditionary Medals, NATO and\nNational Defense Service Medals, and a Southwest Asia Service Medal. In April 1998,\nhe was granted an honorable discharge from active duty at the rank of petty officer first\nclass after 20 years (Item 6). After he retired from active duty, Applicant worked as an\n\nThe credentials of this mental health professional are not documented in the record other than he is referred\n1\nto as \u201cDr. [name omitted].\u201d It is not clear whether he is a duly qualified psychiatrist, although he is a medical\nprofessional since he prescribed an antidepressant for Applicant (see Item 8).\nApplicant told a government investigator that his sessions with the mental health professional were in the\n2\nspring 2005 (Item 8). Yet, his spouse indicated that she began seeing the marriage counselor in April or May\n2005 (Ex. A). Applicant\u2019s sessions with the physician were at the referral of the marriage counselor, so they\nlikely  would have been in late spring at the earliest.  Neither the government nor the Applicant presented any\nproof as to the specific dates of his two sessions. Conceivably, they could have occurred after he completed\nhis e-QIP although Applicant never raised it as a defense to the government\u2019s allegation of falsification.\n3\nelectronics technician installer for a local federal contractor from May 1998 until he\nstarted with his present employer in September 1998 (Item 5).\nSometime in spring 2005, Applicant and his spouse began experiencing marital\nproblems around child-rearing issues. His spouse began to see a marriage counselor\nwithin a psychotherapy practice in April or May 2005 (Ex. A). Believing it would help\ntheir marriage, she told Applicant that she would leave him if he did not attend also.\nApplicant went to two sessions with the marriage counselor sometime that spring. At the\ntherapist\u2019s referral, Applicant also consulted with a mental health professional on two\noccasions.  (Item 7, Item 8, Ex. A).  Applicant took a prescribed antidepressant for only\n1\ntwo days as he did not like its effect on him (Item 8).\nOn June 2, 2005, Applicant completed an e-QIP on which he responded\nnegatively to question 21, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you consulted with a mental health\nprofessional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with\nanother health care provider about a mental health related condition?\u201d.  Applicant\n2\ndisclosed on his e-QIP that he used marijuana in the service from 1982 to 1984 while he\nheld a security clearance, and that he had been awarded non-judicial punishment in\nDecember 1984 (Item 5).\nIn July or August 2005, Applicant argued with his spouse. After he told her that\nshe would like it better if he was not around, his spouse called the police and reported\nApplicant had expressed the desire to harm himself. The police called in a counselor\nfrom the community services board who determined he was fine. Nothing further came\nof it. Applicant was not required to make any follow-up appointments with the counselor,\nand was not prescribed any medications (Item 8).\nOn January 4, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator to\nverify the information on his e-QIP. Applicant volunteered that he had been evaluated at\nhis home by a community services\u2019 counselor in July or August 2005 after his spouse\nexpressed concern to the police that he might harm himself. Applicant related he had\nnot sought mental health related treatment on other occasions (Item 8).\nOn April 21, 2006, Applicant was contacted to obtain information about his\npreviously undisclosed sessions with the marital counselor. Applicant explained that his\nspouse began going to a psychotherapy practice on the advice of her primary care\n\n4\nphysician, and that at some point she told him she would leave him if he did not go also.\nMartial issues centered around the rearing of their daughter. Applicant indicated that in\nspring 2005, he had two sessions with the marital counselor and two consults with a\ndoctor on the referral of the marriage therapist. Applicant added he was prescribed an\nantidepressant that he took for only two days. When asked why he had not disclosed\nthese sessions on his e-QIP or during his previous subject interview, Applicant\nresponded he had forgotten about them (Item 8).\nOn July 30, 2007, Applicant underwent a mental health evaluation by a DoD\napproved psychiatrist at DOHA\u2019s request. Applicant told the psychiatric consultant that\nhe had been hospitalized briefly in 1987 after becoming despondent over the breakup of\na relationship, and had \u201cbrief contact\u201d with a mental health professional \u201cas a result of\nmarital issues, long since resolved.\u201d The psychiatric consultant opined that Applicant\u2019s\njudgment and reliability are good and likely to remain so (Item 7).\nIn response to the SOR allegations that he had deliberately concealed his mental\nhealth counseling, Applicant indicated in March 2008 his sessions were for marital\ncounseling only and not considered consultation for a mental health condition (Item 2).\nOn May 22, 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse signed an affidavit to the effect that Applicant\nvisited with the marriage counselor at her request and their benefit, and that he had no\nother interaction with counselors or psychiatrists except for the two occasions with the\ndoctor on the referral of the marriage counselor (Ex. A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant checked \u201cNo\u201d in response to question 21 on his e-QIP concerning\nwhether he had consulted with a mental health professional or another health care\nprovider about a mental health related condition. He also denied to a government\ninvestigator in January 2006 that he had sought mental health counseling when the\nevidence shows in late spring 2005 he had two sessions each with a marriage\ncounselor and with a doctor who prescribed an antidepressant for him. Applicant has\nconsistently denied that he intended to conceal that information, placing the burden on\nthe government to establish the willful intent required under disqualifying condition AG \u00b6\n16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\n\nIncluded in Item 8 is an \u201cinvestigator\u2019s note\u201d indicating that Applicant had been contacted on April 21, 2006,\n3\nto obtain information regarding the unlisted counseling with the marriage counselor. It is not clear that this was\nan in-person contact or that Applicant had any time to reflect on his responses. \n6\nresponsibilities,\u201d and AG \u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to any employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d \nIn April 2006, Applicant told a government investigator that he had not disclosed\nthe counseling sessions on his e-QIP or during his interview of January 2006 because\nhe had forgotten about them. The logical inference therefrom is that Applicant would\nhave listed the counseling sessions had he recalled them. Yet, in response to the\nfalsification allegations two years later, Applicant indicated the sessions were for marital\ncounseling and not sought out by him, inferring that disclosure was not required. A\nconclusion of deliberate falsification could warrant based on the inconsistency in his\nexplanations, but they must be evaluated in context and in light of the record as a\nwhole.  Based on the record before me, I am not convinced of the government\u2019s\n3\nposition that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the consultations \u201cwas deliberate and\nmotivated by a desire to steer the security investigation away from his psychological\ncondition\u201d (see FORM, p. 5). \nThe DoD\u2019s psychiatric evaluation indicates that Applicant is \u201cfree of psychiatric\nlabels,\u201d so the alleged motive is not established. There is no proof of an underlying\npsychological condition that Applicant would have wanted to conceal. While he\napparently had been hospitalized in the past and diagnosed with a \u201cCharacter Disorder,\nNOS\u201d (Item 7), Applicant did not conceal that hospitalization when he completed his DD\nForm 398 in October 1987. He responded affirmatively at that time to question 20d.\n\u201cHave you ever been a patient (whether or not formally committed) in any institution\nprimarily devoted to the treatment of marital, emotional, psychological, or personality\ndisorders?\u201d (Item 4). More recently, during his interview with the government\ninvestigator in January 2006, Applicant \u201cvolunteered\u201d that he had been evaluated by a\ncommunity services\u2019 counselor at the request of the police following an argument\nbetween him and his spouse in July or August 2005. Applicant is not likely to have\nvolunteered that information if he wanted to steer the investigation away from mental\nhealth issues.\nThe evidence fails to substantiate that Applicant considered his counseling in\n2005 to be other than marital-related. The DoD psychiatric consultant indicated in his\nreport of July 30, 2007, that Applicant had \u201c[a] brief contact with a mental health\nprofessional . . . as a result of marital issues, long since resolved\u201d (Item 7). The\ngovernment submits that even if Applicant regarded his counseling as marriage therapy,\nApplicant was still required to respond \u201cYes\u201d to question 21 on the e-QIP because the\nmarriage therapist and physician are mental health professionals. Yet, the instructions\non the form specifically exclude from the reporting requirement treatment information\nthat involved only marital, family, or grief counseling, not related to violence by him.\nGiven those instructions, Applicant could reasonably conclude that his counseling did\n\n7\nnot fall within the scope of question 21. Even the two sessions with the physician were\nat the referral of the marriage therapist and Applicant could reasonably have considered\nthem part of his marriage therapy since he had no ongoing relationship with the\nphysician. I am not convinced that Applicant appreciated the distinction between his\nmarriage counseling sessions and those with the physician who prescribed an\nantidepressant for him.\nTo prove Applicant\u2019s alleged lack of candor during his January 2006 interview,\nthe government offered an investigator\u2019s report of Applicant\u2019s unsworn declaration of\nthat date. Applicant affirmed in November 2007 that the report of investigator was\ninaccurate only to the extent it mis-stated the first name of his deceased father-in-law so\nhe does not dispute that he told the agent he had not sought out any mental health\ntreatment (\u201cSUBJECT HAS NOT SOUGHT MENTAL HEALTH RELATED TREATMENT\nON ANY OTHER OCCASIONS.\u201d Item 8). The statement was not shown to be false,\nsince Applicant did not seek out the counseling in spring 2005 for a perceived mental\nhealth issue. He complied with his spouse\u2019s request in order to save his marriage.\nApplicant exhibited no reluctance to discuss his counseling when contacted in April\n2006. The record as a whole does not warrant a finding of willful omission or\nconcealment, so neither AG \u00b6 16(a) or AG \u00b6 16(b) apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of candid\ndisclosure, including of previous drug use, a drug-related non-judicial punishment, and\neven hospitalization for a mental health issue. His failure to disclose four therapy\nsessions (two with a marriage therapist and two with a medical professional) was not\nwith intent to conceal or deceive. His subsequent disclosures to a government\n\n8\ninvestigator of the details of this counseling as well as of a July/August 2005 mental\nstatus evaluation show his representations can be relied on, and a recent evaluation by\na DoD psychiatric consultant confirms he does not suffer from any psychological\ncondition that could impact his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n__________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Federal Maritime\n\nSee Transcript at 157-165, referring to specific account manual, Manual 90-1, \u00b6 17.b.(1).\n2\nTranscript at 49-50, 55, 57, 85, and 141.\n3\n3\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nAs stated above, Department Counsel has challenged certain of the Judge\u2019s factual findings.\nThe Board will address these findings in its analysis below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  \u201cThe general standard is that a\nclearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interest of the national security.\u2019\u201d\nDep\u2019t of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred in finding that Applicant\u2019s conduct under\nGuideline K was mitigated.  Department Counsel states that the Judge found mitigation for the\nfollowing reasons: \u201c(a) the custodian was responsible for the account, (b) Applicant was not aware\nof the custodian\u2019s negligent handling of the account, (c) Applicant had not been notified by the\ncustodian that inquiries had been made about the status of the account, (d) the problem with the\n[particular] account happened once and did not recur, (e) Applicant had been improperly trained to\nhandle the [particular] account, and (f) Applicant responded favorably and now demonstrates a\npositive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities. . .\u201d  Department Counsel\u2019s\ncontentions have merit.\nWith regard to point (a), Applicant characterized her responsibility for the particular\nclassified account as minimal.  The custodian had primary responsibility for the account.  However,\nApplicant had responsibility for the account as the custodian\u2019s supervisor, the FSO, and as alternate\ncustodian.  As alternate custodian, Applicant had a duty to keep aware of the day-to-day activity of\nthe account in order to assume the duties of the account custodian, when necessary, without undue\ninterruption of operations.   There is considerable record evidence regarding the duties of a\n2\nsupervisor and an alternate custodian,  and Applicant herself admitted that her supervision was very\n3\nlax.  Transcript at 112-113.\n  \nWith regard to points (b) and (c), the Judge could reasonably find that Applicant was not\naware of the account custodian\u2019s negligent handling of the account  and that Applicant had not been\nnotified by the custodian that inquiries had been made as to the status of the account.  However,\nthose facts do not mitigate the security concerns of Applicant\u2019s actions.  The Board has held that an\napplicant in a position of supervision can be held accountable  for security violations resulting from\n\n4\na failure to properly supervise subordinates.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 89-0781 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb.\n23, 1993).  Applicant commented that she was to \u201cspot check\u201d the custodian\u2019s work.  Transcript at\n134.  As noted above, Applicant admitted that her supervision was very lax. \nWith regard to point (d), Applicant supervised the custodian of the account under discussion\nhere from mid-2001 to late 2004.  Transcript at 129, 146.  The Judge\u2019s decision lists multiple\nsecurity violations which occurred in that account during that period.  Decision at 3.  The record does\nnot support the conclusion that the negligent handling of the account happened once and did not\nrecur.  The violations were continuous and recurred until Applicant had moved to another position\nin the company and a new primary custodian had been appointed.\nWith regard to point (e), Applicant stated that she did not receive training for the specific\naccount at issue.  She had received security training, including refresher courses.  When Applicant\nbecame responsible for that specific type of sensitive account, she should have asked for training\nspecific to that type of account.   Applicant did not do so and did not try to familiarize herself with\nthe relevant directives.  Transcript at 132-133, 141.  This failure is related to her lax supervision and\nis not a cause for mitigation.\nAs to point (f), while there is some support in the record for the Judge\u2019s conclusion on this\npoint, there is much evidence to the contrary.  The Judge accepted many of Applicant\u2019s\ncharacterizations of the events at issue.  Some of those characterizations are contained in the points\nunder discussion here.  Applicant has attempted to minimize and rationalize her failures by placing\nthe blame on the account custodian or on her employer.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated\nthat she \u201cthoroughly disagreed with the disciplinary action and the wording of the adverse report,\nbut in an effort to move past this incident, I accepted the responsibility and disciplinary action.\u201d\nResponse to SOR at 3.  When questioned about her response to the report, Applicant stated that it\nwas \u201cnot only false and misleading, but libelous and bordered on the lines of defamation of\ncharacter.\u201d  Response to SOR at 3 and Transcript at 152-153.  The record evidence indicates neither\na favorable response to the incidents in question nor a positive attitude toward security duties.\nOverall, the Administrative Judge failed to plausibly interpret the record evidence as a whole.\n Applicant admitted to very lax supervision.  As an alternate account custodian and FSO, Applicant\u2019s\nduties were not \u201cminimal\u201d and required her to obtain knowledge about the account rather than\nmerely rely on what others reported to her.  The security discrepancies in that account involved\nsomething more than the one-time mishandling of protected information\u2013Applicant continuously\nfailed to accomplish her duties with respect to the account from 2001 until late 2004.  Applicant\u2019s\nmishandling of her duties contributed to the security violations noted by the Administrative Judge\non page 3 of the Decision and lead to her suspension by her employer.  Applicant had significant\nexperience as an FSO and when she acquired alternate custodian duties with respect to the  account,\nshe should have realized that she needed training specific to that account.  She failed to request it,\nand this contributed to her inadequate training.  While there is record evidence that Applicant is now\nmore reliable, there is also evidence that Applicant has not demonstrated a positive attitude by\ndownplaying her responsibility in the account\u2019s security errors.  Once it is established that an\napplicant has committed a security violation, she has \u201ca very heavy burden of demonstrating that she\nshould be entrusted with classified information.\u201d Such violations \u201cstrike at the heart of the industrial\nsecurity program,\u201d and the \u201cAdministrative Judge must give any claims of reform and rehabilitation\nstrict scrutiny.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 9 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001). Considering the\n\n\u00b6 16.(c): \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n4\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation;\u201d\n\u00b6 16.(d): \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be\nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information. . .;\u201d\n5\nburden on Applicant and the record evidence as a whole, it is not reasonable to conclude that\nApplicant mitigated security concerns under Guideline K. \nDepartment Counsel correctly notes another error which involves both the Judge\u2019s factual\nfindings and her conclusions.  The Judge stated in her factual findings that there was no compromise\nof security as a result of Applicant\u2019s actions.  Decision at 3.  However, the Judge later concluded that\nsecurity was compromised by Applicant\u2019s actions.  Decision at 6.  There is testimony in the record\nthat an agency determination of the existence of a security compromise is controlling.  Transcript\nat 34-35.  In this case, the agency determined that a compromise occurred.  See Government Exhibit\n4.\nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge erred by concluding that Applicant\u2019s conduct\ndid not raise security concerns under Guideline E.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The\nJudge quoted language from \u00b6\u00b6 16.(c) and 16.(d) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective to support her conclusion.   Because Applicant\u2019s actions under Guideline K were sufficient\n4\nto support a \u201cbasis\u201d for disqualification under Guideline K, the Judge concluded that there were no\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E in Applicant\u2019s case.  However, the Directive does not provide\nthat if conduct raises a disqualifying condition under a specific guideline, then that conduct is\nprecluded from consideration under any other guideline.  `As Department Counsel points out, the\nintroduction to \u00b6 16 states that the \u201c[c]onditions that could raise a security concern. . . include\u201d the\nseven listed subparagraphs, but are not limited to those seven conditions.  Moreover, the plain\nmeaning of \u00b6 16.(c) anticipates that the adjudicating official will reach a favorable determination,\nafter considering disqualifying and mitigating conditions, under another single guideline, but then,\nunder this paragraph, consider the same conduct applying a whole-person analysis, which could\nresult in an unfavorable determination.  The Board has held that an applicant\u2019s behavior may have\nsecurity significance under more than one Guideline.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-05072 at 6 (App.\nBd. Jul. 14, 2005).  While the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines may modify the interpretation\nof some Board precedents or preclude their application, the revision of Guideline E noted above does\nnot change the general principle stated in the above Board decision that behavior can have security\nsignificance under more than one Guideline.  The language of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nis consistent with this principle.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion not to consider the conduct under\nGuideline E in this case is erroneous.\nThe record evidence in this case does not support the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions.  The\nerrors discussed above render the Judge\u2019s decisions arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  The\ndecision is not sustainable.  \n\n6\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael D. Hipple   \nMichael D.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n2\nApplicant is a security manager for a defense contractor. She has worked with this contractor\nsince 2000 and has held a security clearance the entire time. Applicant negligently failed to follow\nsecurity requirements under the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. Personal\nconduct security concerns were raised as an issue, but none of the evidence raised separate security\nconcerns under this guideline. Applicant has mitigated handling protected information security\nconcerns. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 11, 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\n1\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  dated December 11, 2006, to Applicant,\n2\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected\nInformation) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised AG were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement dated December 27, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 26, 2007. The\ncase was assigned to me on July 31, 2007. By letter dated August 6, 2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney filed\na Notice of Appearance. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 6, 2007, scheduling the hearing\nfor August 21, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\noffered exhibits 1-4. Applicant offered exhibits A-D. All exhibits were admitted into the record\nwithout objection. At the hearing, the Government requested that administrative notice be taken of\nthe content of three documents (I-III) about the National Industrial Security Program. There being\nno objection, administrative notice was taken of those facts. The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nSeptember 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraph 1.a(1). Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a(2)\nand 2.a. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 34 years old and worked as a security manager for a defense contractor since\n2004. She has worked in other positions for this contractor since 2000 and held a security clearance\nthe entire period. She has approximately two and a half years of college.\n\nTr. 106.\n3\nId. 106-107.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, dated December 27, 2006..\n5\nTr. 34.\n6\n3\nOn December 12, 2000, Applicant was employed as a facility security officer. After\nretrieving a file from the safe, she failed to secure the safe, which contained classified information.\nThis action was a violation of paragraphs 5-100, 5-300, 5-302 and/or 5-303, and 5-308b of DoD\n5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), January 1995. On\ndiscovering the security breach, Applicant immediately reported the incident to her manager. No\nclassified information was compromised. As a result of this security breach, Applicant suggested\nrearrangement of the room so all staff \u201ccould see the containers [safes] before we left and we could\nsee if they were opened or if they were closed.\u201d  A checklist was also instituted so staff would initial\n3\nwhether the safes were closed and secure on leaving the room.  Applicant was counseled on this\n4\nmatter and an incident report was placed in her personnel file. Applicant stated that this act was not\nin any way intentional, deliberate, or willful.  \n5\nIn the late summer of 2004, Applicant was employed as the manager of the Security Office\nand supervised three staff members. One of her employees was the account manager and custodian\nof a COMSEC  (communications satellite) account. This employee had more than seven years of\n6\nexperience in managing COMSEC accounts. Applicant and her manager provided all the required\nresources and training in order for the custodian to adequately perform her duties. Applicant was the\nalternate custodian on the account. As the alternate custodian, Applicant\u2019s responsibilities were\nminimal.\nOn June 2, 2005, an Adverse Information Report was filed with the Defense Industrial\nSecurity Clearance Office to report that in the late summer of 2004, a change of custodian was\ninitiated for the DoD material in the COMSEC account. An investigation revealed the following\nsecurity violations:\n!COMSEC inventories for the years 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004 were not completed\nand forwarded to the NSA COR as required;\n!COMSEC keying material was reported as being destroyed, but was still on hand\n!COMSEC keying material was missing;\n!Superseded COMSEC keying material was not destroyed after super session as\nrequired;\n!COMSEC keying material was improperly stored;\n!COMSEC devices were not properly safeguarded.\nThe investigation revealed that Applicant\u2019s performance in handling the account reflected\na pattern of gross negligence and disregard of security requirements. Mismanagement of the account\ndid not compromise security. Applicant denied the allegations in the report. Applicant, as the\nsupervisor and alternate custodian, was unaware that the custodian employee had received several\nwritten notices and voice mails from the National Security Agency regarding the delinquent status\n\nId. at 128.\n7\nApplicant's Answer, note 3, supra.\n8\nId.\n9\nId.\n10\nId.\n11\nTr. 23.\n12\nEx.

Applicant stated:\n7\nI freely admit that while my supervisory oversight of this employee may have been\nconsidered lax, based on her level of experience, I personally did not feel that it was\nnecessary to micro manage this account; [the employee] was an experienced security\nprofessional and COMSEC custodian.8\nAs the supervisor, Applicant was held equally responsible for the security violations of her\nstaff member.  Applicant was suspended by her employer for one week without pay due to the\n9\nsecurity violations surrounding the COMSEC account. \nRegarding the security violations pertaining to the COMSEC account, the Government states\nthat Applicant violated personal conduct security standards, which are predicated on the security\nviolations alleged under Guideline K. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s behavior raises questions about her\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Applicant denied this\nallegation and stated:\nMy character and willingness and ability to appropriately safeguard our nation\u2019s\nclassified information has been brought into question. At no time during either my\nperiodic reinvestigation or the statements made in this response, have I ever\ndemonstrated a lack of candor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations or failure to provide truthful answers during a security clearance process.\nMy responses are truthful and candid.10\nApplicant submitted four character letters from colleagues. They all believe she is trustworthy\nwith unquestionable integrity. They all vouch for her character and endorse her application for a\nsecurity clearance.11\nThree coworkers, all with security clearances, testified as witnesses at the hearing. One\nwitness stated this about the custodian issue: \u201cShe [Applicant] was trusting someone to manage the\naccount and didn\u2019t verify that that account was being properly managed.\u201d  Two affidavits attesting\n12\nto Applicant\u2019s character were submitted at the hearing.  Both witnesses believe that she is loyal to\n13\nthe U.S. They both endorse her application for a security clearance.\n\nEx. A (Individual Performance Evaluation).\n14\nId.\n15\nTr. 26; see also, Ex.

For the performance period, January 1, 2006 to December\n31, 2006, Applicant received an outstanding in these categories: development, team work and\nprocess improvement, leads people, drives process improvement, and executes strategy and results.\nHer summary assessment was \u201coutstanding\u201d and her overall rating was \u201cexceeds requirements.\u201d14\nThe manager of the report noted:\n[Applicant] transitioned out of her role as Security Shared Services Manager into the\nrole of Security Manager, International Security and Crisis Management in June\n2006. Both programs were in major need of improvement and she accepted this\nchallenge with much enthusiasm. Although [Applicant\u2019s] knowledge of managing\ninternational and crisis management programs was limited she managed to bring\nherself up to speed very quickly through self-study and utilization of internal\ncompany expertise and resources.15\nIn December 2004, Applicant transferred to another position with the same defense\ncontractor. She requested a non supervisory position. In her new position, she has handled a\nCOMSEC account for two years without any incidents.16\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, and the whole-person concept, along with the factors\nlisted in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and\nsurrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n17\n\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The burden of proof is something less than a\n18\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n19\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.20\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.21\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n22\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n23\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n24\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n25\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nHandling Protected Information\nHandling protected information is always a security concern because \u201cdeliberate or negligent\nfailure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other sensitive information\nraises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to\nsafeguard such information, and is a serious security concern.\u201d (AG \u00b6 33)\nApplicant admits her self-reported failure to secure a safe containing classified information.\nMoreover, the record reveals that with regard to the COMSEC account, security was compromised\nbecause of the custodian\u2019s negligence and disregard of security violations. As the custodian\u2019s\nsupervisor and alternate custodian of the COMSEC account, Applicant was responsible and was\nsuspended for one week without pay. Consequently, Handling Protected Information Disqualifying\n\n7\nMitigating Conditions \u00b6 34(g) (any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information) applies.\nVarious factors can mitigate handling protected information security concerns. The incident\nregarding the safe occurred in 2000. Applicant self-reported this incident as soon as she realized that\nsecurity could have been compromised. As a matter of fact, she made suggestions, which were\naccepted, for rearranging the room, so others could avoid this mishap in the future. In the 2005\nCOMSEC incident, Applicant was the supervisor of the custodian of the account and the alternate\ncustodian. The custodian was responsible for the daily management of the account. As her supervisor,\nApplicant was expected to know how the custodian was handling the work. Unbeknownst to\nApplicant, the custodian was negligent in handling the account and had received inquiries about the\naccount\u2019s status without notifying Applicant. It happened once and did not recur. I conclude that\nHandling Protected Information Mitigating Condition \u00b6 35(b) (the individual responded favorably to\ncounseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the\ndischarge of security responsibilities) applies. Applicant stated she was improperly trained to handle\nthe COMSEC account. She relied on the custodian employee for informal training. Moreover, there\nis no evidence in the record to refute how much training she received. Thus, \u00b6 35(c) (the security\nviolations were due to improper or inadequate training) applies.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because \u201cconduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15)\nThe old adjudicative guidelines for Personal Conduct included as a potentially disqualifying\ncondition any \u201creliable, unfavorable information\u201d involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  That general language duplicated\nother guidelines, such as those for Criminal Conduct or Financial Considerations.  \nThe new adjudicative guideline for Personal Conduct has more limited language, however.\nUnder paragraph 16(c), a disqualifying condition may arise where there is \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under\nany other single guideline . . . .\u201d  Paragraph 16(d) applies where there is \u201ccredible adverse information\nthat is not sufficient to support action under another guideline . . . .\u201d  (Emphasis added.) \nIn this case, the basis for the allegations under the guideline for Personal Conduct was the\nevidence of breach of security violations for handling protected information. However, the security\nbreaches are sufficient to support a basis for disqualification under another guideline. Thus, none of\nthe evidence raises separate security concerns under the guideline for Personal Conduct.\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Applicant accepted responsibility for both incidents involving breach of security. As to the\n\n8\nsafe, she offered a suggestion that could benefit all staff by rearranging the room and instituting a\nchecklist so the safe would be seen and secured upon exiting the room. She accepted responsibility for\nnot supervising the custodian of the account more closely. Moreover, she asked to be relieved from\nsupervising in the future. For two years she has worked in a different capacity with a COMSEC\naccount without any security breaches. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the potential security\nconcerns arising from handling protected information. I find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline K (Handling Protected Information):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a(1):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a(2)\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nGary Rigney, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred approximately $24,000 in delinquent debt. Having developed no\nstructured plan to pay these debts, he has not  mitigated the security concerns raised under the\nfinancial considerations guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nGE 1(Security Clearance Application, dated April 6, 2005).\n2\nId.\n3\nTr. 29-30.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. On September 12, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized\nresponse to the SOR, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on October 2, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 31, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A-D) were admitted into\nthe record without objection. Applicant had two witnesses testify in his behalf as reflected in the\nhearing transcript. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs  1.c through 1. h in his SOR response under\nGuideline F. The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. Applicant denied allegations in\nsubparagraph 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e based on lack of sufficient information. After a complete review of\nthe evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of\nfact:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After he graduated from high\nschool in 1994, he married. In 1997, Applicant entered the military, but he received a hardship\ndischarge in 1998. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2000. He has worked for his current\nemployer since 2004.  On April 6, 2005, he completed his security clearance (SF 86) application.\n2\n3\nApplicant remarried in late 2000. As a result of that marriage he has one son. His second wife\nhas substance abuse problems. Unbeknownst to Applicant, she used cocaine and methamphetamine.\nHe and his wife separated because he did not want any part of this behavior. His wife left and\nApplicant\u2019s son stayed with him in approximately 2001. At the same time, Applicant started a\nflooring business. He was having financial difficulties with the business. He had great difficulty in\nmanaging his money.4\n\nGE 5 (Applicant\u2019s answer to Interrogatories, dated July 26, 2007).\n5\nTr. 30-31; AE A (Divorce Decree).\n6\nAE B, C, and D (Income Tax Forms 2006-2004).\n7\nTr.27.\n8\nTr. 40.\n9\nPersonal Financial Statement, dated 2007.\n10\n3\nThe flooring business did not do well. Applicant also had legal expenses in conjunction with\nhis separation and divorce. His self-employment did not produce an adequate income for him and\nhis son. During that time (2003), Applicant wrote checks and did not have sufficient funds in his\naccount to cover the checks. He does not dispute that he was charged with Fraud-Insufficient Funds\non four occasions from 2003 until 2005. He paid restitution on all of them.  \n5\nDuring the two-year period of separation from his second wife, Applicant had credit cards\nin both names. His wife continued to use them and the bills were not paid. Applicant tried to have\nan account closed at one point. However, she continued to use them. They did not have a separation\nagreement at the time. He also bought her a car a few days after they separated. They co-signed the\ncar note. The car was repossessed in 2002. Applicant called the company to see how much he owed\non the vehicle after it was sold. He did not receive any response from them.  In 2004, Applicant and\nhis second wife were finally divorced.6\nApplicant\u2019s income began to increase with his current job. In 2004, he earned $6,600. In\n2005, he earned $25,543 and in 2006, he earned $31,395. He has filed and paid his taxes.  He now\n7\nhas a stable, steady income. He has not incurred any new debt. He does not use credit cards.

He does\nnot require frequent direction and can be trusted in his position.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n13\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n14\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\n\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\u00b62 (a)(1)-(9).\n15\n Id.\n16\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n18\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n15\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n16\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.17\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n18\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n19\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n20\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.21\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $24,000. He admits many debts are still not paid. His 2007\ncredit report confirms his SOR alleged debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c)\n(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \n\n6\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). This does not apply because\nApplicant\u2019s debts from the SOR are as recent as 2005 and 2006. \nApplicant\u2019s debt resulted from his separation and divorce from his second wife. He also had\na business downturn in his flooring business. These are conditions that were largely beyond his control.\nTo fully satisfy 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. However, he\npaid other bills but did not actively pursue the debts listed in the SOR. The car repossession and the\nforeclosure were addressed somewhat, but Applicant did not continue efforts to resolve the debts. FC\nMC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant has not fully\nmet both requirements of 20(b).\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or under control) does not apply in this case. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) partially applies.\nApplicant called some of the companies but did not follow up in writing. He did not take an active\nstance to resolve his debts or seek protection in bankruptcy.  FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and\nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to\nresolve the issue) partially applies as well. Applicant did not have any documented proof to\nsubstantiate the disputed accounts. He was credible in that his second wife continued to use the credit\ncards, but he had a legal responsibility because they were in his name, and he did not act to remove\nher. \nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. There are not clear indications that the\nfinancial problem is being resolved or is under control.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant is a hard-working man who was honorably discharged from the\nmilitary in 1998. His second marriage created financial problems as his second wife accumulated debt\n\n7\nunder Applicant\u2019s name. This is the half of the debt listed in the SOR. He had a business downturn and\nsevere financial difficulty in 2003-2005. He has custody of his son and provides for him. He now has\na stable position and is current on his bills. He has made some good faith efforts to resolve his\ndelinquent debts, but not sufficient to meet his burden in this case. He was honest and candid at the\nhearing concerning his second wife\u2019s part in this matter. \nI considered his military experience, his service to the country, and the very favorable\nendorsement by his employer. After considering all the evidence, and particularly that Applicant has\nno structured plan to pay the delinquent debts, I find Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence\nof extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination.\nApplicant has not met his burden in this case. He has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under\nGuideline F. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:- 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

Following a\nnumber of years of occasional marijuana use, much of it while holding a security clearance, he tested\npositive for marijuana in March 2005 and was disciplined by his employer.

His deliberate understating and omissions of his marijuana use in his clearance\napplications were neither extenuated nor mitigated.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 14, 2006, and requested a hearing.  The case\nwas assigned to me on April 18, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on April 24, 2007.  The\nhearing was rescheduled for May 10, 2007.  A hearing was convened on May 10, 2007, for the\npurpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case\nconsisted of one witness and four  exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including (himself)\nand three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on May 25, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add an additional\nallegation 2.c under Guideline E to the SOR to allege Applicant falsified material facts in the\nsecurity clearance application (SF-86) he signed in January 2006 by deliberately failing to disclose\nhis drug use while holding a security clearance. For demonstrated good cause, Department Counsel\u2019s\nmotion to amend was granted.  Applicant admitted the added allegation with explanations about the\ndates of his use. \nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (a) used marijuana from 1985 until at least\nMarch 2005, (b) used marijuana while holding a security clearance, and (c) tested positive during\na random drug test in March 2005, after which he agreed to take part in an employee assistance\nprogram.  Under Guideline E. Applicant is alleged to have falsified the security clearance (SF-86)\nhe executed in July 2006 by understating his drug use, an falsified the SF-86 he executed in June\n2003 by omitting any drug use within the previous seven years. \n\n3\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations pertaining to drug use but\ndenied any intention to falsify either of the two SF-86 forms he completed.  In explanation, he\nclaimed to be in a rush to complete the January 2006 SF-86, and mistakenly typed in the wrong date\nof his last use on this application.  He claimed to have truthfully denied using any illegal drugs\nwithin the last seven years preceding his execution of his June 2003 SF-86 (last using marijuana as\na high school student in 1985). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\nApplicant is a 40-year-old production assistant for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s history of marijuana use\nApplicant is married and has three children (two sons and a daughter).  He  was introduced\nto marijuana in 1984, while he was still a high school student.  He continued using marijuana on an\noccasional basis until he was released from the Army Reserves in 1992 (R.T., at 32-33, 67-70).\nAfter assuring he did not use marijuana at all between 1992 and May 2004, he conceded to Agent\nA in a July 2006 interview that he used marijuana on a couple of occasions between 1992 and May\n2004 (R.T., at 70-71).  Asked about his use of marijuana in May 2004 by Agent A, Applicant\nindicated he twice smoked marijuana on two separate occasions in May 2004 at a party with friends\n(R.T., at 40-41, 49).  At the time, he held a security clearance (granted in November 2003) and was\naware he was subject to DoD\u2019s no-drug policy (R.T., at 79).  On these two occasions, he smoked\nmarijuana four to five times altogether (twice, or thereabouts, at each sitting). There is no evidentiary\nsupport for drawing inferences of his using marijuana or any other illegal drugs between May 2004\nand March 2005.\nIn March 2005, Applicant shared a marijuana cigarette with a friend and used the same\ncigarette four to five times.  He never reported his 2004 or 2005 marijuana use to his company\nfacility security officer (FSO), and by all accounts, he never notified anyone within his company of\nhis marijuana use (R.T., at 78).  The following week he was  randomly selected for a drug test and\ntested positive (see ex. 4).  As a consequence of his positive drug test, he was (a) penalized by his\nemployer with a loss of pay for three consecutive days, (b) referred to an employee assistance\nprogram, (c) required to meet with a substance abuse counselor for two months, and submit to\nrandom drug screening (see exs. 4 and A). By all accounts, he completed the conditions set by his\nemployer.  He completed his required counseling,  which included narcotics anonymous sessions\n(NA), before he returned to work (R.T., at 66, ).\nApplicant insists he has not used marijuana since his positive drug test, and has no intentions\nof using the drug in the future.  While he knows people who use marijuana, he doesn\u2019t associate with\nthem (R.T., at 65).  Given his history of recurrent marijuana use, however, his statements about prior\nand future use cannot be accepted at face value.\nApplicant\u2019s understatement and omissions of his marijuana use in his SF-86s\n\n In the SF-86 Applicant completed in June 2003, he also omitted his debts more than 180 and 90 days delinquent,\n1\nrespectively.   He later acknowledged delinquent debts in his follow-up interview with OPM agent in October 2003. Applicant\nprovides no explanations for his debt omissions.  While these debt omissions were not included in the SOR , they do affect\noverall impressions of his credibility.  \n4\nAsked to complete an SF-86 in January 2006, Applicant understated his marijuana use over\nthe previous seven years when answering question 27.  He listed only his 2004 marijuana use and\nfailed to list his more recent 2005 use.  When answering question 28, he answered in the negative\nto using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance (see ex. 1). \nInitially claiming he simply confused the years of 2004 and 2005, he later acknowledged that\nhe used marijuana in both 2004 and 2005.  Failing a random drug test just nine months before is not\nthe kind of incident that could reasonably be forgotten, and Appellant makes no claim to forgetting\nhis positive drug test, or his holding a security clearance at the time. His renewed claims that he\nconfused the 2004 and 2005 dates cannot be squared with his admitted use in both 2004 and 2005\nand cannot be considered plausible explanations (R.T., at 86-91).  Nor do his explanations account\nfor answering no to using marijuana while holding a security clearance.\nBesides understating his marijuana use in his 2006 SF-86, Applicant also omitted his\noccasional marijuana use in the SF-86 he executed in June 2003 .  Applicant attributed his omissions\n1\nto his confusion over the question.  Because he did not consider himself a user based on his\noccasional use of marijuana during the previous seven years, he claims could correctly answer no\nto questions 27 an 28  (R.T., at 79-82).  Applicant\u2019s claims cannot be reconciled with the plain\nmeaning of the questions, though, which ask whether he ever used illegal drugs within the previous\nseven drugs (marijuana included).  Applicant\u2019s claims represent strained interpretations that cannot\nbe considered credible explanations under all of the circumstances considered. \nTaken together, Applicant\u2019s understatement and omissions of his marijuana use while\nholding a security clearance and prior omissions of his occasional marijuana use during the 1996-\n2003 period reflect a pattern of knowing and wilful decisions on his part to withhold additional\nadverse information about himself.  Even with all of the positive input from his first line supervisor,\ntoo many doubts about his own credibility remain to accord any reasonable doubts about his\nintentions associated with his understatement and omissions. \nOver the course of two follow-up interviews in July 2005 with Agent A, Applicant\nacknowledged the extent of his marijuana use (beginning in 1984).  He was not initially forthcoming\nabout the extent of his use and had to be refreshed by Agent A with a report of investigation (R.T.,\nat 36-37).   Because Applicant had been very vague about the extent of his marijuana use, Agent A\nscheduled a second interview (R.T., at 37-38).  In this second interview, Agent A asked Applicant\nabout specific dates of use between 1992 and 2004.  He provided her more specific dates of use\nduring this time period, but declined to identify the friends who participated in his marijuana use\nduring this time frame (R.T., at 40).  Agent A continues to believe Applicant was evasive with her\nabout his marijuana use, but couldn\u2019t identify any specific instances of perceived dishonesty (R.T.,\nat 43). \n\n5\nApplicant is a highly regarded production assistant with his defense contractor.  His direct\nsupervisor (RH) assured he was familiar with the SOR and was aware of Applicant\u2019s positive drug\ntest and conditional counseling, and random screening that were required as conditions of continued\nemployment (R.T., at 103-04).  RH credits Applicant with successfully completing his employer\u2019s\nconditions and continuing his work as a valued , trusted member of his company team (R.T., at 104-\n07).  RH cites Applicant\u2019s acceptance of leadership assignments in his community as further\nevidence he has learned from his mistakes and is committed to avoiding any recurrence.     \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s\nwillingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social\nor occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninformation.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make\na common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of\nan applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those\ninferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant brings a praiseworthy civilian work record to these proceedings, in addition to a\nhistory of recurrent marijuana use.  Applicant\u2019s recurrent  involvement with marijuana over a twenty-\nyear period, coupled with his drug use understatement in the SF-86 he completed in January 2006,\nraise security significant issues about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required for\neligibility to access classified information.\nDrug issues\nWhile most of Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and other illegal substances occurred between\n1984 and 1992, some of acknowledged use is more recent (i.e., in 2004 and 2005) and was last\ndetected from a random drug test in March 2005.  Introduced to marijuana in high school, he used\nmarijuana occasionally between 1984 and 2005.\nApplicant's recurrent use of marijuana since 1984 (with some of his use occurring after he\nwas granted a security clearance in November 2003) are sufficient to invoke three of the\ndisqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs, i.e., 25(a) (any drug abuse), 25(b)\n(testing positive for illegal drug use),  and 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance). \nMisconduct predictions (to include return to illegal drug use), generally, may not be based\non supposition or suspicion.  See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356\n(April1998).  The Appeal Board has consistently held that an unfavorable credibility determination\nconcerning an applicant is not a substitute for record evidence that the applicant used marijuana since\nhis last recorded use, or based on his past use is likely to resume usage in the future.  See ISCR Case\nNo. 02-08032 (May 2004). But Applicant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana covers a wide spectrum of\ntime over a 20-year period and is sufficiently recent (admitted use in March 2005) and shielded\n(disclosed only by virtue of Applicant\u2019s positive drug test) as to raise legitimate questions over\nwhether he will return to using the substance within the foreseeable future.  \nTo his credit, Applicant has been able to inspire considerable confidence in his judgment and\nreliability from his supervisor of a number of years who knows him well and vouches for his\n\n7\ntrustworthiness.  Under a whole person assessment, Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s positive impressions\nare accorded considerable weight in making predictive judgments about his ability to avoid drugs\nin the future.  However, based on his history of recurrent use of marijuana over a prolonged period\nof time, recency of his last confirmed use, and the uncertainty that surrounds prospects for recurrent\nuse in view of his random positive test, Applicant is not in a position to invoke any of the mitigating\nconditions of the guidelines for drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s assurances that his marijuana involvement is a thing of the past are enough to\nenable safe predictions at this time that he will not return to marijuana use in the foreseeable future.\nConsidering all of the developed evidence of record, Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns\nassociated with his recurrent use of illegal substances.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect\nto sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.d of Guideline H. \nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for\nholding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s drug use\nunderstatements and omissions (i.e., of his marijuana use after being granted a security clearance in\n2003) in his January 2006 SF-86 and his less than definitive corrections of his historical use of\nmarijuana without refreshing reminders.  Agent A\u2019s overall impressions of the extent of Applicant\u2019s\nmarijuana use remained uncertain, even after completing to interviews with Applicant over a two-\nweek period.  So much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that\ntolerances for candor lapses are gauged very narrowly. \nBy understating and omitting his past involvement with marijuana in his clearance\napplications and initial statements in the first of his two 2006 OPM interviews, Applicant concealed\nmaterially important background information needed for the government to properly process and\nevaluate his security update.  His claims of confusing the dates of his use and not being a user lack\nsubstantiation.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his SF-86 understatement/omissions\nand ensuing OPM interviews, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the credibility necessary to avert drawn\nconclusions he knowingly and deliberately withheld material background information about his prior\nuse of illegal substances after being granted a security clearance.\nApplicant makes clear that he wanted to limit his reported marijuana use as much as he could\nplausibly reconcile with his stated view that he was not a user of illegal drugs.  His understatement\nof his drug use in his 2006 SF-86, omission of his drug use while holding a security clearance, and\nomissions of any drug use in his earlier 2003 SF-86 reflect narrow, but implausible reading of\nquestions 27 and 28 of the security application forms.  His understated and omitted usage in the\nrespective forms he completed were knowing, deliberate, and material to a determination about his\nclearance suitability.  They invite application of Disqualifying Condition (DC) for personal conduct\nof the Guidelines: 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) and 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative).  \n\n8\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to take advantage of the first\navailable opportunity afforded him to promptly and fully correct his SF-86 drug understatements and\nomissions before being confronted in his ensuing OPM interviews.  Not only has the Appeal Board\nfound the use of the predecessor Mitigating Condition (MC) to 17(a) of the Guidelines for personal\nconduct (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts) to be unavailing in circumstances (as here) where the applicant was first\nconfronted before he provided the relevant background information, but it has declined to apply the\npredecessor of 17\u00a9) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it has  happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  Compare ISCR\nCase No. 97-0289 (January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 1995).\n \nThere can be no doubt but that Applicant has inspired confidence and trust with his\nsupervisor who is familiar with his work and work ethics.  But in the face of his SF-86\nunderstatements and omissions, his favorable character evidence and positive professional\ncontributions alone are not enough to mitigate security concerns over his failure to be completely\ntruthful in his SF-86 submissions and ensuing OPM interviews without the need for being\nconfronted. \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the\nDirective (inclusive of the E2.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-\nparas. 2.a through 2.c of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE H (DRUGS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The Applicant can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  He is knowledgeable about\nhis security responsibilities, and shows that he can fulfill them.  Sufficient mitigation is shown.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 3, 2006, and requested a\nhearing (Answer).  The case was assigned to me on December 15, 2006.  The case was received by\nthe undersigned on December 22, 2006, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on January 5, 2007.\nA hearing was held on January 25, 2007, at which the Government presented one\ndocumentary exhibit.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted four hearing\nexhibits and one post hearing exhibit.  The Government also requested that Administrative Notice\nbe taken of certain adjudicative facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China.  The request for\nAdministrative Notice is marked Administrative Judge Exhibit I, and the documents attached to the\nrequest are marked as Administrative Judge Exhibits I(A) through I(D).  The transcript was received\non February 6, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43, married and has a Master of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant may have foreign connections which potentially make him vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or pressure.\n\n3\nThe Applicant was born in China in 1963.  He emigrated from China in 1986 in order to\ncontinue his studies in the United States.  The Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in\nJuly 1998.  His wife was also born in China, and she became a naturalized American citizen in May\n2004.  They were married in 1993, and have one American born daughter.  (Government Exhibit 1.)\nThey have between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000 in assets in the United States.  (Transcript at 50-51.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s brother became an American citizen in December 1991.  (Government\nExhibit 1 at question 10, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  His mother became an American citizen in October\n2005.  (Answer at 1, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  His father is still a citizen of China, but resides with\nthe Applicant and is a permanent resident of the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother in law and father in law are citizens of China and reside there.  They\nare both retired and have a pension income from a non-governmental company in China.  (Transcript\nat 43-44.)  The Applicant does not talk to them that often, at most once or twice a year.  (Transcript\nat 51-52.)\nSince becoming an American citizen, the Applicant and his family have traveled four times\nto China (2000, 2002, 2003 and 2005).  All of these trips were for vacations.  The first three occurred\nbefore the Applicant worked in the Defense sector.  Before his last trip, he followed company policy\nand filled out a \u201cPre-Departure Foreign Travel Form.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  In it, the Applicant\nstated that he was traveling to China and that his family would be meeting his in-laws.  The\nApplicant also took the precaution of specifically asking his Facility Security Officer (FSO) if there\nwere any security concerns connected to his visiting China.  The FSO states, \u201cI consulted with DSS\n[Defense Security Service] and was told that there were no restrictions on his travel to China, and\nthat there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.  Armed with this information [the Applicant] confidently made\nthe trip.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 4.)\nThe Applicant testified about what he would do if he was approached by a foreign\nintelligence service.  He stated, \u201cIf there was any threat that was caused by Chinese Government\nholding my parents-in-law as a threat for me to release secured - - classified information - - I will\nreport directly to the authority of the FBI, and I believe that our Government will protect me from\nthat.\u201d  (Transcript at 38.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\n\n4\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na.\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb.\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\nc.\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.\nThe voluntariness of participation\nf.\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\ng.\nThe motivation for the conduct\nh.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may have foreign connections or be subject to foreign influence that may\nlead to poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has foreign connections which could cause a security concern (Guideline B).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nApplicant\u2019s parents both live in the United States.  His mother is an American citizen.  The evidence\nshows that the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws in China is not terribly close.  It is difficult\nto call any family relationship \u201ccasual and infrequent,\u201d but this one comes close.  Finally, neither of\nhis wife\u2019s parents in China is an agent of that government or, in my opinion, in a position to be\nexploited by the Chinese government.  The possibility that the Applicant can be coerced by his in-\nlaws is virtually nil.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following Disqualifying Conditions\narguably apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b) connections to a foreign person . . . that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information;\nand (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nI have also considered the information concerning the intelligence activities of the Chinese\ngovernment provided by Department Counsel in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I and its\nattachments I(A) through I(D).  In addition to the items stated by the Department Counsel, I also note\nthe following in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I(D) at 21, \u201cThere is no evidence that the PRC\nconsiders Chinese-Americans to be more vulnerable to approach than any other group.\u201d\nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background:  7(a) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country\nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\n \n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd.

The totality of this Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, including the virtually non-existent potential\nfor exploitation, shows that he warrants a favorable finding under the whole person standard.\n  \nThe record shows that the Applicant has been a patriotic American citizen for many years,\nand has substantial financial assets in the United States.  Almost all of his immediate family are\ncitizens of the United States (especially his wife and child).  The Applicant is alert to the security\nconcerns presented by his particular circumstances and the responsibilities incumbent upon him.  The\nApplicant testified about the importance of his family in the United States, and his pride in being an\nAmerican citizen and a member of the defense industry.  Using the whole person standard, the\nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his foreign connections and is eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.2\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.

The Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China (China),\nbut he lives with the Applicant.  The remainder of the Applicant\u2019s immediate family and his brother\nare all American citizens.  His in-laws are citizens of China and reside there.  They are not agents\nof the Chinese government, or in a position to be exploited by that government.  The current nature\nof the Chinese government has been considered.  The Applicant can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  He is knowledgeable about his security\nresponsibilities, and shows that he can fulfill them.  Sufficient mitigation is shown.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn March 12, 2007, this Administrative Judge issued a Decision in this case finding that it\nwas clearly consistent with the national interest to grant the Applicant access to classified\ninformation.  The Government appealed this Decision and, on October 15, 2007, the Appeal Board\nof the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (Appeal Board) remanded the Decision to this\nAdministrative Judge stating that I \u201cdid not properly analyze Applicant\u2019s case in light of the political\nconditions within the PRC [China],\u201d and that my analysis did not \u201cadequately address the security\nconcerns raised by an Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives.\u201d  Finally, the Remand Order stated that I should\nmake \u201cmore complete factual findings and . . . analysis consistent with those findings.\u201d  (Appeal\nBoard Decision at 2.)\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43, married and has a Master of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant may have foreign connections which potentially make him vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or pressure.\nThe Applicant was born in China in 1963.  He emigrated from China in 1986 in order to\ncontinue his studies in the United States.  The Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in\nJuly 1998.  His wife was also born in China, and she became a naturalized American citizen in May\n2004.  They were married in 1993, and have one American born daughter.  (Government Exhibit 1.)\nThey have between $1,500,000 and $2,000,000 in assets in the United States.  (Transcript at 50-51.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s brother became an American citizen in December 1991.  (Government\nExhibit 1 at question 10, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  His mother became an American citizen in October\n2005.  (Answer at 1, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  His father is still a citizen of China, but resides with\nthe Applicant and is a permanent resident of the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother in law and father in law are citizens of China and reside there.  They\nare both retired and have a pension income from a non-governmental company in China.  (Transcript\nat 43-44.)  The Applicant does not talk to them that often, at most once or twice a year.  (Transcript\nat 51-52.)  \nSince Applicant's mother in law and father in law are citizens and residents of China, it is\nimportant to consider the status of China at this time.  China, the most populous country in the\nworld, is economically powerful, and is an important trading partner of the United States.  It is run\nby the Communist Party which controls all aspects of the Chinese government.  It has strong military\nforces, and has its own foreign-policy.  Although there has been some cooperation, there has been\n\n3\nmuch more conflict with the United States in the past.  China has an extremely large army, a\nsophisticated defense establishment, and space capability.  China has launched satellites, has ballistic\nmissiles, nuclear arms, and nuclear bombs.  Its diplomatic and military dispute with the Republic of\nChina (Taiwan), foreshadows a possible military conflict, which the United States opposes as a\nresolution of the conflict.  China has an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary\nkillings; detention or incarceration without notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest,\ndetention or exile; no right to a public, fair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of due\nprocess; restrictions on free speech, on religious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of\nassembly; and no rights of privacy - family, home or correspondence. \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services.\nThis is believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States.  It also tries\nto identify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and\nsometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.   However,\nI also note the following in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I(D) at 21, \u201cThere is no evidence that the\nPRC considers Chinese-Americans to be more vulnerable to approach than any other group.\u201d\nSince becoming an American citizen, the Applicant and his family have traveled four times\nto China (2000, 2002, 2003 and 2005).  All of these trips were for vacations.  The first three occurred\nbefore the Applicant worked in the Defense sector.  Before his last trip, he followed his company\npolicy and filled out a \u201cPre-Departure Foreign Travel Form.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  In it, the\nApplicant stated that he was traveling to China and that his family would be meeting his in-laws.\nThe Applicant also took the precaution of specifically asking his Facility Security Officer (FSO) if\nthere were any security concerns connected to his visiting China.  The FSO states, \u201cI consulted with\nDSS [Defense Security Service] and was told that there were no restrictions on his travel to China,\nand that there shouldn\u2019t be a problem.  Armed with this information [the Applicant] confidently\nmade the trip.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 4.)\nThe Applicant testified about what he would do if he was approached by a foreign\nintelligence service.  He stated, \u201cIf there was any threat that was caused by Chinese Government\nholding my parents-in-law as a threat for me to release secured - - classified information - - I will\nreport directly to the authority of the FBI, and I believe that our Government will protect me from\nthat.\u201d  (Transcript at 38.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\n\n4\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na.\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb.\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\nc.\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.\nThe voluntariness of participation\nf.\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\ng.\nThe motivation for the conduct\nh.\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may have foreign connections or be subject to foreign influence that may\nlead to poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\n\n5\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the granting of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has foreign connections which could cause a security concern (Guideline B).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nApplicant\u2019s parents both live in the United States.  His mother is an American citizen.  The evidence\nshows that the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws in China is not terribly close.  It is difficult\nto call any family relationship \u201ccasual and infrequent,\u201d but this one comes close.  Finally, neither of\nhis wife\u2019s parents in China is an agent of that government or, in my opinion, in a position to be\nexploited by the Chinese government.  The possibility that the Applicant can be coerced by his in-\nlaws is virtually nil.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following Disqualifying Conditions\narguably apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b) connections to a foreign person . . . that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information;\nand (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nI have also considered the information concerning the intelligence activities of the Chinese\ngovernment provided by Department Counsel in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I and its\nattachments I(A) through I(D).  \nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background: 8(a) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.; and (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country\nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006).\n1\n\u201c[Matters], such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an\n2\napplicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country, his or her social ties within the\nU.S., and many others raised by the facts of a given case can properly be factored in to a judge\u2019s evaluation\nof an applicant\u2019s worthiness for a security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5,\n2007).  (Citations omitted.)\n6\nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\nThe Applicant is a person who has shown over an extensive period of years his connections\nto the United States and his desire to be not only a good citizen, but a security aware citizen.  It is\nto his benefit that the Applicant shows an appreciation of the possible activities of the Chinese\ngovernment.  This is shown by his affirmative acts to make sure that his travel to China in 2005 was\nappropriate.  As has been stated earlier, his wife, daughter and mother are American citizens.  The\nApplicant has extensive financial ties to the United States.  Under the particular facts of this case,\nthe Applicant has shown that he has deep and longstanding loyalties in the United States.  Based on\nmy analysis of the facts, including a consideration of the espionage activities of the Chinese\ngovernment, I find that the Applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest.\u201d\n \n\u201c[A] Judge is not limited to Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions when deciding\nwhether an applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.\u201d   The application of the\n1\nDirective\u2019s General Factors to the Applicant\u2019s foreign connections, specifically relevant General\nFactor h, also justifies granting the Applicant a security clearance.  The totality of this Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, including the virtually non-existent potential\nfor exploitation, shows that he warrants a favorable finding under the whole person standard.\n  \nThe record shows that the Applicant has been a patriotic American citizen for many years,\nand has substantial financial assets in the United States.

This documented behavior raised personal conduct concerns that Applicant was unable\nto mitigate. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 15, 2003, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nJanuary 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n2\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer dated and notarized on February 6, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2007. On March 28,\n2007 Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR adding two additional allegations under\nGuideline E. At the hearing, Counsel for Applicant stated she had no objection to the Government\u2019s\nmotion, and the motion was granted. Tr. 10-12. On May 2, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing\nscheduling the case to be heard on May 30, 2007.  The hearing was held as scheduled. On June 8,\n2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT \n\nG E 1, supra n. 1.is the basis for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated.\n3\n3\nIn his reply to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 11 allegations listed in the January 19, 2007\nSOR under Guideline E. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. Also, at the\nhearing, Applicant admitted the two additional allegations alleged in the Amended SOR dated March\n28, 2007. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.  \nApplicant is 31 years old.  After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the Army\n3\nReserve in April 1995  under the Delayed Entry Program. Following an injury he received in a fight,\nhe was discharged from the Army Reserve in April 1996 under an Entry Level Separation. Tr. 53-54.\nIn January 1996, he was charged with recklessly endangering another person, criminal mischief, and\ncriminal conspiracy. He participated in a drive-by shooting incident where one of his accomplices\nopened fire on the home and automobile of an individual his accomplice \u201cdisliked.\u201d  Although\nApplicant had a loaded weapon at the time, he stated he did not fire his weapon during the course\nof this drive-by shooting, and no one was hurt.  Tr. 49-52. He was found guilty of criminal mischief,\nand as a result of his participation in this offense was ordered to pay $800 restitution, awarded\nprobation, and as part of an agreement with the court, agreed to enlist in the Army.\nIn November 1996, Applicant enlisted in the in the U.S. Army and served continuously until\nhe was honorably discharged in October 2003 as a Sergeant (pay grade E-5). His Military Occupation\nSpecialty (MOS) was 92Y20/Unit Supply Specialist (\u201cSupply Sergeant\u201d). AE B. He was awarded\na top secret clearance in February 1998, which he maintained throughout his service in the Army.\nHe estimates he has earned approximately 92 college credit hours while in the Army. Tr. 22.\nApplicant has been married since May 1998, and has two sons, ages three and one. His wife is a\nlibrarian by profession and is currently a stay-at-home mother. Applicant has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since March 2005 as a network engineer 1A.  Tr. 66-67. He seeks a secret security\nclearance as a requirement of his employment.  Tr. 67-68.\nFollowing Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Army, he sought employment with a government\nagency requiring sensitive compartmented information (SCI). That agency conducted an extensive\nbackground investigation and during the course of that investigation, disqualifying information was\nuncovered that lead to his being denied SCI access. GE 2. Applicant appealed that denial and the\noriginal denial decision was sustained. GE 3 through 6.\nThe following is a summary of undisputed disqualifying information uncovered in that\ninvestigation discussed supra which formed the basis for the majority of the SOR allegations. While\nApplicant was an Army Supply Sergeant holding access to SCI, he used marijuana and cocaine from\n1997 to 1998, and used marijuana again in July 2003. In May 1998, he was awarded nonjudicial\npunishment for altering a government requisition form in which he ordered a watch for personal use.\nHe was sentenced to 15 days extra duty and required to return the watch.  In 1999, he\nmisappropriated for personal use three computer chairs and a desk intended for turn-in and took them\nhome. \nIn 1999, Applicant redirected three government Mac G-3 computer systems to a friend that\nwere not inventoried. The computer systems were valued at $500 each. Between 1999 and 2001, he\n\n4\nmisappropriated for personal use RAM memory, CD Rom and/or floppy computer parts intended\nfor recycling or destruction. In 2002, he took home a classified hard drive marked \u201cSecret\u201d to use\nin conjunction with his personal home computer. After keeping the hard drive in his vehicle\novernight, he decided to return it with other hard drives scheduled to be destroyed.  In 2003, he\nmisappropriated a laser jet printer and a 110 volt power supply for personal use.  In 2003, he\nmisappropriated a CISCO Router Number 2530 valued at $800 for personal use. He arranged to\nreturn the CISCO Router to his Sergeant after his July 2004 security interview with another\ngovernment agency. Again, all the above occurred while Applicant held a Top Secret/SCI security\nclearance. \nHe admitted to falsifying his September 2003 SF 86 regarding past drug use by failing to\ndisclose his use of marijuana between 1996 and 2003, his use of cocaine between 1997 and 1998,\nand use of LSD, mushrooms and ecstasy in 1996. He also admitted to falsifying his September 2003\nSF 86 by denying past drug use while possessing a security clearance.\nApplicant accepted responsibility for his past conduct and suggested among other things that\nhe has matured, is a family man and home owner, and responsible for supporting his family. He\nsubmitted an impressive collection of documents that included reference letters, performance\nevaluations from his Army service and post-Army civilian employment, and various awards and\ntraining certificates.  AE A through X.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guideline[s]), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and\nMitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n \u201cSubstantial e vidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n4\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR\nCase N o. 04-11463 at 2 (App. B d. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing D irective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cT his is\nsomething less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\nconclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being sup p o rted by\nsubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal M aritim e Com m \u2019n, 383 U .S. 607, 620  (1 9 6 6).\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nW ashington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cT he Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable\n5\nand unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circum stances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the D irective, and decide[s] whether A pplicant ha[s] m et his burden of persuasion\nunder D irective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (App. B d. July 6, 2006). \n5\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of establishing\ncontroverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d  demonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that\n4\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying\ncondition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\nRevised Guidelines at 10-11 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).\n6\nDC 16(a) is \u201cdeliberate . . . falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire.\u201d\n7\nDC 16(c) is \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\n8\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\u201d\nMC 17(c) \u201c. . . so much time has passed . . .that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\n9\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nMC 17(d) \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior . . . or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n10\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\n6\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  a security concern typically exists when conduct\n6\nhas been identified involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations.  Such conduct can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process.\nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of personal conduct\nproblems. His history of personal conduct is a security concern because it includes a deliberate\nfalsification of relevant facts from his September 2003 SF 86,  and adverse information suggesting\n7\na cumulative pattern of inappropriate behavior and drug use that occurred while holding SCI access.8\nThe record clearly establishes these two disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received partial credit in mitigation when applying two Mitigating Conditions\nunder Guideline E. The third MC  has applicability because of the length of time that has elapsed\n9\nsince Applicant\u2019s last documented incident in 2003. The fourth MC  has applicability because\n10\nApplicant accepts full responsibility for his behavior and points to life changes suggesting that he has\nturned a positive corner in his life. These, however, are not enough to overcome the years of\nsubstandard behavior beginning in 1996 when he was convicted of criminal mischief prompting his\nentry into the Army and culminating with the his falsification of his SF 86 in 2003 seeking a security\nclearance. \nI recognize many of the documented incidents discussed supra  occurred when Applicant was\nrelatively young. Individually, some of these incidents could potentially be overlooked due to passage\nof time.  Collectively, they establish a troubling pattern that demonstrates Applicant engaged in\nbehavior far below that expected of a person holding access to SCI. Applicant was held accountable\non at least two occasions. The first occurred when he was arrested in 1996, prompting him to join the\nArmy, and the second in 1998 when he was awarded nonjudicial punishment. Both of these events\nfailed to make a sufficient impression on Applicant, and he continued engage in a substandard pattern\nof behavior spanning eight years.\n\nSee ISCR Case N o. 04-06242 at 2 (App. B d. June 28, 2006). \n11\n7\nI would like to accept Applicant\u2019s representation that he has turned around based on the fact\nhe is a family man, a responsible employee, a home owner, and has reached an acceptable level of\nmaturity. I am also confronted with the fact past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior.\nMost disconcerting is Applicant\u2019s conduct while he held to SCI. Having said that, if Applicant\ncontinues on his present course, he may well achieve a state of reform warranting favorable\nconsiderable consideration. Unfortunately, when weighing the record Applicant  established, I am not\nconvinced enough time has elapsed to demonstrate Applicant should be granted a security clearance.\nApplicant also receives credit for accepting responsibility and I am impressed with his\naccomplishments in the Army and his post-Army accomplishments. Verification of being drug-free\nwould have been helpful, especially in light of the number of drugs Applicant used. His egregious\nbehavior while maintaining a security clearance in the Army weighed heavily against him in assessing\nhis security eligibility under the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In short, Applicant failed when given the\nopportunity to decide between a right and wrong choice.\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the personal conduct security concern.  Likewise, he has not met his\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n11\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guideline. Applicant has not mitigated and overcome the government\u2019s\ncase. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1 - Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a - m:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor in the medical service field, has\nbeen employed since 2006 at $26,000 per annum. She worked as a civilian employee of the Army\nfor 21 years and held a security clearance for most of that time. She lost her job in 1992 for a medical\ndisability. During unemployment for 13 years she received a small annuity, workers compensation,\nand public assistance with very little income until becoming able to work and obtaining her present\nemployment. During this period, her income was never more than half her present income and often\nmuch less. She accumulated delinquent debts of approximately $46,000 which, through no fault of\nher own, she is unable to pay. She has now received credit counseling and has taken steps to file\nChapter 7 bankruptcy to resolve the delinquencies. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn April 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a trustworthiness determination for an ADP clearance for Applicant.\nDOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether such a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nOn May 21, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on June 20, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on July 19, 2007, for\na hearing on August 7, 2007, which was held that day. The government offered four exhibits and\nApplicant offered ten exhibits into evidence. All were accepted. The record was left open for two\nmonths for Applicant\u2019s submission of additional material. The transcript was received on August 20,\n2007. Three submissions consisting of one document each were made on September 13, 2007,\nOctober 10, 2007, and October 29, 2007. All were admitted in evidence without objection. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted seven of the 13 allegations of $46,000 in delinquent debts with\nexplanatory information for all of them. She denied or questioned six of the allegations with\nexplanatory information based on inadequate information or payments on some of the accounts. She\nappended to her answer documents relating to Chapter 7 bankruptcy which she is in the process of\nfiling. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 56-year-old customer service representative for a defense contractor health\nprovider. She obtained this employment in November 2005 and began work in January 2006. She\nhas a responsible position working with medical information for military personnel. Her work\ninvolves phone contacts with military personnel and their families regarding claims against insurance\ncompanies and health service providers. She is highly regarded by her supervisor for being a team\nplayer and following the company rules. She exhibits a high degree of integrity doing right by the\nbeneficiary, their family and her employer (Exh. J). She had been an employee of the Army for 21\nyears since 1971 before she was terminated for medical reasons in 1992. She was physically unable\nto work since she could neither walk or sit (Exh. A). She had held a security clearance years for\nalmost 20 years.\nUntil obtaining her present employment, Applicant was unable to work for approximately\n13 years for the diagnosed medical reasons. During this period of unemployment, she received some\nincome from various sources. Between 1992 and 1995 she received a government annuity of between\n$380 and $560 per month. In 1995, when the annuity ended, she received Workers Compensation\nuntil 2004 which paid her approximately $1,100 per month. Those payments ended in 2004, and she\nbegan receiving adult assistance from her state of residence of $200 per month. She continued to\nreceive this public assistance until January 2006 when she began her present work. It was during this\nlong period of low income and public assistance that Applicant\u2019s financial situation became acute\nleading to the accumulation of the delinquent debts at issue in this proceeding. \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts include two auto repossessions. The first was for $9,600\ncharged off in 2001. She paid $7,000 for the car two years before it was repossessed for missing\nthree payments. The second one for $3,400 was charged off in 2005. She attempted to notify the\nseller that she could no longer pay for it and it was not functioning. They had gone out of business\nso she still has the inoperable car. Also included is a foreclosure on the mortgage of a mobile home\nin 2001 for $22,400. She sold the home to a purchaser to get rid of it and he took possession of it but\ndid not make the payments. These three debts total almost $35,000 of all the debts alleged in the\nSOR. There has been no effort by any of these three creditors to collect from Applicant. \nA large number of the remaining debts totaling approximately $7,500 are for medical\nexpenses not covered by her insurance and, the largest two totaling $6,700, were incurred after losing\nher insurance coverage (SOR \u00b6 1. c.$172; 1. i.; $261; 1.l. ;$348; 1.o.; $2,400, and 1.p.; $4,384).\nSeveral others are for cash advances and bank delinquencies. (SOR 1.a $100; 1. b.; $300; 1.e. $118;\n1.f. $659; and 1.j. $801). The last two of these are questionable as to both whether the debt is owed\nand the amount at issue. \nThe remaining debts are for a state tax lien for $439 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) which Applicant has been\nmaking monthly payments since August 2007. Also included is lot rent of $800 (SOR \u00b6 1.k.) for her\nformer mobile home. She questions the amount and had offered payment of the amount she believed\nshe owed but it was rejected. She owes a cell phone bill for $303 (SOR \u00b6 1.n.).\nApplicant\u2019s present salary is $24,000 per annum with a take home pay of $968 every two\nweeks. Her expenses and rent payments are modest, but there is no way she could resolve the\ndelinquent debts on her present salary although she can avoid incurring further debts (Tr. 55 and 56).\nShe has saved funds to hire the credit counseling service which is required by persons petitioning\nfor bankruptcy, has paid them their fee, and is working with them. (Post-hearing submissions No.\n1 and 3, and Tr.16). She has been in contact with the bankruptcy court concerning the filing and\ninformation which she will submit to them. She does not have sufficient funds to employ an attorney\nbut, is working with the counseling service to file the bankruptcy petition herself. \nApplicant has an associate degree in medical administration with a minor in business. She\nenjoys her present work and is delighted to have employment after years of being on a variety of\nassistance after she became unable to work. She describes her situation now with what it has been\nas the difference between \u201cliving\u201d and just \u201csurviving\u201d. She is anxious to make certain she does not\nhave to go back on any form of public assistance and is motivated to make certain that does not\nhappen. She presented her evidence at the hearing in a systematic manner. I find that she is capable\nof taking care of the bankruptcy filing with the assistance of her counselor, and will do so for her\nown long term benefit as well as to insure she maintains her present employment.\nApplicant has been separated from her husband for 16 years.

In Executive Order 12968, Access to Classified Information, \u00a7 3.1(b) (August 4,\n1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only\nto United States citizens \u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to\nthe United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound\njudgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness\nand ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified\ninformation.\u201d  \nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to\nsensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with\nthe interests of national security.\u201d DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline. \n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d DoD 5200.2-R,\nAppendix 8. An administrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and\ncarefully weigh the available, reliable information about the person. Id. An administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Id.  \nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive\n5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be made. DoD 5200.2-R, \u00b6 C8.2.1.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.14. Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden\nof demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations. \nA person granted access to sensitive information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment. The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to sensitive information. The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance or a trustworthiness determination is not a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant. Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n\n5\nguidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts cited in the SOR prompted the allegation of security concern\nunder Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), since an individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c), or evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\n(AG \u00b6 19 a). \nMitigating Conditions (MC) might include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (AG \u00b6 20 b), and the person has received\ncounseling and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (AG\n\u00b6 20 c). There is sufficient evidence that the delinquent debts resulted from conditions beyond her\ncontrol. She was unemployed for 13 years during which time her payments from three separate\nsources during various periods were inadequate to support even a modest standard of living. During\nthat period she had annual income of between $2,400 and $12,000. It was during the period of her\nlowest income that she incurred a great number of the debts. As a result, she incurred debts that\nbecame delinquent which she could not resolve. She now has sufficient income from her\nemployment to live a modest life without the need for government assistance. She has taken the\nnecessary preliminary steps to resolve the delinquent debts through bankruptcy. I am confident she\nwill do so and is capable of following through on the bankruptcy. While this is not the preferred\nsolution for debts, it is the only solution available to her in view of her limited means. Thus, both\nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to sensitive  information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the process for adjudicating trustworthiness determinations is the\nfair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to\nsensitive information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the\ntotality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis. \nApplicant impressed me at the hearing as a proud and competent person who is hard-\nworking and diligent. She is delighted to once again be employed in a job where she is well\nregarded for her work skills and diligence. Her delinquent debts accumulated as a result of her un-\nemployment for 13 years which resulted in a loss of control of her finances. She now has a good\njob which pays over twice the amount she received in her best years during the period of\nunemployment. She is a valued and trusted employee of her present employer\n\n6\n. \nApplicant held a security clearance for almost 20 years during her government employment,\nand, thus knows the requirements imposed on those who hold a security clearance and can be\nexpected to observe the requirements for protecting sensitive information. With her present\nemployment and her strong desire not to return to public assistance, there is a strong likelihood of\nsuccess in effective management of her finances. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude in favor of the grant of a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n2\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 7, 2004, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nFebruary 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nAG  was provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement dated March 1, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 6, 2007. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 11, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 24, 2007,\nscheduling the hearing for May 15, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. At the hearing,\nthe Government offered five exhibits, Exs. 1-5. Applicant did not offer exhibits. All exhibits were\nadmitted into the record without objection. Prior to the hearing, the Government requested that\nadministrative notice be taken of the content of nine documents about Russia for administrative\nnotice. At the hearing, these documents were not objected to and they were admitted into the record\nand marked as Admin. Exs. 1-9. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 24, 2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND THE STATEMENT OF REASONS\nAt the hearing, the Government moved to amend subparagraph 1.d of the SOR as follows:\n1.d  You were taken into custody by the Russian police during a visit to Russia in\napproximately August 1996 after taking pictures of a bridge in Rostov-On-Don. You\nwere interrogated by the Russian Federal Security Service and asked if you would be\nwilling to work for Russia. You agreed but stated you would not do anything that was\nillegal.\nPrior to the hearing, the Government submitted a Motion to Amend the SOR. Pursuant to\nsubparagraph 2 of the SOR, allegations 2. b and 2.c are added:\n2.b  You falsified material facts on an SF 86, Security Clearance Application,\nexecuted by you on January 7, 2004, in response to Question 14 \u201cYour Foreign\nActivities \u2013  Contact with Foreign Government,\u201d which asks: \u201chave you ever had any\ncontact with a foreign government, its establishments (embassies or consulates), or\nits representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S., other than on official U.S.\nGovernment business?\u201d (Does not include routine visa applications and border\ncrossing contacts.).

He did not\nobject to the newly added subparagraphs 2. b and 2.c. Accordingly, the SOR is amended as stated\nabove.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d, 2.b, and 2.c.\nThose admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the factual allegation under\nsubparagraph 2.a. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 46 years old and is a U.S. citizen and resident. He works as a computer network\nadministrator for a defense contractor since 2001. He has held a security clearance in the past. \nFrom June 1995 to August 1995, Applicant participated in a summer language program at\na state university in Moscow.  He had a scholarship sponsored by an American group of teachers of\n3\nRussia.  In 1996, he received a master\u2019s degree in mathematics from a well-known university in the\n4\nU.S.5\n\nId. at 13.\n6\nId. at 14.\n7\nId. at 14.\n8\nId. at 15, 38.\n9\nEx. 2 (Applicant\u2019s Statement, signed on December 14, 1999) at 3.\n10\nId.\n11\nId.\n12\nTr. 16, 28; Ex. 2, note 11, supra, at 4.\n13\nEx. 2, note 11, supra, at 5.\n14\nFrom September 2000 to September 2001, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law lived with him and his wife in the U.S.\n15\nEx. 3 (Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, signed on June 12, 2002, Attachment: Foreign Born Relatives and\nStatements). \n5\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Russian citizen. They were married in the U.S. in 1995. She applied for\nU.S. citizenship about two and one-half years ago.  Their son was born in the U.S. He is not a dual\n6\ncitizen because his mother has not applied for citizenship for him in Russia. Applicant and his wife\nhave no plans to get dual citizenship for their son, who is now seven years old.\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s niece is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant has never met his\nwife\u2019s niece.  His wife has two friends in Russia and both are also citizens and residents of that\n7\ncountry. He stated that his wife was born in Russia and does have lifelong childhood friends there.8\nAfter graduating from college in 1996, Applicant went to Russia for the summer to stay with\nhis future spouse and her mother.  Out alone one day, after taking photographs of a railroad bridge,\n9\na police car stopped and asked for his identification and papers.  He was informed that recently a\n10\nlaw had been passed making it illegal to take pictures of strategic objects and places, including\nbridges, railroads, government buildings, and officers.  He was taken to a substation for further\n11\nquestioning. He was released, but his camera and passport were taken. He was instructed to report\nto the Office of  VISA and Registration of Foreigners Office the next day, when he was interrogated\nby the Russian Federal Security Service (RFSS) and asked if he would be willing to work for Russia.\nHe agreed but stated he would not do anything that was illegal.  At this meeting, his camera and\n12\npassport were returned. He was told not to inform Moscow or American Embassies nor his family\nand friends, including the U.S. government, about the meeting.  After this incident, he stayed in\n13\nRussia for another three to four weeks. He was not contacted again by the RFSS while in Russia or\nback in the U.S.  He stated this about why he agreed to work for the RFSS:\n14\nIf I say [sic] no, then things could have gotten \u2013 potentially could have gotten worse\nfor my wife and family that I had living there at the time, namely my mother-in-law\nand brother-in-law, who have since passed away.15\n\n6\nApplicant falsified material facts on a SF 86, executed by him on January 7, 2004, in\nresponse to Question 14 (Your Foreign Activities \u2013  Contact with Foreign Government,\u201d which asks:\n\u201chave you every had any contact with a foreign government, its establishments (embassies or\nconsulates), or its representatives, whether inside or outside the U.S., other than on official U.S.\nGovernment business?\u201d (Does not include routine visa applications and border crossing contacts.).\nHe answered \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed in the remarks section that between July 1, 1996 and September\n1, 1996, he had contact with the Russian Federation, Russia, in the following manner:  \u201cTravel visa\nto Russia for June 96 until October 1996: Stayed with my future wife, [name], an [sic] her mother,\n[name].

While relations between the\ncountries improved after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1990, there are issues that remain\ncontentious, including Russia\u2019s support of the Iranian nuclear program. Russia has assisted the U.S.\nin mediating international conflicts and is an ally in the war on terrorism. While its human rights\nrecord has improved since the demise of the Soviet Union, violence and human rights abuses are\nagain on the rise. The U.S. State Department cautions Americans traveling to Russia that there\nremains a heightened potential for terrorist attacks, although Americans are not being specifically\ntargeted.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\na person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.

The Government\n16\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n17\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n18\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.19\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.20\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n21\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n22\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n23\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n24\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nForeign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist for an individual with divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests. While Russia\u2019s human rights record has improved since the demise of the Soviet\nUnion, violence and human rights abuses are again on the rise. The U.S. State Department cautions\n\n7\nAmericans traveling to Russia that there remains a heightened potential for terrorist attacks.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Russia. Consequently, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition \u00b6\n7(d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship crates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercision)\napplies.\nApplicant\u2019s wife visited Russia while her mother was alive. Applicant\u2019s wife has a niece and\nfriends living in Russia. Applicant\u2019s wife, friends, and niece could be exploited by the Russian\ngovernment. They all could potentially pose a potential security threat and are in a position likely to\ncreate a heightened risk of exploitation by the Russian government. Consequently, Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Condition \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion)\napplies.\nIn response to a question on his 2004 SF 86 dealing with contact with a foreign government,\nApplicant deliberately omitted information, in an attempt to mislead, the material facts that he was\nasked by the Russian police if he would be willing to work for them and he agreed to do so. Thus, \u00b6\n7(g) (unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, associate, or employee of a foreign\nintelligence service), \u00b6 7(h) (indications that representatives or nations from a foreign country are\nacting to increase the vulnerability of the individual to possible future exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion), and \u00b6 7(i) (conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S.,\nwhich may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country) apply. None of the available Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions\napply. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question whether the\nperson\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified\ninformation. While visiting Russia, Applicant was asked by the Russian police if he would be willing\nto work for them, and he agreed to do so. However, he intentionally omitted those material facts on\ntwo questions on his 2004 SF 86. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar for used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) and \u00b6 16 (e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information\nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that\nis legal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or\npressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other group) apply. None of the available\nPersonal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply. Accordingly, allegations 2.a through 2.c of the SOR\nare concluded against Applicant.\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\n\n8\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Based on his past conduct, Applicant cannot be trusted to resolve any conflict of interest with\nhis wife, a citizen of Russia, her niece and friends living in Russia, in favor of the U.S. Moreover, he\nagreed to work for the Russian police in order to protect them. He omitted material facts about his\nactivity in Russia on his SF 86. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the potential security concerns\narising from foreign influence and personal conduct. I find that it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n1The SOR actually listed 16 debts, but the Judge found that two debts had been listed twice.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 12, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record.  On June 17, 2009, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable\ndecision.\nSome of Applicant\u2019s assertions on appeal rely on matters not contained in the record below.\nAs such, the assertions are based on new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on\nappeal.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nThe Judge found that there was no evidence of any payment on ten of fourteen overdue debts\nlisted in the SOR,1 and that the full amount of these debts was still owing.  The Judge also found that\nthree other overdue debts had outstanding balances despite some evidence of payments, and one debt\nwas disputed.  The Judge additionally found that Applicant had been in contact with many of the\ncreditors to work out methods for repayment.  The Judge concluded that while Applicant had begun\nthe process of resolving the overdue debts, little evidence had been offered to establish that any of\nthe debts had been resolved or even reduced.  The Judge also concluded that it is too soon to make\na determination that Applicant will follow through on his agreements to resolve his debts.\nTherefore, the Judge found the financial concerns unmitigated.\n  \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that he has made every effort to show his willingness to satisfy\nhis debts, and has made some reductions since 2005.  He also states that conditions resulting in his\nfinancial problems were largely beyond his control, such as loss of employment, court expenses and\na relationship separation.  These assertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as\na whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions\nin a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at\n3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\n\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He concluded that the evidence in mitigation was of insufficient strength to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the\nrecord. \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJune 17, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SCA), on September 26,\n2005 (Item 4). On March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted a reply to the SOR (RSOR) in writing signed on March 25,\n2009 (Item 3), in which he requested that his case be decided on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nOn April 24, 2009, Department Counsel issued the Department's written case. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant. In the\nFORM, Department Counsel offered 12 documentary exhibits (Items 1-12). Applicant\n\n2\nwas given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on May 30, 2009. Applicant submitted\ntimely an additional two page document, which has been marked as Item 13, and\nentered into evidence without objection.  The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on June 11, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access\nto classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the FORM, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 31 year old employee of a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 16 allegations (1.a. through 1.p.) regarding financial difficulties,\nspecifically overdue debts, under Adjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be\ndiscussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,393. In Item 3,\nApplicant\u2019s RSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation, adding that \u201cthis debt will be\nincluded in a financial plan provided with the debt counselor and or paid off using the\n401k cash withdrawal.\u201d No further evidence was submitted to establish that any\npayment has yet been made on this debt. At this time I find that the entire debt is still\nowing.   \n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,120 for past taxes.\nIn Item 3, Applicant admitted this allegation, adding that \u201cthis debt will be included in a\nfinancial plan provided with the debt counselor and or paid off using the 401k cash\nwithdrawal.\u201d No further evidence was submitted to establish that any payment has yet\nbeen made on this debt. At this time the entire debt is still owing.   \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $803. In Item 3,\nApplicant admitted this allegation, adding that \u201cthis debt will be included in a financial\nplan provided with the debt counselor and or paid off using the 401k cash withdrawal.\u201d\nNo further evidence was submitted to establish that any payment has yet been made on\nthis debt. At this time the entire debt is still owing.   \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,243.  In Item 3,\nApplicant admitted this allegation, adding that \u201cthis debt will be included in a financial\nplan provided with the debt counselor and or paid off using the 401k cash withdrawal.\u201d\nNo further evidence was submitted to establish that any payment has yet been made on\nthis debt. At this time the entire debt is still owing.   \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $130. In Item 3,\nApplicant denied that he is indebted to this creditor, and he indicated that he has\nrequested an investigation of Equifax on March 24, 2009. I find that Applicant is\ndisputing this bill at this time. \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $787.  In Item 3,\nApplicant admitted this allegation, adding that on March 25, 2009, he made a payment\narrangement with this creditor to settle the debt for three monthly payments of $131.17\neach, starting on April 3, 2009. A letter from this creditor, dated March 25, 2009,\nconfirming this agreement, was included with Item 3.  No evidence has been submitted\nto establish that any payment has yet been made on this debt. At this time the entire\ndebt is still owing.   \n \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,448.  In Item 3,\nApplicant denied that he is indebted to this creditor in the amount stated. He explained\nthat he has maintained bi-weekly payments of $57.45, and has reduced the debt to\n$1,079, and he indicated that this payment plan will remain in effect until this debt has\nbeen paid off in seven to 10 months. He also stated that this creditor has agreed to\nsettle the debt for the amount of $648.35 in two payments, with the first payment due by\nMarch 31, 2009. A letter from this creditor, dated March 24, 2009, confirming this\nagreement, and showing the amount still outstanding is $1,079.89 was included with\nItem 3.  However, it is not clear from Item 3, whether Applicant plans to make the two\npayments or follow the seven to 10 payment plan. At this time I find that $1,079.89 is\nstill owing to this creditor.\n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $265. In Item 3,\nApplicant admitted this allegation, adding that on April 3, 2009, this debt would be paid\nin full. No evidence has been submitted to establish that any payment has yet been\nmade on this debt. At this time the entire debt is still owing.    \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,205.  In Item 3,\nApplicant admitted this allegation, adding that he made a payment of $120.05 to this\ncreditor on March 26, 2009, and that a payment arrangement has been made to resolve\nthis debt by making payments of $54.23 to pay off this debt in no more than 10 months.\nNo evidence has been submitted to establish that any payment has yet been made on\nthis debt. At this time the entire debt is still owing.    \n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,748, for a state tax\nlien.  In Item 3, Applicant admitted this allegation, adding that the actual balance on this\ndebt is now $4,038.32, and he has made an agreement of bi-weekly payments of $60. A\nletter from this state tax board, dated March 24, 2009, confirming this agreement, and\nshowing the amount still outstanding is $4,038.32 was included with Item 3. No\nevidence has been submitted to establish that any payment has yet been made on this\ndebt. At this time the entire debt is still owing.    \n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,132. In Item 3,\nApplicant denied this allegation, stating that this is the same debt as that listed in 1.j.,\n\n4\nabove. After reviewing the debts, I find that this is the same debt as that listed and\ndiscussed in 1.j., above, and it is only owing one time.\n1.l. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,210. In Item 3,\nApplicant admitted this allegation, adding that the actual balance on this debt is now\n$2,428, and he has made an agreement of bi-weekly payments of $50, commencing on\nApril 3, 2009, until the debt is paid in full. No evidence has been submitted to establish\nthat any payment has yet been made on this debt. At this time the debt in the amount of\n$2,428 is still owing.    \n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $80. In Item 3,\nApplicant denied this allegation, stating that this debt was paid online in the amount of\n$90.37. No evidence has been submitted to establish that any payment was made on\nthis debt. At this time, I cannot conclude that this debt has been resolved.    \n1.n. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,715. In Item 3,\nApplicant denied this allegation, stating that the actual balance on this debt is now\n$8,194.96, after his repossessed vehicle, was sold at auction for the amount of $1,500.\nA letter from this creditor, dated December 6, 2008, confirming that $8,194.96 is still\noutstanding, was included with Item 3.  At this time, the stated debt of $8,194.96 is still\nowing.    \n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,428.  In Item 3,\nApplicant denied this allegation, stating that this is the same debt as that listed in 1.l.,\nabove. After reviewing the debts, I find that this is the same debt as that listed and\ndiscussed in 1.l., above, and it is only owing one time.\n1.p. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $21,171.87, owing to\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  In Item 3, Applicant denied this allegation, stating\nthat the actual balance on this debt for taxes owed for tax years 2004 and 2005 is\n$7,325.88, and that he has $75 withdrawn from his paycheck bi-weekly to pay off this\ndebt. A letter from the IRS, dated March 18, 2009, confirming that $7,325.88 is still\noutstanding, and he is to pay $150 a month, was included with Item 3.  At this time, the\nstated debt of $7,325.88 is still owing.\nIn Item 3, Applicant cited the primary reasons for his significant overdue debts:\nthey included loss of employment in February 2005, and his being charged with a\nmisdemeanor in 2003 that required him to pay court costs, lawyer fees, and 12 months\nof counseling. Additionally, he also cited a separation in 2007 and the loss of a tenant\nfor a home that he was renting out. \nAppellant stated that he plans to sell a home that he owns, which will provide him\nwith money to pay off some of these debts. He also plans to make an early withdrawal\nof funds he has in a 401k, which he avers now has a balance of approximately $10,500.\n\n5\nApplicant did submit a letter from the Security Operations Officer (SOO) of his\nemployer (Item 13). The SOO acknowledged Applicant\u2019s financial problems, but\ndescribed him in laudatory terms as  \u201chonest, trustworthy, dependable, hard working\nand pays attention to detail.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information. \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: Mitigating\nCondition (b) could be argued to be applicable, since some of Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties occurred because of a loss of earning and his separation. \nHowever, while I find that Applicant has now begun the process of resolving\nthese overdue debts, as stated above very little evidence has been offered to establish\nthat any debts have actually been resolved or even reduced.  It is simply too soon to\nmake a determination that he will follow through on his agreements to resolve these\ndebts. Additionally, no evidence was introduced to convince me that Applicant\u2019s is\ncurrent on all of his more recent debts, nor can I conclude that Applicant will not have\nmore financial problems in the future. \n I find that Applicant has not yet mitigated the financial concerns, and no\nMitigating Condition applies. It is too soon to determine that he is more financially sound\nand better prepared for future contingencies.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\n        Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on the reasons cited above\nas to why no Mitigating Condition applies, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nsignificant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n         Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.p.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n         In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In 2003, she attended inpatient\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Item 5.\n2\n Item 4.\n3\n2\ntreatment and received a diagnosis of opioid dependence, cannabis dependence, and sedative abuse.\nShe has not met her burden to mitigate the concerns raised under drug involvement. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. \nOn December 26, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant elected to\nhave her case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file\nof relevant material (FORM) on January 29, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on January\n27, 2006, and received on February 4, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections\nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant timely responded.\nDepartment Counsel had no objection. The case was assigned to me on February 22, 2007. \nOn March 15, 2007, it was discovered that Applicant was not provided a copy of the revised\nAG, effective September 1, 2006. On March 16, 2007, a copy of the revised AG was sent to\nApplicant along with an order allowing her 30 days to review the revised AGs and to submit\nadditional comments or documents. On March 27, 2007, Applicant faxed in an acknowledgment that\nshe received the revised AG.  After 30 days of receipt, no additional documents were submitted.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 25-year-old office administrator employed with a defense contractor. She\nsubmitted a security clearance application on October 20, 2005.   She admits to all of the allegations\n2\nin the SOR with the qualification that her last drug use occurred in September 2003.3\nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use.  Between February 2000 and September 2003, she\nused heroin on a daily basis. She also purchased heroin. From May 2001 to September 2003, she\nused marijuana on various occasions. During this time, she would purchase anywhere between $20\n\n Id.  \n4\n Item 6. \n5\n Item 6 at 2, Discharge Diagnosis, dated October 13, 2003.\n6\n Response to FORM, undated but timely submitted. \n7\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n8\n3\nto $100 worth of marijuana on a weekly basis. In 2001, she used the following drugs on at least one\noccasion: crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstacy, and acid.4\nOn December 30, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Drug\nParaphernalia. She was found guilty and fined $222, placed on two years probation, and ordered to\nattend mandatory drug classes.  \nBetween September 15, 2003, and October 2003, Applicant attended in-patient treatment at\na drug counseling facility.  She received a diagnosis of opioid dependence, cannabis dependence, and\nsedative abuse.   She made excellent progress while in residential treatment. Part of her treatment\n5\nplan was to continue out-patient treatment. After leaving residential treatment, she declined out-\npatient treatment because she did not think she needed to continue treatment.  The drug counseling\nfacility unsuccessfully discharged Applicant because continued out-patient treatment was one of the\nrequirements for her to have successfully completed the program.6\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant indicates that she has abstained from alcohol and drugs\nsince completing the in-patient program. She no longer associates with her drug using friends. In her\nresponse to the FORM, she indicated that she did not realize that she was unsuccessfully discharged\nfrom the treatment program. She denied out-patient treatment when she went back to school and\nwork. She attended weekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings for six months after completion of in-\npatient treatment. She no longer attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings due to the demands of the\ncollege courses she takes.  She achieved a 3.93 Grade Point Average during the fall quarter 2006.7\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n8\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive and the revised AGs, effective September 1, 2006.  The revised AGs set\nforth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 24. \n9\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2.\n10\n Id.\n11\n Id.\n12\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n13\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n Directive \u00b6 E.2.2.2; Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n15\n4\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement:  Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.9\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n10\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following\n11\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n12\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a). \nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n13\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.14\n\u201cAny doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n15\n\n AG, \u00b6 24(b).\n16\n5\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline H.\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nApplicant's past drug abuse raises a security concern. Drug abuse is defined as \"the illegal use\nof a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.\"  Between\n16\n2000 to September 2003, Applicant used illegal drugs on a daily basis. The drug involvement security\nconcern is heightened further by her diagnosis during her September 2003 in-patient treatment of\nopioid dependence, cannabis dependence, and sedative abuse.\nThe following Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) apply to Applicant's case.\nDI DC \u00b625(a) (any drug abuse) applies due to her past history of illegal drug use. DI DC \u00b625 (c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) applies.  Applicant possessed and purchased\nillegal drugs on numerous occasions over a four year period. One can reasonably conclude that she\npossessed drug paraphernalia as well based on her December 2002 arrest for drug paraphernalia and\nsubsequent conviction. \nDI DC \u00b625(e) (evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program) cannot be applied.  While\nApplicant was diagnosed as drug dependent during her in-patient treatment, the record is not clear\nthat the evaluation or diagnosis was made by a licensed clinical social worker.\nDI DC \u00b625(f) (failure to unsuccessfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a\nduly qualified medical professional) cannot be applied for the same reason that DI DC \u00b625(e) cannot\nbe applied.  Although, the treatment facility concluded Applicant's discharge from the program was\nunsuccessful, the record is not clear that treatment program was prescribed by \"a duly qualified\nmedical professional.\" \nThe drug involvement concern can be mitigated. However, I find none of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  Applicant has an extensive history of illegal drug use. She was diagnosed as opioid\nand cannabis dependent. Although she has indicated she does not intend to use illegal drugs in the\nfuture, it is too soon to conclude that she will follow through on her  intentions. This conclusion is\nbased on Applicant's extent of illegal drug abuse; her refusal to attend out-patient treatment against\n\n6\nthe recommendations of the treatment facility staff; and the fact that she does not attend support\ngroups which could assist her with staying drug free. Once the government establishes a prima facie\ncase to raise a security concern, Applicant has the burden to mitigate the security concern raised.\nApplicant has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns.\nI find against Applicant under Guideline H.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. While it appears\nApplicant made progress while attending in-patient treatment, a security concern remains due to her\nfailure to meet all of her aftercare requirements. She failed to mitigate the security concerns raised\nby the drug involvement concern. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this\ncase, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1\nGuideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. His two annual performance evaluations reflected ratings of 3.05 and 3.20 on a scale of 1 to 5. (AE A; AE B.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.m, of the SOR, and denied the remaining allegations. These three admitted delinquent debts, totaling $6,482, are owed to a jewelry store, a credit union and a university. They became delinquent in 2001, 2004, and 2007, respectively. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. Applicant claimed that the three delinquent debts totaling $2,685, described in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.i, were fraudulently opened in his name by someone else. One was a credit card account and two were for mobile phone services. During an interview with an OPM investigator on March 7, 2007, he claimed a man stole his driver\u2019s license and military ID, and these accounts were opened shortly thereafter. He disputed the debts with the creditors, who insisted that they were legitimately his debts after investigations. During the hearing, he said it was a woman to whom he had given access to everything in his apartment who he suspected of starting these accounts. He confirmed that, after investigation, the companies insisted the debts were his, and acknowledged that they remain unpaid. (Answer at 1, 2, 4; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 31-33, 40, 44-45.)

Although his\nsigned receipt for the hearing notice that was delivered through his company\u2019s facility\nsecurity officer was dated June 24, 2008, he did receive a copy of the notice via\nelectronic mail on June 10, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 25,\n2008. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were admitted without objection. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until July 11, 2008, in order for him to\nsubmit additional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 3,\n2008. On July 11, 2008, Applicant submitted two additional documents to Department\nCounsel. He did not submit any further evidence, and Department Counsel forwarded\nApplicant\u2019s submission without objection to its consideration on July 12, 2008. These\ndocuments were marked AE D, and the record was closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. His two annual\nperformance evaluations reflected ratings of 3.05 and 3.20 on a scale of 1 to 5. (AE A;\nAE B.) In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b,\n1.g, and 1.m, of the SOR, and denied the remaining allegations. These three admitted\ndelinquent debts, totaling $6,482, are owed to a jewelry store, a credit union and a\nuniversity. They became delinquent in 2001, 2004, and 2007, respectively. Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nApplicant claimed that the three delinquent debts totaling $2,685, described in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.i, were fraudulently opened in his name by someone else. One\nwas a credit card account and two were for mobile phone services. During an interview\nwith an OPM investigator on March 7, 2007, he claimed a man stole his driver\u2019s license\nand military ID, and these accounts were opened shortly thereafter. He disputed the\ndebts with the creditors, who insisted that they were legitimately his debts after\ninvestigations. During the hearing, he said it was a woman to whom he had given\naccess to everything in his apartment who he suspected of starting these accounts. He\nconfirmed that, after investigation, the companies insisted the debts were his, and\nacknowledged that they remain unpaid. (Answer at 1, 2, 4; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 31-33, 40,\n44-45.)\nApplicant claimed to have paid the $1,738 judgment debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d.\nActually, he said his mother paid it by credit card and he repaid her with cash and\nmoney orders. Although he testified that he had no evidence that this debt was paid, he\nlater submitted a letter from the judgment creditor showing that an apartment-related\n\n3\ndebt had been paid. (Tr. at 68-69; AE D at 3.) However, the record evidence reflects\nthat this judgment related to a different debt, since the payment of the apartment debt\nwas reflected on two subsequent credit bureau reports (CBR) along with the unpaid\njudgment, which remains reported as unpaid on his most recent CBR as well. During\nhis OPM interview, he explained that a judgment was entered against him during the\nsame month, and in the same court, as the allegation in \u00b6 1.d, for unpaid traffic tickets.\nHe then stated that he had paid that judgment, although no such payment is reflected in\nany record CBR. (Compare GE 2 at 1-2; GE 3 at 3, 10; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 1.) The\nsame collection agency creditor has reported two additional apartment-related debts in\ncollections, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h. Applicant stated that these debts are for\npast-due rent on his wife\u2019s apartment before they were married, and on their shared\napartment where she remained when he moved to another city after they separated in\n2004. He testified that they are still married, though separated, and he will likely be held\nresponsible for both debts, totaling $2,606. (Tr. at 37-40.)\nApplicant denied owing the four remaining debts, listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.j, 1.k,\nand 1.l, because he does not know what each of them is. However, he has neither\ndisputed them with the credit bureaus, nor made any effort to investigate their validity.\nThese debts, of which two became delinquent in 2001 and the other two in 2005, total\n$3,398. (GE 4 at 1-2; Tr. at 35-36, 43-44.) \nIn late April 2008, Applicant retained an attorney to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nrelief. (AE C.) In July, after his hearing, he provided the remaining necessary paperwork\nto the attorney. As of the date the record closed, the petition had not been prepared or\nfiled. (AE D at 4.) Applicant\u2019s income is barely sufficient to meet his monthly expenses,\nand he has no savings. His two cars are paid off. His net pay is about $1,000 each two\nweeks. He pays $750 per month to his wife for child support and $600 per month in\nrent. The remainder of his earnings go toward present living expenses. He attributed his\nfinancial problems to, \u201cunemployment and just being un-responsible altogether,\u201d and\nsaid his wife did not cause any of his delinquent debt. He was unemployed from April\n2001 to May 2002, after his productivity at the car dealership where he worked\ndeclined, and again from September 2003 to January 2004 for unexplained reasons.\nHe was enrolled in a credit counseling program for about six months in the late 1990s in\nan effort to improve his finances and pay his bills. He stopped participating when he\ncould not make the agreed payments. (Tr. at 48-60; GE 1 at 3; GE 5 at 3, 6.)\nApplicant answered \u201cNO\u201d in response to questions 19 and 20 on his SF 85P, that\nasked whether any judgments had been entered against him in the last 7 years or was\nthen over 180 days delinquent on any debt. These answers were false, in that he was\nmore than 180 days delinquent on those debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f,\nand 1.g, as described above. Of these debts, Applicant admitted knowing about and\nowing the \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g debts. He further described actively, but unsuccessfully,\nprotesting the \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f debts with the companies involved, demonstrating that he\nalso knew them to be outstanding and unresolved obligations. He consistently said he\ndid not know anything about the \u00b6 1.c debt, and did not believe he owed the \u00b6 1.e debt\nfor his wife\u2019s pre-marriage rent, so his omission of those two debts was not a deliberate\nfalsification. Applicant\u2019s testimony to the effect that he did not understand what a\n\n4\njudgment was, or that one had been entered against him, was unpersuasive because\nhe described having a judgment entered against him for unpaid traffic tickets during his\nMarch 2007 OPM interview. His explanation for denying the 180-day delinquencies\nwas, \u201cthat probably was just me not actually paying attention to the question closely.\u201d\n(GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 47-48.)\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n5\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this\norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d\nmay raise trustworthiness concerns. Applicant accumulated more than $16,900 in\ndelinquent debt during a period of consistent financial irresponsibility stretching back at\nleast ten years. He claimed some of these debts were not his and did not know about\nothers, but showed nothing to document the validity of such disputes. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination and shifting the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation of the resulting\ntrustworthiness concerns.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of inability to pay his debts spans more than a decade,\nand continues to date. He provided no evidence this would not continue or recur, so this\nmitigating condition is not supported by the record.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were partially caused by two periods of unemployment that resulted from his\nchoices, not due to business failures or unexpected layoffs. His voluntary separation\nfrom his wife did increase family living expenses, but that was also a choice he made.\nHe denied that his wife was responsible for his delinquencies. He has not demonstrated\nthat this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for significant consideration in this\ncase. \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant\u2019s counseling during the late 1990s ended when he\ncould not meet program requirements. He has continued to incur delinquent debt, so\nthe problem is neither resolved nor under control. He offered no proof of resolution or\nrepayment of any SOR-listed debt. He has taken preliminary steps to file a bankruptcy\npetition, but it is premature to consider this potential resolution as substantial mitigation\nbased on evidence presented to date.\nApplicant also failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d While he asserted a potentially valid\nbasis to dispute the validity of several of the debts, he provided no documented proof\ncorroborating those assertions, and testified that his minimal efforts in that regard on\nsome of the debts had been unsuccessful in convincing the creditors that the debts\nwere not his.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may\nbe disqualifying. The disqualifying condition alleged in the SOR and raised by the\nevidence in this case is:\n\n7\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant omitted responsive information about his 2002 judgment debt, and his\nmultiple debts that were more than 180 days delinquent in response to questions 19\nand 20 on his October 2005 Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions. In fact, he\nanswered \u201cNO\u201d in response to each question, denying that those debts existed. He\ncertified the completeness and accuracy of his answers, acknowledging the obligation\nto be truthful. His rationale during his hearing for failing to report the judgment differed\nmarkedly from his comments about it to the OPM investigator which he later ratified as\nbeing true in his interrogatory response. He then explained his false answer to question\n20 happened because he wasn\u2019t paying attention to the question. Neither attempted\njustification for the omissions was persuasive. The weight of evidence in this record\nleads to the conclusion that his false denials and omissions of relevant information\nconcerning his judgment and delinquent debts in response to questions 19 and 20 were\ndeliberate. \nApplicant did not disclose any information about these matters until he was\nasked about it by the OPM investigator during his March 7, 2007 personal subject\ninterview. This does not establish the personal conduct mitigating condition set forth in\nAG \u00b6 17(a): \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d His conflicting\nstatements about why he omitted this information significantly undermine the credibility\nof his assertion that he did not intend to mislead the Government about the existence of\nthese debts and his underlying actions that gave rise to them. He neither asserted nor\nestablished any other personal conduct mitigating condition with respect to these\ndenials and omissions.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to criminal conduct:\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could\nraise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, including: \u201c(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted.\u201d The criminal statute codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 states: \n \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knowingly and willfully\u2013\n\n8\n(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a\nmaterial fact;\n(2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or\n(3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to\ncontain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry;\nshall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 5 years...\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omission and concealment of his 2002 judgment debt and\nsubstantial delinquent indebtedness, as discussed above, constituted a violation of this\nstatute. This, as a felony, is a serious offense within the meaning of AG \u00b6 31(a), and\ndoes call into question Applicant\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations. Applicant neither asserted nor introduced any evidence that would support\napplication of any criminal conduct mitigating condition as set forth in AG \u00b6 32.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s history of financial\nirresponsibility is lengthy and ongoing, resulting in a large number and amount of\ndelinquent debts. His only realistic potential for resolution of these debts is through\nbankruptcy proceedings which he has made only preliminary efforts toward filing. He is\na mature individual who is accountable for the voluntary choices that led to these\ncircumstances. He demonstrated no rehabilitation or other permanent behavioral\nchanges that could support a conclusion that continuation or recurrence is unlikely.\nThese debts continue to create potential for coercion, pressure and duress, as\n\n9\ndemonstrated in his attempts to hide them by falsifying his Trustworthiness\nQuestionnaire. That falsification itself is of serious concern, and constitutes criminal\nbehavior. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising\nfrom his financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\npublic trust position.

O'Brien, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n2\nApplicant has approximately 13 delinquent debts, totaling $16,199. She deliberately failed\nto disclose her delinquent accounts on security clearance applications submitted on September 4,\n2002, and April 20, 2005.  While intending to resolve her delinquent accounts in the future, the\nmajority of her delinquent accounts remain unresolved. She has not mitigated the security concerns\nraised under financial considerations and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence\n1\nthe administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nand Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated December 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on January 24, 2007. The FORM was\nmailed to Applicant on January 25, 2007, and received on January 31, 2007. Applicant was afforded\nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant did not respond. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2007. \nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe case file did not indicate Applicant received a copy of the revised AG. Department\nCounsel's FORM cited the old adjudicative guidelines. On March 23, 2007, an Order was sent to\nDepartment Counsel to amend the FORM citing the revised AGs and send a copy of the amended\nFORM and a copy of the revised AGs to Applicant. Applicant had 30 days to respond after receipt\nof the amended FORM and revised AG.\nApplicant received the revised FORM and a copy of the revised AGs on April 2, 2007.  She\ntimely submitted a nine page response to the amended FORM on May 3, 2007. \nIn her December 18, 2006, Response to the SOR, Item 3, Applicant indicated and provided\nproof that she got married on October 14, 2006.  She took her husband's last name. The SOR is\namended to reflect her married last name.  Her new last name is in parentheses after her maiden\nname in the case caption. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n Items 3 and 4. \n2\n Item 5.\n3\n Item 4.\n4\n Items 6, 7, 8.\n5\n Item 3, Supplemental Response to Revised AG, dated May 1, 2007.\n6\n3\nIn her SOR response, Applicant denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m and admits to all remaining\nallegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful\nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 30-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis applying for a security clearance. She is married and has no children.  \n2\nOn September 4, 2002, Applicant completed a security clearance application, (SF 86).   In\n3\nresponse to question 38.

Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days. \"In the last 7 years, have you\never been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\", she answered, \"No.\" At the time she filled out\nthe SF 86, the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k were over 180 days delinquent. She also\nanswered, \"No\" in response to question 39.

(SOR \u00b6 1.m).5\nApplicant denies the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. She acknowledges that she owes  the debt\nbut disputes the balance. She has not talked with the creditor/collection agency in over a year\nbecause of their aggressive collection tactics.  She denies the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. She\n6\ncontracted with a firm to attend a program that promised to help her obtain a federal job. She claims\n\n Id. \n7\n Response to Revised Form, dated May 1, 2007, at 4-5.\n8\n Id. at 3, 6-9.\n9\n Item 3, Response to Revised Form, dated May 1, 2007, at 3. \n10\n Response to Revised Form, dated May 1, 2007, at 3. \n11\n Item 3.\n12\n Response to Revised Form, dated May 1, 2007, at 2.  \n13\n Department of the Navy v.

She did not save any paperwork. She is disputing the\naccount on her credit report.7\nApplicant paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l which is a cell phone account. She settled the\naccount for $600 on September 23, 2005.  She entered into a payment plan with the creditor for the\n8\ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g.  She agreed to pay $25 per month on the 14th of each month.\nShe provided copies of the checks sent to the creditor in November, February, March and April. She\nclaims she paid the December and January payments online.  No documentation was provided\n9\nverifying these two payments were made.\nApplicant sent letters to the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.i and 1.k.  She has not heard\nback from these creditors.   She has not contacted the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e.\n10\nShe intends to contact them within the next month to establish a payment plan or a settlement that\nshe can afford to pay.11\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant stated \"I first must apologize for making false\nstatements about my debt. It hasn't been until recently that I have started to take my credit more\nseriously by making sure I pay my debts on time.\"   In her response to the revised FORM, Applicant\n12\nclaims that although she admits to providing a false statement on her security clearance application,\nshe was unaware of her credit situation at the time she submitted her 2002 and 2005 security\nclearance applications.   \n13\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n14\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n15\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 15.\n16\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n17\n Id.\n18\n5\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in this case are: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.15\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.16\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n17\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n18\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\n\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n21\n6\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n19\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.20\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n21\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guidelines F and E.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nApplicant's poor financial history raises a security concern. She has encountered financial\nproblems over the past several years, accumulating 13 delinquent accounts, totaling approximately\n$16,199. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\napply to Applicant's case. By her own admission, Applicant was not very responsible when it came\nto handling her financial affairs in the past. Although Applicant settled one account and is making\npayments towards two other debts, her remaining delinquent accounts remain unresolved.  \nThe financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  I find that none apply.  Applicant did\nnot provide information which would indicate that her financial problems were caused by conditions\nthat were beyond her control. There is no indication Appellant received financial counseling. The\nmajority of the debts remain unresolved. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard\nclassified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any\nwritten document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in\nother official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.\n\n7\nApplicant admits to deliberately falsifying her security clearance applications submitted on September\n4, 2002, and April 20, 2005, with regard to her delinquent accounts. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b616(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar fo I give little weight to her recent clarifications that she was unaware of her delinquent\naccounts when filling out the her security clearance applications.  rm used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies.  \nNone of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply.  Applicant deliberately withheld\nthe fact that she had delinquent debts on two separate security clearance applications.  In her  response\nto the SOR,  she apologized for \"making false statements about my debt\" noting that she only recently\nstarted to make sure that her debts were paid on time. In her response to the revised FORM, dated\nMay 1, 2007, she claims she was not aware of her delinquent accounts when she filled out her security\nclearance applications. I do not find this supplemental response credible considering her prior\napology.   \nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the financial considerations and personal conduct\nconcern. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

On\n1\nDecember 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a\nsecurity clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn January 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 22, 2007. A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued on April 8, 2007, scheduling the hearing for May 3, 2007. Due to caseload\nconsiderations, the case was reassigned to me on April 30, 2007. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. At the hearing, the Government submitted three exhibits, Exs. 1-3, and Applicant\nsubmitted five exhibits, Exs. A-E. All of the exhibits were admitted into the record without\nobjection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.b through 1.d. Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the factual allegation under\nsubparagraph 1.a.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 45 years old and has worked as a senior systems engineer for a defense\ncontractor since 1998. He has held a security clearance in the past. He graduated from college in\n1992 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering.

Campus police cited him for having an open\ncontainer of alcohol.  He was convicted of drinking in public and fined $10. \n4\nIn October 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found guilty, and\nfined $350; all but $100 was suspended. He was ordered to attend an alcohol counseling program\nand his 90-day jail sentence was suspended.\nIn October 1993, he was again charged with drinking in public and fined about $10. He\ncomplied with the court order.\nIn October 2005, Applicant was on an out-of-state business trip. The first day of the trip, he\nfell down the brow of a ship and suffered a severe sprain to his knee and a deep bruise.  He was\n5\ngiven medication. He took a prescribed anti-inflammatory drug, Naproxen.  He was not informed\n6\nthat this drug should not be used when consuming alcohol.  He requested that the job send a\n7\nreplacement for him. A couple of days later, he had dinner with his replacement and some other\ncoworkers.  Applicant had two beers and some rum.  He forgot to give the replacement his business\n8\n9\nfile. Rather than wait until the next day, Applicant drove to the replacement\u2019s hotel. He was pulled\nover by the police because the car\u2019s taillights were out. The officer smelled alcohol. Applicant was\ngiven a field sobriety test, which indicated he had consumed alcohol.\nOn October 22, 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He pled guilty and was\nsentenced to 365 days in jail, 364 days suspended, with the option of eight hours of community\nservice in lieu of jail, placed on five years of unsupervised probation, fined $5,000, with $4,000\nsuspended, ordered to attend an alcohol assessment program, and ordered not to possess or consume\nalcohol. According to his facility security officer, Applicant\u2019s jail term was suspended since he opted\nfor eight hours of community service, which he completed.  He completed the court ordered\n10\ncounseling in March 2006, and is currently on supervised probation.11\nApplicant was in an outpatient alcohol treatment program for 12 weeks after his 2005\nconviction. Twice a week he attended specialized intensive outpatient treatment for group therapy,\n\nEx. B (Discharge Summary, dated June 6, 2006).\n12\nId.\n13\nId. at 2.\n14\nTr. 19; Ex.

His diagnosis at discharge was Alcohol Abuse, in remission, made by a licensed\n13\nclinical social worker at a center for alcohol and drug specialized outpatient programs. 14\nSix witnesses testified at the hearing, and they all provided written character reference\nletters.  The first witness is Applicant\u2019s supervisor and he has a top secret clearance.  He first met\n15\n16\nApplicant in 1993 and they continued their friendship through the years. At work, the witness sees\nApplicant every day and they have been deployed together overseas.  They have both a personal and\n17\nprofessional relationship.  Applicant called him within 24 hours of his DUI arrest in 2005.  This\n18\n19\nwitness believes Applicant\u2019s actions that evening were a mistake and a misjudgment.  He continues\n20\nto endorse Applicant for a security clearance because after that 2005 incident, Applicant no longer\ndrinks alcohol.21\nThe second witness has been Applicant\u2019s coworker since 1994.

She was familiar with the SOR and\n26\nstated:  \u201cI think he\u2019s [Applicant] very responsible. I don\u2019t think he is a cause for any national security\nconcern at all.

The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n34\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n35\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n36\n6\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n36\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol consumption is a security concern because \u201cexcessive consumption often leads to\nthe exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21.)\nIn 1983 and 1993, Applicant was charged with drinking in public. In 1990 and 2005,\nApplicant was charged with DUI. All of his alcohol-related offenses show a pattern of misusing\nalcohol. Thus, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) applies.\nVarious factors can mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. His first offense for DUI\noccurred in 1990. He was fined, his jail sentence was suspended, and he was ordered to attend\nalcohol counseling, which he did. About 15 years later, he had another DUI. He pled guilty to that\ncharge. He was ordered to attend alcohol counseling and not to possess or consume alcohol. His\nfacility security office monitored him and made sure he completed his court-ordered sentence. He\nattended an outpatient alcohol treatment for 12 weeks. He also attended 36 AA meetings. His\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse, in remission, was made by a licensed clinical worker, at a center for\nalcohol and drug specialized outpatient programs. Moreover, he has not had an alcoholic drink since\nthe October 2005 DUI. Consequently, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions \u00b6 23(b) (the\nindividual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provided evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol\ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser) and \u00b6 23(d) (the individual has successfully\ncompleted inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare,\nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordant with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics\nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program) apply. Applicant has mitigated the Government\u2019s case. Allegations 1.a\nthrough 1.d of the SOR are found for Applicant. \nI have considered all the evidence in the case. I have also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant\nhas had a drinking history since from 1980 to at least October 2005. He had been drinking\n\n7\nresponsibly, except for his two DUIs. However, the DUIs were 25-years apart. Applicant testified\ncredibly about his remorse for his 2005 drinking infraction. He followed the court-ordered directive\nand has abstained from alcohol since October 2005. Based on the evidence of record, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons stated,\nI conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His mother, father, three sisters, and two\nof his children were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens.  Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family,\nincluding her mother, father, three sisters, and one brother are citizens and residents of Taiwan.\nNone of these family members, belong to, participate in, or are active with any government agency\nof Taiwan.

Applicant\u2019s\nstrong attachment to the United States makes it highly unlikely that he would respond favorably to\nany efforts to act against United States interests.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted\nor denied. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign\nresidency and/or citizenship of close family members.\nApplicant filed a notarized response, dated December 8, 2006, to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 8, 2007, the\ncase was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written\ndecision, but on February 20, 2007, the case was reassigned to this Administrative Judge. Pursuant\nto formal  Notice of Hearing, dated March 21, 2007, a hearing was held on March 29, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered 13 documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits\n1-13) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered nine documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-I) and\noffered his own testimony and that of four other witnesses. The transcript (Tr) was received on April\n13, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive. The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a., through\n1.e., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. The admitted\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the witnesses, and\nupon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \n\n3\nApplicant is 47 years old. He is employed as a Principal Systems Engineer by a United States\ndefense contractor, and he seeks to retain a security clearance that he has held without interruption\nsince 1978. \nApplicant was born in the United States and is a U. S. citizen. He served in the United States\nNavy from 1977 to 1981, and he received an Honorable Discharge. Applicant\u2019s mother, father, three\nsisters, and one brother-in-law are also citizens and residents of the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s wife of 14 years was born in Taiwan and is still a citizen of Taiwan.  She became\na permanent resident in the United States in 1993, but because she moved back to Taiwan with her\nhusband for eight years, and has now been back for less than 3 years, she has not yet qualified to\napply for United States citizenship.  She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she is eligible.\nShe received a Master\u2019s Degree in United States law  from a U. S. university. Applicant and his wife\nhave three children; two were born in the United States and one in Taiwan, but they are all United\nStates citizens.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family, including her mother, father, three sisters, and one brother are\ncitizens and residents of Taiwan. They all work together as owners and operators of two restaurants\nin Taiwan. None of these family members, belong to, participate in, or are active with any national\ngovernment agency of Taiwan. His wife remains very close to her family, and travels to Taiwan\nevery summer with her children to visit them.  She communicates with some members of her family\non a regular basis, averaging three or four times a week. Applicant talks to his wife\u2019s family\napproximately every two months, and he has seen them for a week in 2005 and 2006.\nFrom 1996 to 2004, Applicant and his wife resided in Taiwan. Applicant worked on a\nDepartment of Defense contract; specifically he was an operations and maintenance person for a\ntraining system sold with the approval of  the United States Government  to the Taiwanese Air Force.\nDuring that period he continued to maintain his U. S. security clearance, and he also had a Taiwanese\nsecurity clearance. He traveled back to the United States each year that he lived in Taiwan.\nDuring the period he worked in Taiwan, Applicant made some friendships with three\nTaiwanese Air Force personnel, now retired. He continues contact with them on a casual basis, by\nemail every other month.  \nApplicant does not have any financial interest in Taiwan. All of his significant financial\nholdings are in the United States. His wife, as one of five siblings, has a potential interest in the two\nrestaurants in Taiwan, but the value is unknown. \nMitigation\nFour individuals testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. All of them work for the same company as\nApplicant, and all have known him for many years. They all spoke extremely positively about\nApplicant as an honest, trustworthy, and hardworking individual.\n\n4\nCurrent Status of Taiwan\nSince Applicant's wife\u2019s family members are citizens and residents of Taiwan, and he has had\nother contacts there as well, it is important to consider the status of Taiwan at this time.\nTaiwan has an elected democratic government. It has the 17  largest economy in the world,\nth\nand it is a leading producer of high-technology goods. It engages in industrial and economic\nespionage. Proprietary information technology is high on the Taiwanese list of targeted information\nto be acquired by their agents from foreign governments and businesses. There are 23 million\nTaiwanese citizens. Their per capita income in 2005 was $15,000, cited by their president in a speech\nthat he presented as economic progress under his administration. Although the United States now\nrecognizes Taiwan as part of the PRC as \u201cone-China\u201d it continues to maintain strong unofficial\nrelations with Taiwan.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\n\n5\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has established an initial  reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence). \nApplicant\u2018s wife\u2019s mother, father, three sisters and brother are citizens and residents of\nTaiwan. The Taiwanese citizenship and residency of Applicant's family create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes\nApplicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties\nraises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. This Applicant has done.\n  The evidence of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, comes\nwithin Disqualifying Condition (DC) 7(a) contact with foreign family members, who are citizens and\nresidents in a foreign country, if that contact creates heightened risk of foreign exploitation,  pressure\nor coercion. \nThe primary factors in mitigation that I have considered include: Applicant is a native-born\nUnited States citizen; all his blood relatives, including his mother, father, three sisters, and two\nchildren were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens; his third child was born in Taiwan but\nis also a United States citizen; Applicant served honorably in the United States Navy for four years,\nand he has held a security clearance since 1978; there is no government involvement of Applicant\u2019s\nwife\u2019s family in Taiwan; finally, Applicant expressed strong feelings concerning the United States.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s wife is still a citizen of Taiwan, she plans to apply for United States citizenship\nwhen eligible. After considering all of these factors, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated any\nprevious security concerns, thereby demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security\nto grant him a security clearance.\n\n6\nBased on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence,  I have determined\nthat Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family in Taiwan does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and\nMitigating Condition (MC) 8 (b) applies, there is no conflict of interest because Applicant has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event\npressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it and\nwould  report the incident to the proper authorities. \n \n        \nOn balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's evidence opposing\nhis request for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has three delinquent debts totaling $11,759. In her response to the SOR, she\nindicates that the bills are in the process of being paid off.  At the close of the record, there is\nsufficient proof that one account is paid.  Applicant provided no proof that the other two debts were\nsettled. She has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations.\nApplicant's request to be granted a  position of a public trust position is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Item 5.\n2\n Id.\n3\n Item 6, see also Items 7-10.\n4\n2\nOn December 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a position of public trust.  The SOR, which is in\n1\nessence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated January 2, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on July 11, 2007. The FORM was\nmailed to Applicant on July 12, 2007, and received on July 17, 2007. Applicant was afforded an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant admits all of the allegations. Her admissions are incorporated\nherein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 53-year-old woman employed with a Department of Defense contractor who\nis applying for a position of public trust. She is married and has two children and one stepchild.2\nOn August 16, 2004, Applicant completed a questionnaire for public trust position, Standard\nForm 85P (SF 85P).   In response to question 22(b) Your Financial Record, \"Are you now over 180\n3\ndays delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?\", she listed three debts from 2002.  In an\naffidavit provided to OPM related to her background investigation, Applicant listed the three\naccounts alleged in the SOR.  They include a $3,686 personal loan, placed for collection in July 2002\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $928 department store credit card account that was charged off and placed for\ncollection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and a $7,145 delinquent credit card account, placed for\ncollection in August 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).4\nIn a signed statement provided to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on September\n18, 2003, Applicant indicated that she and her husband got behind on their bills in 2002. In May\n2002, they were both unemployed. Neither of them received unemployment benefits. Applicant\nbegan working full-time for her current employer in September 2002. Her husband was still not\n\n Item 6. \n5\n Item 4. \n6\n Item 10 at 3. \n7\n Item 10 at 2. \n8\n Item 10 at 2. \n9\n Item 6 at 5. \n10\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). \n11\n3\nworking a steady job in September 2003.  She tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with her creditors\nto make smaller monthly payments. She intends to pay these bills off as soon as she can.   \n5\nIn her response to the SOR, dated January 2, 2007, Applicant indicates that the bills are in\nthe process of being paid off and included a copy of a Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Settlement Statement, dated January 2, 2007.  The settlement statement includes a\nsection called \"Disbursement to Others.\" This section lists eight creditors.  Three of the creditors\nlisted were the creditors alleged in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.6\nApplicant did not provide additional information to verify that all three accounts alleged in\nthe SOR were fully satisfied (such as receipts from the creditor indicating the account was paid in\nfull). A July 10, 2007, credit report provided by the Government lists the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a\nas paid in full.   The credit report still lists the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.b as a $928 charged off\n7\naccount. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is listed with a balance of $7,145 but there is a notation that\nApplicant disputes the account.  An additional collection account in the amount of $1,253 is  listed.\n8\nIt is likely that this is the same debt that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b that has been transferred to a new\ncollection agency.9\nOn September 23, 2003, Applicant provided a personal financial statement. Her net monthly\nhousehold income was $1,469.05.  Her total monthly household expenses were $1,325.46. Applicant\nhad approximately $143.59 left over each month after expenses.   She did not provide an updated\n10\npersonal financial statement in response to the SOR.    \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n11\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines,\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense,\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n12\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n13\n Id.\n14\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n17\n4\neffective September 1, 2006, sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in\nthis case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.12\nConditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as\nthose which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth\nand discussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n13\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n14\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n15\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.16\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  The same rules apply towards trustworthiness\n17\ndeterminations for access to sensitive positions.\n\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to\nApplicant's case. In 2002, Applicant and her husband encountered financial problems due to a period\nof unemployment.  They incurred three delinquent accounts totaling $11,759. \nThe financial considerations concern can be mitigated.  Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant did not attempt to\nresolve these delinquent accounts until late December 2006/early January 2007.  Applicant's financial\nproblems were ongoing and recent.  It is unclear whether two of the accounts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c\nhave been completely resolved.   \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) applies,\nin part. Applicant and her husband encountered financial problems when they both were unemployed\nin May 2002. However, Applicant has been employed full-time since September 2002.  She did not\ntake steps to resolved her delinquent debts until January 2007, approximately one month after the\nSOR was issued. FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight due to the length of time it took Appellant to\ntake action to resolve her delinquent accounts.      \nFC MC 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply.  Applicant\nprovided no evidence that she attended financial counseling.  She did not provide information on her\ncurrent financial situation, such as an updated personal financial statement. Two of the three\ndelinquent debts remain listed as delinquent debts on Applicant's credit report.  Applicant has\nprovided insufficient information to form a conclusion that her financial situation is now under\ncontrol.  \n \nFC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts ), applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  However, Applicant\nhas the burden to mitigate the concerns raised due to her financial situation. Part of that burden is to\nprovide sufficient proof that her delinquent debts were paid in full.  She did not meet her burden of\nproof to show that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1(b) and 1(c) were satisfied.  Both accounts are listed\non her most recent credit report. She did not provide enough evidence to support her claims that these\naccounts are resolved.  \nApplicant provided no information as to her current financial status.  There is no evidence that\nshe received financial counseling which would be helpful given her past history of financial\nirresponsibility.  For these reasons, Applicant has not provided sufficient information to mitigate the\nconcerns under Guideline F.    \n\n6\nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under financial considerations. Therefore, I am\npersuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a position of public trust.\n \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the evidence presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to find Applicant suitable for a position of public trust. Applicant's request\nto be granted a position of public trust is denied.\nErin C. Hogan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Glendon Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of illegal drug\nuse and a  March 2005 arrest for possession of marijuana.  He failed to mitigate the security concerns\n\n2\nraised under the drug involvement and personal conduct guidelines. Applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nA Notice of Hearing dated June 4, 2007 was mailed to Applicant. He waived the 15-day period for notice.\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated November 27, 2006.\n3\nGE 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated August 6, 2004) at 1-7.\n4\nId. at 3.\n5\nId.\n6\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 6, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On October 27, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR,\n1\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn November 27, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected\nto have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2007.\nOriginally the case was to be scheduled in March, but Applicant was out of the country and\nunavailable until his return to this country in June 2007.  I scheduled the hearing for June 12, 2007.\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 12, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Three\nGovernment Exhibits (GE 1-3) were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s three exhibits (AE A-\nC) were also admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and\npresented the testimony of his older sister, as reflected in the hearing transcript received on June 21,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted to all allegations in the SOR  under Guideline H and Guideline E.  The\n3\nadmissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record\nand upon due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  After he dropped out of high\n4\nschool, he began working in the field of communications. He received training through a program\nsponsored by the military.  He has worked for his current employer since 2004. Applicant is single\nwith no children.

He also used crystal methamphetamine when he was 15 or 16 years\nold, and admitted that he became addicted to the illegal substance, but kicked the habit.  \n7\nIn April 2003, Applicant used marijuana at a party. He shared a cigarette or two. At that\nsame time, he began work with a company that had a policy of mandatory drug testing.  In May\n8\n2003, after starting the position, he was required to take a drug screening test for his employment.\nHe tested positive for marijuana. Shortly thereafter, he was fired from his position.  He takes full\n9\nresponsibility for failing the drug test at work. \nAfter he was fired from his position in 2003, Applicant vowed he would not smoke marijuana\nagain because it cost him his job. He avoided people who had contact with drugs. He stated he\nlearned from his mistakes and understood the risk was not worth it.10\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in 2004. He held an interim security\nclearance and was aware that smoking marijuana or using any illegal substance could jeopardize his\nclearance. However, he used marijuana a few times after he completed that application.\nOn March 14, 2005, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana.  When he was in\n11\nthe airport ready to leave for Iraq someone at a bar gave him a marijuana cigarette as a going away\npresent. He was trying to take it to Iraq. During the security screening, Applicant was pulled aside\nafter a metal detector alarm. He acknowledges that he was not thinking.  He spent a night in jail. The\ncharges were dismissed. He was ordered to attend drug abuse counseling overseas that was offered\nthrough the military. He successfully completed the sessions.12\nApplicant declares he will never use an illegal drug again in his life. He understands the\nramifications for his future. He knows using drugs is illegal. He stated his experience with marijuana\nwas not good. At the hearing, he acknowledged that using a drug illegally reflects on a person\u2019s\nwillingness to comply with laws. He stated, \u201cit is plain and simple\u2014it is a lack of regard for rules\nand the law\u201d 13\n.\n\nAE A (Letter from Supervisor, dated February 28, 2006.)\n14\nAE C (Letter from Manager, undated.)\n15\nAE B (Performance Appraisal, dated January 2006 through January 2007).\n16\nTr. 53.\n17\nTr. 66-67.\n18\n Department of the Navy v.

He maintains a professional appearance and\n14\nsets a good example to the other staff. He displays a high degree of proficiency and professionalism\nin his work. He has excellent rapport with his customers and his work exceeds expectations.  His\n15\nmost recent Performance Appraisal rates him as an exemplary employee.16\nHis three-year work record in Iraq providing support in telecommunications is rated highly.\nHis immediate supervisor recommends him for any position and has great confidence in his ability\nto complete any task assigned to him.  In 2007, he was selected as the Lead Supervisor for his\ndivision. He was responsible for day to day operations and was responsible for 28 employees at that\nlocation. He is embarrassed by his loss of employment due to failing a drug test. He takes full\nresponsibility for the use of marijuana and understands that it was stupid to jeopardize his job. He\nclaims that his family\u2019s welfare is more important to him now than smoking marijuana. He takes his\nwork responsibilities seriously. While overseas the last two years he has avoided any situations\nwhere drugs may have been used. He states he will make a change in his lifestyle and apologizes for\nthis mistake.17\nApplicant owns a home. He sends money to his mother when he is working abroad to help\nher with her expenses. He has a strong work ethic and has steadily risen in the field of\ntelecommunications without benefit of advanced degrees. He assists his sister financially with her\nadopted child. 18\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n19\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n20\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n21\n Id.\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n23\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n25\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n26\nAG \u00b6 24.\n27\n6\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n20\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n21\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n22\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.23\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n24\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n25\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  \n26\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline H of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.27\n\n7\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant used marijuana\nfor a period of more than eight years on a social basis until 2005. He was fired from employment in\n2003 for failing a drug test. Consequently, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) AG\n\u00b625(a) (any drug use), DI DC AG \u00b625(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use) and DI DC AG \u00b625(c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia) apply.\nApplicant smoked marijuana after completing his 2004 security clearance application. He had\nan interim clearance. Thus DI DC AG \u00b625(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance) applies.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Drug\nInvolvement Consideration Mitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b626 (a) (the behavior happened so long\nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). However, it does\nnot apply because he was smoking marijuana in March 2005 after he completed his security\napplication. Despite his loss of employment in 2003 for smoking marijuana, he continued to take risks\nwith using an illegal drug. In 2005 Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana.\nApplicant provided insufficient evidence or explanation to support the DI MC AG \u00b626 (b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation. Applicant stated that he values his family and making a decent living is\nmore important than smoking marijuana. Given his history of marijuana use for more than eight years,\nand his 2003 firing, and 2005 arrest while holding an interim clearance, I find an insufficient proof of\na demonstrated intent.\nApplicant apologizes for his mistakes, and states he has thought about his life and will not be\ninfluenced by peer pressure. However, Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security\nconcern. Allegations 1.a through 1.e are decided against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process. \nApplicant lost a job because he tested positive for marijuana in 2003. He vowed he would not\nuse marijuana again. After completing a security clearance application and understanding the\nimportance of not using an illegal drug, he was arrested in March 2005 for possession of marijuana.\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (e) (personal conduct, or concealment\nabout one\u2019s conduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1)\n\n8\nengaging in activities which i, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding) is raised due to Applicant\u2019s recent possession of marijuana.\nDespite Applicant\u2019s exemplary work record and evidence of good character, he repeatedly\nengaged in risk taking behavior by using marijuana while holding an interim security clearance. He\ncompleted the required drug counseling sessions after his 2005 arrest and vows that he has learned his\nlesson in this regard. He stated that he has no intent to engage in this behavior again and would never\nbe disloyal to his country. However, it is premature for the application of Person Conduct Mitigating\nCondition (PC MC) AG \u00b617(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or has taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and\nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur).\nApplicant revealed the information about the illegal drug use to the Government and to his\nsister. Thus, PC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) partially applies.\nAllegation 2.a is decided against Applicant. \n \nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nApplicant was candid and straightforward in his demeanor and testimony at the hearing. He\nacknowledges that he was not thinking in 2005 when he accepted the marijuana cigarette at the airport.\nHe stated that it was one of the lowest things he has ever done. He is remorseful. He attended\ncounseling while overseas. He also shouldered great responsibility in his job overseas. He was sincere\nin his testimony that he realizes there is a great inconsistency in his poor judgment as recent as 2005\nand the great responsibility that he shouldered in his position overseas with the defense contractor.\nApplicant has not carried his burden in this case. There is not a sufficient period of abstinence.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant\u2019s recent lapse in judgment with drugs leaves doubt as to his\nreliability. I have considered his desire to put this behind him, but I conclude it is premature to find\nin favor of Applicant. Despite his good characteristics, he has not met the burden to overcome the\nconcern. It is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant a security clearance\nfor Applicant. Clearance is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",
