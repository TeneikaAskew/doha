(Item 3.) On December 27, 2017, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on March 3, 2018, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2.) A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) prepared by Department Counsel, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nconsisting of Items 1 to 7, was provided to Applicant on April 24, 2018. Applicant \nreceived received the file on June 2, 2018.1  \n \n \nItem 7 is a request for administrative notice concerning the Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan (Afghanistan). Department Counsel provided an eight-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by ten Government documents pertaining to Afghanistan. The \ndocuments provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative \nnotice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters \nof general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the \nFindings of Fact.  \n \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted additional \ninformation. Department Counsel had no objection and the information is admitted into \nevidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on July 30, 2018. \nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 63 and married with three daughters. He seeks to obtain national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information in connection with his employment \nas a linguist. (Item 3 at Section 13A.) \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan in 1955. He received a medical degree in \nAfghanistan in 1981. Applicant was employed by the Afghan government as a medical \nofficer assigned to a ministry from 1982 until 2008. He has had no contact with any of \nthe people he worked with at the ministry since approximately 2016. (Item 3 at Section \n12; Item 5 at 2-4.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law sponsored Applicant and his family to immigrate to the \nUnited States. They began the process in 1996. Applicant, his wife, and their three \ndaughters were approved to immigrate to the United States in 2007, and moved to the \n                                            \n1 Department Counsel submitted seven Items in support of the SOR allegations. Items 4 and 6 are \ninadmissible. They are the summaries of unsworn interviews of Applicant conducted by interviewers from \nthe Office of Personnel Management on January 3, 2012; and August 2, 2016. Applicant did not adopt the \nsummaries as his own statements, or otherwise certify them to be accurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, \nthese Report of Investigation (ROI) summaries are inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief in the \nabsence of an authenticating witness. (See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, Items 4 and 6 are also cumulative. Applicant is not legally trained and might not have \nunderstood Department Counsel\u2019s FORM footnote 1, which described the potential admissibility of Items \n4 and 6. I therefor reviewed them for any potentially mitigating information that Applicant might have \nthought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will be discussed later in this decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nUnited States permanently in August 2008. Applicant became a naturalized American \ncitizen in 2014. His wife and daughters are also naturalized American citizens, living in \nthe United States. An investigator reported, \u201cSubject [Applicant] and his family are very \nhappy to be living in the U.S. and are grateful for the opportunities that have been \nprovided to them.\u201d Applicant stated that his financial situation is good. No derogatory \ninformation was found in a review of Applicant\u2019s finances. (Item 3 at Sections 9, 17, and \n18; Item 5 at 9; Item 6 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant began working as a linguist in 2012, before he became an American \ncitizen. He left the job in 2014 to be with his wife, who was diagnosed with breast \ncancer. He once again became employed as a linguist in early 2016, and is currently \ndeployed to Afghanistan. (Item 2; Item 5 at 1; Applicant Exhibit A.) \n \n \n \n \nApplicant obtained an American passport in 2015. During the time he was \nemployed as a linguist as a lawful permanent resident, he used a travel document \nprovided by the United States Government for overseas travel. (Item 1 at Section 8; \nItem 5 at 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His father passed away in 1979, and his \nmother in 2016. He has numerous half-brothers and half-sisters on his father\u2019s side. \nApplicant does not have a close relationship with any of them, and has not had any \ncontact with any of them in years. None of his relatives have knowledge of Applicant\u2019s \njob, or the fact that he is applying for a security clearance. (Item 3 at Section 18; Item 6 \nat 6.) \n \n \nWith regard to two half-brothers specifically mentioned in the SOR, Applicant had \nthe following information: \n \n \n1.b. This relative worked for an Afghan government ministry. Applicant has had \nno contact with him since 2015. (Item 2.) \n \n \n1.c. This relative worked for the Afghan government as a doctor. Applicant has \nhad no contact with this relative since 2008. (Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant \ncompleted \na \ncounterintelligence-focused \nsecurity \nscreening \nquestionnaire in March 2016. (Item 5.) He was also interviewed by investigators from \nthe Office of Personnel Management in 2012 and 2016. (Items 4 and 6.) The \ninformation provided by Applicant during these occasions was consistent, and matches \nhis Answer to the SOR. (Item 2.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant is a highly respected and successful linguist. This is shown by letters of \nappreciation and certificates of achievement presented to him with regard to his work in \nAfghanistan. At one point Applicant supported an American military police battalion that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nwas conducting detention operations. The commanding office of the battalion stated in a \nletter of appreciation, \u201c[Applicant] has played a vital role in the translation and \ninterpretation with our Afghan Army counterparts. . . [Applicant] has always displayed a \nhigh degree of integrity, responsibility and ambition.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 2.) \nApplicant Exhibit A also contains five certificates of appreciation from various military \nunits extolling Applicant\u2019s abilities and conduct providing linguistic support during \ncombat operations.   \n \nAfghanistan \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2001, the United States led a \ncoalition to remove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains an \nimportant partner with the United States in the fight against terrorism, and has been \ndesignated a Major Non-NATO Ally. However, numerous attacks and kidnappings have \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Afghans. \nEven with aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in \nAfghanistan remains high. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively \nas state intelligence services. (Item 7: Attachments.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.@ In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information.  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant has numerous half-sisters and half-brothers who live in Afghanistan. \nTwo of them have worked directly for the Afghan government. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfghanistan has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate \nopenly and contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s substantial and close \nfamily connections in that country have the potential to generate a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a).2 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n                                            \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his family members who live in Afghanistan. \nHe last had contact with any of them in 2015, many of them not since 2008, when he \nmoved to the United States. Applicant, his wife, and three daughters are all American \ncitizens and reside here. Applicant\u2019s connections with his direct family here far outweigh \nhis contacts with his half-siblings in Afghanistan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nApplicant served in Afghanistan without any indication that he had breached \nsecurity policies or procedures while supporting combat and detainee operations. While \nthat fact is not normally a factor in granting national security eligibility and a clearance, \nthe Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) the \nfollowing: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures significant probative value \nfor purposes of refuting, mitigating or extenuating security concerns raised \nby the applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. \nSee e.g. ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR \nCase No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-\n10955 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an \nexception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant \nhas established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance \nwith security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the Applicant had made a \nsignificant impact to the national security. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-\n12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances \ncan give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to \nrecognize, resist and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or \nexploitation. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that two of Applicant\u2019s half-brothers have jobs \nwith various governmental entities in Afghanistan. In this particular case, I find that \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance arising from their presence for the \nfollowing reasons. Applicant has been subject to considerable screening for his job. He \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\nconsistently has identified his half-siblings and their jobs. The mitigating evidence \nmakes clear that Applicant has assisted the coalition forces in Afghanistan in a \nsubstantial way. Applicant has completely mitigated the security significance of the \npresence of his relations in Afghanistan. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility and a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan. From 2012 through 2014, and \nagain since 2016, he worked successfully for coalition forces in Afghanistan during \ncombat operations. Applicant has shown himself to be a talented and patriotic American \ncitizen and member of the defense industry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict \nof interest in favor of the United States due to his sense of loyalty to the United States.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:   \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Applicant answered the SOR on January 11, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on January 30, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on April 9, 2019, setting the hearing for April 30, 2019. At the hearing, the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered three exhibits (GE 1 through 3). Applicant testified and submitted \nthree exhibits (AE 1 through 3).

He has one son, age 24.  \n \nApplicant submitted an SCA in March 2016, requesting eligibility for a clearance, \nrecently required for him to continue his job with the U.S. Merchant Marine (USMM). He \nstarted working for federal contractors with the USMM in 2006. He was employed \nbetween 2006 and 2014; unemployed between April 2014 and September 2015 (due to \nmedical issues); and employed from September 2015 to present with different \ncompanies and federal contractors.  \n \nIn his response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2016 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed that he did not timely file his federal income tax return for tax year 2010. He \nexplained he failed to file his 2010 income tax return because he was deployed, but he \nrequested an extension to file his tax return.  \n \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2010 through 2018. Specifically, he filed his 2010 income tax \nreturn in August 2012; established an installment agreement in September 2012; and \npaid off his 2010 tax debt in May 2019. He filed his 2011 income tax return and \nestablished an installment agreement in May 2012; and paid off his 2011 tax debt in \nSeptember 2015. (AE 1, IRS account transcripts for 2010-2011) Applicant claimed that \nhe did not timely file his 2010 and 2011 income tax returns because his accountant had \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmental health problems and failed to file the taxes. The IRS sent him collection and \nintent to levy notices before Applicant established payment agreements to pay taxes \nowed for 2010 and 2011.  \n \nAs of his hearing, Applicant had not filed his federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2018. The total taxes he owes for those years is unknown. \nApplicant testified that he retained the services of another accountant to help him file his \nlate tax returns after he received the SOR. He claimed he was in the process of \nproviding the accountant with information so that he can complete and file his \ndelinquent tax returns.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for not filing his income tax returns on time. He \nclaimed that he has learned a hard lesson and promised to timely file his income tax \nreturns and to pay his taxes in the future. He averred that he failed to file his 2012 \u2013 \n2018 tax returns because of his multiple deployments and his prior accountant\u2019s mental \nhealth problems. \n \nApplicant highlighted his over 35 years of combined service in the Navy and \nworking for the USMM. He is concerned about not getting his clearance and losing his \njob. In the past, his job did not require him to have a clearance, but recently they \nchanged the rules. Applicant\u2019s boat captain (master) submitted a highly favorable \nendorsement. In his opinion, Applicant has served with distinction as the ship\u2019s \nstorekeeper during the last three years. He considers Applicant to be honest and \ntrustworthy; the single best storekeeper in the fleet; highly respected by his peers; a true \nseaman; a model citizen; and a patriot in the truest sense of the word. (AE 2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s crewmember evaluation reports for years 2018 and 2019 show that \nhe has been rated excellent (the highest rating) in most categories, or above average \n(the second highest rating) in the remaining categories. (AE 3) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. He failed to \ntimely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 and 2011, and he has not \nfiled income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying \nconditions that raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) \ninability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) \nfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record \nestablished the disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nSix mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently raised by the evidence and are not applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply because Applicant failed to timely file his 2010 and 2011 income tax returns and \nhas not filed income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. I find his behavior \nongoing, frequent, and recent.  \n \n \nApplicant claimed he failed to timely file his income tax returns because of his \ndeployments and his first tax preparer\u2019s mental health problems. Giving due \nconsideration to Applicant\u2019s frequent deployments on behalf of the United States, and \neven taking his claims at face value, he failed to establish that he was financially \nresponsible under the circumstances. He presented no evidence of reasonable efforts \nto resolve his delinquent tax filings for tax years 2012-2018 even after the IRS sent him \ncollection and levy notices concerning tax years 2010 and 2011, and he established \npayment agreements with the IRS. I note that it was not until after Applicant received \nthe November 2017 SOR that he started his efforts to retain a new accountant to file his \nyet-to-be-filed delinquent tax returns. \n \n \nI give Applicant credit for his payment arrangements with the IRS concerning tax \nyears 2010 and 2011, and for his recent efforts to retain an accountant to file his late \nincome tax returns.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns resulted primarily \nfrom his lack of diligence. He neglected his legal obligation to timely file his income tax \nreturns over an extended period. \u201cFailure to comply with federal and state tax laws \nsuggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding to well-established Government \nrules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for \nprotecting classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, \n2016). This is true even if the returns have been filed. See, ISCR Case No. 15-03481 at \n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 27, 2016).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated failure to file his federal income tax returns in a timely \nmanner does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required \nof persons granted access to classified information. See, ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). In sum, Applicant failed to demonstrate financial \nresponsibility. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant, 59, has over 35 years of active service in the Navy and working for \nfederal contractors in the USMM. He held a clearance while in the service. Because of \nhis many years holding a clearance and working for federal contractors, Applicant was \naware he was required to maintain his financial responsibility to be eligible for a \nclearance. He failed to demonstrate good judgment and reliability. His failure to timely \nfile his tax returns for eight consecutive years shows that he has a problem complying \nwith well-established government rules. At this time, his evidence is insufficient to \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision on Remand \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for a public trust position is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an application for a public trust position on June 10, 2016. \nOn November 20, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), citing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F. DOD acted under \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 16, 2018, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on March 30, 2018. On May 15, 2018, a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \n01/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. She received the FORM on May 31, 2018, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AX) A. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2018. On September 20, 2018, I \nissued a decision denying eligibility for a public trust position.  \n \n \nApplicant appealed my adverse decision, and the Appeal Board remanded my \ndecision on December 14, 2018. The Board determined that my statement that \nApplicant \u201csubmitted no documentary evidence of payments, payment plans, disputes, \nor other resolution of any of the debts alleged in the SOR\u201d was erroneous. The Board \nnoted that Applicant\u2019s response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM) included a \ncredit report reflecting a number of debts that were currently under dispute. It also noted \nthat Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR included a document (Attachment to Answer) \nreflecting that the two student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i were not delinquent. \nThe Board concluded that my findings regarding the absence of documentation were \nerroneous, and it remanded the case \u201cfor correction of the errors and issuance of a new \ndecision in accordance with the Directive.\u201d \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old licensed practical nurse (LPN) employed by a federal \ncontractor since July 2016. She was licensed after completing school in June 2009. She \nwas employed in the private sector from December 2009 to October 2014. She worked \npart time from December 2009 to March 2010, was unemployed from March to June \n2010, worked full time from June 2010 to February 2013, left by mutual agreement, and \nwas unemployed from to February 2013 to August 2013. She was employed by a \nmedical doctor from August 2013 to October 2014 and left by mutual agreement. She \nwas unemployed for two months and then worked for a federal contractor from \nNovember 2014 to March 2016, when she was fired for tardiness and absenteeism. She \nwas unemployed until she was hired for her current position. (FORM Item 2 at 11-17; \nFORM Item 3 at 2, 12.) She has never married and has no children. She has never held \na security clearance or eligibility for a public trust position.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts, totaling about $37,366. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from June 2016 and September 2017 and the summary of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) conducted in March 2017. (FORM Items 3, 4 and 5.) \nThe debts are a $10,209 indebtedness to the U.S. government related to disability \npayments, a delinquent car loan, three delinquent student loans, three delinquent \nmedical bills, and ten miscellaneous consumer debts. In the March 2017 PSI, Applicant \nadmitted the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i and promised to \nbring them up to date by January 2018. (FORM Item 5 at 9-10.) \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her application for a public trust position (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the debts and stated that \npayment plans were in place for two student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i). She also \nstated that a telecommunications bill had been paid (SOR \u00b6 1.p), and that she had \npayment plans in place or was trying to negotiate settlements for the rest of the debts \nalleged in the SOR. She attached a document to her answer, reflecting that the student \nloans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i are \u201cin repayment,\u201d and that the accounts were not \ndelinquent as of January 25, 2018. (Attachment to Answer.) \n \n \nBoth student loans were delinquent when Applicant was interviewed by a security \ninvestigator in March 2017. (FORM Item 3 at 10-11.) The credit report from September \n2017 reflected that both loans were still delinquent and that the date of last activity on \nboth loans was in November 2013, when they were assigned to the government. \n(FORM Item 5 at 2.) The Attachment to Answer reflects a disbursement date of \nSeptember 19, 2017 for both loans. It does not reflect when the loans became current, \nnor does it indicate whether they became current through voluntary payments or \ninvoluntary action such as garnishment or diversion of tax refunds. Although the loan \nservicer reflected in the Attachment to Answer was different from the loan servicer \nalleged in the SOR, the amounts were almost identical. Accordingly, I find that the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i were not delinquent as of January 25, 2018.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR did dispute any of the debts. The credit report \nfrom September 2017 (FORM Item 5) did not reflect any disputed accounts. In her \nresponse to the FORM, she submitted documentary evidence that two student loans not \nalleged in the SOR were current. She also submitted a credit report from June 2018, \nreflecting that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.h, and 1.j-1.n were currently \nunder dispute, but the credit report does not reflect the basis for the disputes or the \ndates when they were disputed. (AX A.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nI adhere to and incorporate by reference the statement of policies in my original \ndecision.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive or classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting sensitive or classified information. A person who is financially irresponsible \nmay also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding \nsensitive or classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing potentially disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare numerous and recent. She presented no evidence of circumstances making \n\n \n5 \n \nrecurrence of her financial problems unlikely. Her underemployment from December \n2009 to March 2010 and unemployment from March to June 2010 were conditions \nbeyond her control. She submitted no evidence of the circumstances under which she \nleft jobs by mutual agreement in February 2013 and October 2014. Her unemployment \nfrom March to July 2016 was due to her tardiness and absenteeism. Except for the \nevidence pertaining to the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i, she presented \nno documentary evidence of payments, contacts with creditors, or attempts to resolve \nher delinquent debts. She submitted no evidence showing when or by what means the \nstudent loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i became current. She submitted no \nevidence of financial counseling.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payment \nagreements, payments, or disputes regarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-\n1.h, and 1.j-1.r. The Attachment to Answer reflects that the two student loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i were current as of January 25, 2018, but she submitted no evidence \nshowing how or when the loans became current. Whatever voluntary action she may \nhave taken to resolve them occurred after she was confronted with them by a security \ninvestigator in March 2017 and realized that they were an impediment to obtaining a \npublic trust position. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of \ndebts only under pressure of qualifying for a public trust position. See ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. \n7, 2017). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant did not deny any of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR when she responded to it. To the contrary, she admitted every debt alleged. \nAX A reflects that Applicant recently disputed every debt alleged in the SOR, except the \ndelinquent car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and the two student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.i, but she provided no documentary evidence establishing the basis for her \ndisputes. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nI adhere to and incorporate by reference the whole-person analysis set out in my \noriginal decision. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns raised by her \ndelinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI have reconsidered my formal findings in accordance with the Appeal Board \nremand. My findings on the allegations in the SOR are as follows: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 29, 2018, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on March 21, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in the \nFORM. He supplemented the FORM with an explanatory letter, which was admitted \nwithout objection as Item 12. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly was (a) issued a written notice from his \nemployer (Company A) in December 2012 for dishonesty and unsatisfactory work \nperformance; (b) terminated by Company A in February 2013 for cited violations of \nconduct and performance expectations (including his use of a business account to \npurchase personal items); (c) terminated by Company B in January 2014 following \nunsatisfactory behavior, including a security breach, lengthy breaks, failure to meet \ndeadlines, and habitual tardiness; and (d) reprimanded by Company C in January 2015 \nfor unsatisfactory performance. \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) used a business account to purchase \npersonal items while employed by Company A; (b) accumulated 13 delinquent debts \nexceeding $8,200; (c) accrued two judgments: one in August 2012 for $13,191 and \nanother in June 2014 for $537; and (d) incurred a federal tax lien in September 2008 in \nthe amount of $6,006. Allegedly, these debts, entered judgments, and incurred federal tax \nlien remain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations with \nexplanations. He denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 1.c (pertaining to security \nbreaches) He also denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 2.q, claiming he is making \npayments to resolve his tax lien. He denied without explanation the allegations covered \nby SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d-2.e, 2.j, 2.m, and 2.p. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old office administrator for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant never married and has no children. (Items 4-5) He earned a high school \ndiploma, but did not report any post-high school education credits. He reported no military \nservice. \nSince April 2015, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (Items 4-5) \nPreviously, he worked for other employers in various jobs. He reported unemployment \nbetween January 2014 and July 2014, and between March 2013 and September 2013. \n(Items 3 and 6) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment separations \nIn December 2012, Applicant received written notice from his employer (Company \nA) that he had demonstrated dishonesty and unsatisfactory work performance. (Items 5\u00ad\n6) The notice cited Applicant for (a) disappearance from the department for long periods \nwith no valid reason, (b) falsely claiming he had witnessed a code blue that accounted for \ntardiness, and (c) asking for a patient affairs specialist to lie for him about his new \npatient\u2019s appointment. (Item 6) As the result of his recurrent late reporting to work, he was \nterminated by Company A in February 2013 for cited violations of conduct and failures to \nmeet performance expectations. (Item 7) \nIn January 2014, Applicant was terminated by another employer (Company B) \nfollowing his receipt of notices of unsatisfactory behavior and performance that included a \nsecurity breach, lengthy breaks, failure to meet deadlines, and habitual tardiness. (Items \n6 and 8) The cited security breach consisted of Applicant\u2019s leaving his computer unlocked \nfrom the day before, which exposed it as an open site, containing all physician salary \ninformation and other sensitive data. (Item 8) Before his termination, he was written up on \na disciplinary action form and afforded two weeks to improve his performance and \ndemonstrate timely completion of assigned projects. (Item 5) When Applicant did not \nshow improvement in meeting assigned performance expectations, he was terminated by \nCompany B. \nRecords document that Applicant was reprimanded by Company C in March 2015 \n(following nine months of employment beginning in July 2014) for unsatisfactory \nattendance. Embarrassed by the reprimand, Applicant elected to resign his position in \nApril 2015. (Items 4-5) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2014 and 2016, Applicant accumulated 13 delinquent debts, in addition to \naccruing two judgments (one in August 2012 for $13,191 and another in June 2014 for \n$537), and incurring a federal tax lien in September 2008 for $6,006. (Items 9-12) \nTo date, Applicant has made no documented progress in addressing his listed \ndelinquent debts, judgments, or federal tax lien. His post-FORM claim that he has fulfilled \nhis federal tax liability with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is neither documented nor \ncorroborated in any way and cannot be accorded much weight. Addressing the six debts \nhe denies (SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d-2.e, 2.j, 2.m, and 2.p), Applicant failed to \nprovide any proof that he favorably resolved any of these denied debts by payment, by \nsuccessful dispute, or by other acceptable means. Without evidence to document and \ncorroborate his claims, the information taken from his credit reports must be accorded \npresumptive accuracy and reliability. (Items 9-11) \nApplicant did not provide any character references, performance evaluations, or \npersonal financial information to assess her available income sources and any \nextenuating circumstances to consider in evaluate her overall financial situation. \n3 \n\n                \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists adjudicative guidelines (AGs) to be used by administrative \njudges in the decision-making process covering security clearance cases. These \nguidelines take into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the \nindividual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These guidelines include \nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying \nconditions), if any, and many of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require \nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to \nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .

Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances \nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n5 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised with respect to Applicant\u2019s history of reprimands \nand terminations for cause from three relatively recent employers: Companies A-C. \nAdditional concerns relate to Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts, judgments, \nand a federal tax lien that to date have not been resolved by Applicant. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nRecords substantiate that Applicant encountered a series of adverse personnel \nactions between 2012 and 2015, based on cited lateness and other violations of \ncompany policy and displayed dishonesty, unsatisfactory behavior, and failure to meet \nemployment expectations. Applicant\u2019s collective actions were not probatively refuted \nand fall within the coverage of DC \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several \nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any \nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulation, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nDespite repeated attempts by his managers to upgrade his behavior to company \nstandards, Applicant recurrently displayed behavior incompatible with the performance \nexpectations of his employers (Companies A-C) over an extended period of years \n(2012-2015). Applicant\u2019s furnished explanations for his actions are insufficient to \nsurmount the probative findings supplied by his previous employers responsible for \nApplicant\u2019s reprimands and terminations. Based on the information compiled in the \nrecord, none of the potentially available mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts, judgments, and a federal tax lien \ncovering taxes owed for tax year 2008 that have not been addressed to date invite the \napplication of four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability \nto do so,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts negate the need for any independent \nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). \nEach of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are fully documented and create some judgment \nissues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses \nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving federal and state tax \ndelinquencies and other debt delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and \nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a \nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited circumstances (i.e., \nrecurrent periods of unemployment) entitle Applicant to some mitigation credit for his \nfailure to address his debt delinquencies. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d His failure to address his \ndebt delinquencies after he returned to full-time employment status precludes him, \nhowever, from taking advantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 20(b). \nSimilarly, satisfaction of Applicant\u2019s evidentiary burden of providing probative \nevidence of his addressing his judgments, tax lien, and other debt delinquencies \nrequires more documentation of his addressing his debts than he has provided in his \nsubmissions. While his recurrent periods of unemployment offer some extenuating \ncredit, they are not enough to mitigate his major financial delinquencies without more \nevidence of past and recent efforts to address his delinquent debts. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, his failures or inability to establish documented payment initiatives \nwith his listed SOR creditors, both before and after the initiation of the security \nclearance process, prelude favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised \nsecurity concerns over the state of his finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his delinquent debts to merit more than minimal credit  to \nmitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his \nfinances reflect too little evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to \novercome reasonable doubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that his finances are not \nsufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and \ncircumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n     \n          \n                         \n   \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n                                        \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1d:\n Against Applicant \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q:\n  Against Applicant \nConclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \nhold a security clearance.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On November 16, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudication Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n  \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on December 14, 2017, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on January 30, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March 8, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 30, 2018. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \noffered Applicant Exhibits A through I, which were admitted without objection, and testified \non her own behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open to permit her to \nsubmit additional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 8, 2018. \nApplicant submitted Applicant Exhibit J in a timely manner. Department Counsel had no \nobjection and the exhibit was admitted into evidence. The record then closed.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and employed by a defense contractor as a clinical \nanalyst. She is separated from her husband, and has two children. Applicant is seeking \nto obtain national security eligibility for access to sensitive information in connection with \nher employment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in about 2010, when she separated from her \nabusive husband and gained custody of her youngest child. She initially struggled \nfinancially while working in the nursing field in her home state, since she only had an \nassociate\u2019s degree. Determined to better herself professionally, and monetarily, Applicant \nboth worked and attended school online over several years. By 2016 she had obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. At this point in time she accepted a new job in \na new state, and moved across the country. Applicant is now working to obtain a doctorate \ndegree, which will again make her more marketable and increase her income. Starting in \n2016 Applicant began working on a five-year plan to resolve her debts, with results as \nshown below. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 12; Applicant Exhibits A, G, H, I, and J at \n8; Tr. 25, 31-41, 66-70.) \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.j. She denied allegations 1.a, \n1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i.   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed approximately $38,350 in past-due \nindebtedness to various creditors. The existence and amount of the debts is supported \nby admissions of the Applicant, and credit reports submitted by the Government dated \nJanuary 27, 2017; and January 30, 2018. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4.) Applicant \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nsubmitted a credit report dated December 14, 2017, with her Answer. (Attachment One.) \nShe submitted an additional credit report dated March 30, 2018. (Applicant Exhibit E.) \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows:  \n \n \n1.a. Applicant denied that she owed a judgment in the amount of $4,397. Applicant \ntestified that she had no knowledge of this debt. When Applicant got her job in 2016 she \nbegan educating herself on how to resolve her debts. One of the things she learned was \nto dispute debts she did not recognize. Accordingly, Applicant disputed this debt with the \ncredit reporting agencies. (Applicant Exhibit I; Tr. 41-47.) This debt appeared on the \ngovernment\u2019s 2017 credit report (Government Exhibit 4), but does not appear on the latest \ncredit reports in the record. (Government Exhibit 3; Attachment One; Applicant Exhibit G.) \nApplicant has successfully disputed this debt.      \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted owing $375 for a mobile telephone bill. Applicant had \nacquired the cell phone for her then-boyfriend in about 2012. He was an abusive person \nwho also stole from Applicant during their relationship. She intends to pay this debt as \nothers are paid off. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 47-48.) \n \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted that she owed $876 for a past-due credit card debt. \nApplicant was unable to pay anything on this debt for several years, until she obtained \nher current employment. Starting in 2016 she has been making consistent payments on \nthis account and has paid it down considerably. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant \nExhibit J at 6; Tr. 48-56.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted that she owed $1,095 for a past-due credit card debt. \nApplicant was unable to pay anything on this debt for several years, until she obtained \nher current employment. Starting in 2016 she has been making consistent payments on \nthis account and has paid it down considerably. This debt is being resolved. (Applicant \nExhibit J at 5; Tr. 48-56.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant denied that she owed $14,605 for a repossessed automobile that \nbelonged to Applicant\u2019s daughter. Applicant filed a dispute concerning this debt. \n(Applicant Exhibit J at 8; Tr. 56-57.) This debt appeared on the government\u2019s 2017 credit \nreport (Government Exhibit 4), but does not appear on the latest credit reports in the \nrecord. (Government Exhibit 3; Attachment One; Applicant Exhibit G.) Applicant \nsuccessfully disputed this debt. \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted that she owed $282 to a creditor for a past-due cable debt. \nApplicant supplied documentation showing that she began paying this debt off after being \nemployed in her current job. This debt has now been paid in full and is resolved. (Applicant \nExhibit J at 6-7; Tr. 57-59.) \n \n \n1.g, Applicant denied owing a creditor $246 for a past-due debt. Applicant stated \nthat she had no knowledge of the account and had never purchased anything from the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ncreditor. Applicant filed an unsuccessful dispute concerning this debt. Applicant stated \nthat she will pay this debt, even though she adamantly denied owing it. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. 59.) \n  \n \n1.h. Applicant denied owing a past-due debt in the amount of $5,790 for a bank \ncard. Applicant stated that she had only one credit card with this bank, yet the debt is \nbeing collected by two different collection agencies. This one and one stated in allegation \n1.i, below. When contacted, the bank could not find a record of Applicant\u2019s account. \nApplicant filed a dispute concerning this debt. (Applicant Exhibit J at 7-8; Tr. 60-63.) This \ndebt appeared on the government\u2019s 2017 credit report (Government Exhibit 4), but does \nnot appear on the latest credit reports in the record. (Government Exhibit 3; Attachment \nOne; Applicant Exhibit G.) Applicant successfully disputed this debt. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant denied owing a past-due debt in the amount of $7,534 for a bank \ncard. Applicant stated that she had only one credit card with this bank, yet the debt is \nbeing collected by two different collection agencies. This one and one stated in allegation \n1.h, above. When contacted, the bank could not find a record of Applicant\u2019s account. \nApplicant filed a dispute concerning this debt. (Applicant Exhibit J at 7-8; Tr. 60-63.) This \ndebt appeared on the government\u2019s 2017 credit report (Government Exhibit 4), but does \nnot appear on the latest credit reports in the record. (Government Exhibit 3; Attachment \nOne; Applicant Exhibit G.) Applicant successfully disputed this debt. \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $3,150. Applicant intends to begin paying \nthis debt after paying off the debts in allegations 1.c and 1.d. She has reached out to the \ncreditor and they may be willing to accept a one-time payment. (Applicant Exhibit J at 7; \nTr. 63.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. She has a budget and sticks to it. \nShe lives very frugally, while supporting her mother and her daughter. She has worked \nhard over the last several years to get her financial house in order, and has a plan to pay \nthe rest of her debts in the future. Applicant understands the importance of resolving her \npast-due debts and remaining fiscally secure into the future. (Applicant Exhibits A, B, F, \nand J at 8; Tr. 28-31, 65-66, 70-83.)  \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor submitted a letter on her behalf. The writer hired \nApplicant for her current position in 2016. Applicant had been open and honest about her \nfinancial situation and how she planned to resolve it. The supervisor stated, \u201cI find her \n[Applicant] to be an honorable person who exercises sound judgment on a daily basis.\u201d \nThe writer recommends Applicant for a position of trust. (Applicant Exhibit J at 9.) \n \n \nApplicant provided two letters of recommendation from people who know her at \nwork. One coworker stated, \u201cShe [Applicant] has a great deal of integrity.\u201d A senior training \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nand development specialist stated, \u201c[Applicant] is a responsible, honest and hardworking \nindividual.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits C and D.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I, ADP II, and ADP III are classified as \u201cnoncritical-\nsensitive.\u201d (See DoD Manual 5200.02, April 3, 2017 (Manual) \u00b6\u00b6 4.1.a.(3)(c) and 7.a.) \nThe Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 20014, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will \napply to cases forwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and \nOffice of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \nnational security eligibility decision may be made. (See Manual \u00b6 10.3.) \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. Finally, as \nemphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExecutive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had approximately $38,000 in past-due debts that she had not paid or \nresolved as of the time the SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support \nfor the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate \nthose concerns. \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant had a difficult time financially starting around 2010 to 2016. She left her \nabusive husband, was involved in a second abusive relationship, and had insufficient \neducation to make financial ends meet with the jobs she could get. She went back to \nschool and eventually received her master\u2019s degree. In 2016 she found a new job in a \nnew state, moved, and began preparing and fulfilling a five-year plan to resolve her debts. \nAs shown above, Applicant has paid one debt in full, and is paying two other old credit \ncard debts, while maintaining payments on her current indebtedness. It is not easy, and \nApplicant has had to make some difficult choices, but she is succeeding in paying down \nher debt and there is light at the end of the tunnel. She has shown herself to be \nresponsible in resolving her indebtedness, beginning payments before the SOR was \nissued. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies because much of the debt, and Applicant\u2019s inability to pay it, \nwas related to her separation from her husband. \n \nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve her financial situation, as shown \nby the voluntary payments to several creditors. As the DOHA Appeal Board has said, \u201cAn \napplicant is not required to show that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only \nthat she has established a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken significant \nactions to implement that plan.\u201d1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) apply. \n   \n                                                 \n1ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jul. 6, 2006)). \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nAs part of her five-year plan, Applicant pro-actively disputed questionable debts \nthat she found on her credit report. Those debts have been removed. I find that AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies. \n \nThe Appeal Board has stated: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrates that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable, and she evinces a credible intent and \nability to maintain that stability into the future. Applicant has made substantial lifestyle \nchanges that will assist her in staying on a proper financial footing. She has fully mitigated \nall the allegations in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                 \n2 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding her financial situation. Her actions have minimized the potential for \ncoercion or duress, and make recurrence of financial issues unlikely. Overall, the record \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant=s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility, and access to sensitive information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility to occupy a designated ADP I/II/III sensitive position. Eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is granted. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Schachter, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant submitted an application for a security clearance (e-QIP) on June 3, \n2015. On March 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Guideline E, Personal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \nOn May 19, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 12, 2018. \nAnother administrative judge was assigned the case on September 12, 2018.  On \nDecember 19, 2018, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing on January \n29, 2018. The case was transferred to me on January 29, 2018, because of the \nunavailability of the assigned administrative judge. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, the Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment (Gov) Exhibits 1 - 5. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and offered \none exhibit which is admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, which consisted of 15 \nsubparts without objection. The transcript was received on February 7, 2018. Based \n03/29/2019\n\n2 \n \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations, some with \nexplanations.    \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior systems analyst for a DOD contractor \n(Contractor 1) who seeks a security clearance. She has been employed with Contractor \n1 since February 2018.  She previously worked for Contractor 1 from May 2015 to \nMarch 2017. Between March 2017 and February 2018, she worked for another DOD \ncontractor (Contractor 2). She was granted an interim security clearance in September \n2015. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree. She is married, has a four-year-old daughter, and is \nexpecting another child. She is the primary breadwinner. Her husband stays at home to \ncare for the children.  (Tr. 22, 43-44, 53; Gov 1) (Note: The facts in this decision do not \nspecifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and her family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.)  \n \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nfrom 2015 to November 2017, after she was granted access to classified information \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 3, 8); received treatment from Dr. R. from May 2012 to November \n2013 for Drug Dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.b Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2); received treatment at a \nsubstance abuse institute from April 2007 to May 2011 for Drug Dependence (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c: Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2,4); and received treatment at a county health substance \nabuse center from August 2000 to April 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 11). \n \nAdditional allegations include:  use of cocaine with varying frequency from \nJanuary 2007 to April 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 9); use of the following prescription \nmedications without a prescription: OxyContin, Oxycodone, Heroin, and Methadone \nbetween December 2003 and October 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 8-9); used marijuana \nwith varying frequency between 1996 and November 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 11; \nGov 3 at 3); misuse of prescription opiates from December 2003 to December 2008 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 3 at 3); purchase of crack cocaine for personal use from January 2005 \nto January 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 3 at 3); illegally purchased opiates for personal use \nbetween May 2003 and December 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 3 at 3); and a July 2001 arrest \nfor Possession of Marijuana and Drug Paraphernalia (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 11; Gov 4; \nGov 5). \n \n  The same conduct is cross-alleged under the personal conduct concern. (SOR \n\u00b6 2.a) In her response to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations, but explains some \nof her illegal drug use was more intermittent and sporadic than the language of the SOR \nimplies. (Response to SOR, dated May 19, 2018)  \n  \n Applicant began drinking alcohol and using marijuana at age 12. Her alcohol use \nvaried from daily, when she was younger, to once every few months, to once a week \nduring the past few years before she quit drinking in November 2017. Her marijuana \nuse was daily when she was younger. She stopped using for several years and her \n\n3 \n \nmost recent use occurred once or twice a year. She stopped using marijuana after her \nNovember 2017 use. Applicant first used cocaine when she was 16. Her cocaine use \nwas sporadic from age 16 to 22.  From age 22 to 27, she used cocaine on varying \noccasions from several times a week to once a month. (Gov 3 at 3)  \n \nApplicant first used opiates around 2001, when she was 19. She became \naddicted to opiates when she was 22. She would use any form of opiate she could find \nin order to keep from going into withdrawal. She eventually used heroin because it was \ncheaper. From 2007 to 2011, Applicant was prescribed and administered Methadone to \ncombat her opioid addiction. In 2012, she began seeing a psychiatrist, Dr. R., who \nprescribed her the drug suboxone to help her become free of opiates and to help treat \nher underlying psychological issues. She was able to ween herself off the suboxone by \nNovember 2013 (age 32). She has not abused opiates since that time. In November \n2015, she was prescribed Percocet after she gave birth to her daughter. She has not \nused opiates of any sort since her daughter\u2019s birth. (Gov 3 at 3)  \n \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant sporadically used LSD (twice a year \nto every other year) from 1998 to 2004 (age 14 \u2013 21); psilocybin (mushrooms) on three \noccasions between 1999 to 2004 (age 17 \u2013 21); and crystal methamphetamine a few \ntimes in 2006 (age 23). (Gov 3 at 3) Because the use of these drugs was not alleged in \nthe SOR, I will not consider the use under the disqualifying conditions. However, I will \nconsider them under the extenuation and mitigating circumstances. In ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).  \n  \nIn July 2001, Applicant had one drug-related arrest for Possession of Marijuana \nand Drug Paraphernalia.  After her arrest, she was ordered to attend treatment at the \ncounty substance abuse center. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant received a diagnosis \nof drug dependence during this treatment.  The records from this treatment program are \nnot in the record, so the diagnosis of drug dependence during this treatment is not \nconfirmed. (Gov 4; Gov 5)   \n \nApplicant voluntarily attended drug treatment at an institute that prescribed her \nmethadone from April 2007 to May 2011. Applicant realized that if she continued using \nheroin it would be a death sentence. The methadone replaced her heroin cravings.  \nHowever, during this time frame, Applicant was offered and used crack cocaine on \nvarious occasions. Her explanation at hearing was that the methadone clinic was in a \n\n4 \n \nbad area and it was common for other drugs to be available. (Tr. 57-58; Gov 1 at 41-\n153; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2,4)   \n \nAfter several years of using methadone, Applicant felt that she was replacing one \naddictive substance for another. In 2012, she sought the assistance of Dr. R., a \npsychiatrist, who treated her for drug dependence as well as her issues with depression \nand anxiety. Dr. R. prescribed Applicant suboxone. If applied properly, suboxone is \nhelpful for heroin users to ween off heroin and methadone. Applicant wanted to be \ncompletely clean from both narcotics. She was able to be completely free of opiates by \nNovember 2013. (Tr. 25-27, 51-53; Gov 1 at 46; Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 2-4) Applicant \ncontinues to take medication to deal with her depression and anxiety. (Gov 3 at 4-7)  \n \nWhen Applicant completed her security clearance application on June 13, 2015, \nshe fully disclosed her history of illegal drug use. When commenting on the extent of her \ndrug use in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Controlled Substances, Applicant stated several \ntimes: \n \nI last smoked marijuana about 2 \u00bd years ago. I have been clean from all \nillegal substances for about 4 years. I was once addicted to opiates, but I \nhave undergone extensive treatment for the disease of addiction and for \nthe underlying medical conditions for which I was self medicating. I am a \ndifferent person now than I was back then. I have married, started a family \nand earned my bachelor\u2019s degree (graduating with honors). I do not \nassociate with those who use illegal drugs, nor do I have any desire to use \nagain.  \n \nI am a proud mother to a beautiful 7 month old baby girl. I want to be there \nfor her in every way I can, and I want to set a good example for her (and \nfor my future children). I want to continue to be a productive and law-\nabiding member of society. I intend to improve upon myself and build a \ngood life for myself and my family. (Gov 1 at 40-43)  \n \nDespite her good intentions, Applicant used marijuana on two occasions in 2017. \nOn the first occasion, she used marijuana in April 2017 when her cousin died \nunexpectedly. She was at a post-funeral gathering, was drinking alcohol, and admits to \nbeing intoxicated. Her cousin lit up a marijuana joint and Applicant smoked the joint with \nher cousin. The last time she used marijuana was in November 2017. Applicant was on \na business trip.  The hotel where she stayed had free happy hour. Applicant drank \nseveral alcoholic drinks during happy hour.  She stepped outside and a stranger was \noutside smoking a marijuana joint. The stranger offered the joint to Applicant and she \nused the marijuana joint with the stranger. At the time of use, Applicant was aware that \nmarijuana use is illegal under federal law and is against DOD policy. (Tr. 24, 46-51, 59-\n63)   \n \nIn response to interrogatories sworn by Applicant on February 9, 2018, Applicant \nclarified some inaccuracies in the sworn statement she provided during a background \ninvestigation interview on June 6, 2017.  In response to Item: 014 of her Personal \nSubject Interview, Applicant commented: \n\n5 \n \nInvestigator states \u201cSubject\u2019s last use of marijuana was on 01/2017\u201d \u2013 this \nis incorrect, last use at the time was 4/2017.  Investigator also stated \n\u201csubject smoked by herself\u201d \u2013 this is incorrect; I was at a family gathering \nafter a funeral service and smoked with a cousin. Investigator also stated: \n\u201cSubject states she smokes about one a year, but stopped after 01/2017 \ndue to having a new baby and a new job.\u201d  - This is incorrect; I stopped \nsmoking marijuana around 2007 and did not smoke again until 2015 (I had \nmy daughter 11/2014). Use has been very infrequent since 2015. (Gov 2 \nat 3)  \n  \nApplicant testified she had been drinking alcohol on both occasions when she \nused marijuana in 2017.  Drinking alcohol made her uninhibited. She claims that she did \nnot abuse alcohol. She never got into trouble. Eventually, she realized the connection of \nher alcohol use and her decision to use marijuana. Applicant claims she would not have \nused marijuana if she had not been drinking. Applicant sought help by attending \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and developed a support system around her. She attends \nAA meetings. She has a sponsor and attends a home group. She claims AA helped her \nlook at her life defects and helped her to become a better person. Her life is now \ndifferent and she has a strong network of friends. (Tr. 28-29) \n \nApplicant attends two AA meetings each week. During the Sunday meeting, she \nmakes coffee and helps out in a service position. She also attends a program called \nCelebrate Recovery which is a church-based 12 step program that she attends on \nFriday night with her daughter.  Applicant explained the 12 steps as well as the books \nthat she uses in the program. She recently received her one-year chip celebrating her \nsobriety. She has abstained from alcohol for a year. She abstained from marijuana for 1 \n\u00bd years. Her last use of illegal opiates was over 10 years ago. Applicant\u2019s definition of \nsobriety is abstinence from all mind-altering substances. Her goal is to continue to work \nthe program and help others with sobriety. (Tr. 29-36) \n \nApplicant admits that she did not dedicate herself to her previous treatment \nprograms. She claims the difference is now she is actually working the program. \nAttending AA has been a blessing for Applicant. Attending meetings helps her maintain \nsobriety. She is happier when she is helping other people and working on herself. \nApplicant testified that her sober life is too important to give up. (Tr. 37-40, 68)  \n \n \nMs. S., Applicant\u2019s AA Sponsor, testified during the hearing.  She is retired and \nhas never held a security clearance. She met Applicant over a year ago at an AA \nmeeting.  After the meeting, Applicant approached her and asked if she would be her \nsponsor. As a sponsor, she provides support and helps Applicant work through the 12 \nsteps. She says Applicant has worked hard at her steps and has an understanding of \nwhat happened in her life and how her life is now different. She has seen a lot of \nchanges in Applicant over the past year.  Applicant now has a fine appreciation of the \ngifts that she has in her life. She also understands that she cannot use any kind of \nsubstance that is considered a drug. Ms. S. testified, \u201cA drug is a drug is a drug. \nWhether it be a legal drug, illegal drug, or alcohol. It is a mind-altering substance.\u201d (Tr. \n79-83) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nMs. S. testified that Applicant not only attends meetings, but is a home group \nmember. She took a service position and developed close friendships with people who \nare living sober lives and getting their lives on track. (Tr. 81)  Applicant understands that \nwhen she drinks alcohol, she is at risk of using drugs. Ms. S. said that Applicant went to \ngreat lengths to become clean and sober. She meets with Applicant every Sunday and \ntalks to her several times during the week. Applicant has reading assignments. The \nassignments are used to gain a clear understanding of what recovery means. (Tr. 81, \n83-84) \n \nOver the past year, Applicant has become more self-aware. She is honest and \nopen. She is working on making amends to her family and other people. She is \naccountable for her actions. She is aware of the damage she caused and the underlying \ncircumstances. Applicant has a good grasp on recovery. She sometimes needs \nencouragement, but understands that this is \u201ca life and death business.\u201d She is very \nproud that Applicant recently received her one year chip. Applicant has worked very \nhard in achieving and maintaining sobriety. She believes that Applicant will maintain \nsobriety indefinitely. (Tr. 85-91)   \n \nApplicant provided a formal statement indicating that she has no future intent to \nuse any illegal controlled substances or abuse prescription drugs. She is willing to \nundergo random drug testing and agrees to be subject to revocation of her security \nclearance in the event of any future positive drug test.  (AE A Tab 13, Exhibit G)  \n \nWhole-Person Factors \n \n \nMs. B., Applicant\u2019s current supervisor, testified on her behalf. She currently holds \na secret clearance and has an interim top secret clearance. She met Applicant in the fall \n2015. They were co-workers at Contractor 1. They became friends outside of work as \nwell. Applicant left to work for Contractor 2 for about a year. She returned in February \n2018. Ms. B. became her supervisor when she returned. Ms. B. describes Applicant\u2019s \nduty performance as excellent. (Tr. 71-72) \n \nMs. B. is aware of the SOR allegations. She is aware that Applicant used \nmarijuana while holding an interim security clearance. During the year Applicant worked \nContractor 2, Applicant told Ms. B. that while she was on official travel she got drunk \nand smoked marijuana. Applicant told Ms. B. that she needed help because her drinking \nwas impairing her decision making. Applicant then began to attend AA and another \nchurch-based recovery program. (Tr. 72-74) \n \n \nMs. B. would not recommend someone for a security clearance who is currently \nusing illegal drugs. She states that Applicant is a sober person who is taking measures \nto stay sober. She is dedicated to her recovery program. She is aware Applicant attends \nAA meetings as well as another church-based recovery program. Applicant has a strong \nwill to stay sober. Applicant\u2019s husband, family, and co-workers support her efforts to \nstay sober. Ms. B. is confident Applicant will remain sober and has no reservations with \nApplicant holding a security clearance. (Tr. 73-76) Ms. B. also wrote a letter of \nrecommendation on Applicant\u2019s behalf saying similar things. (AE A, Tab 11)  \n \n\n7 \n \n  \nMr. T., the director of IT, Client Solutions, for Applicant\u2019s current employer, has \nknown Applicant for three years. He worked with her on daily basis between May 2015 \nand March 2017. They have also become friends and occasionally socialize outside of \nwork. He has reviewed the SOR and is aware of the nature of the government\u2019s security \nconcerns. He does not believe the allegations are reflective of Applicant\u2019s character, \npatriotism, or willingness or ability to protect classified information. He says Applicant is \none of the most genuine people he knows and possesses a high degree of integrity, \nresponsibility, and honesty. He recommends her for a security clearance. (AE, Tab 8, \nEx F1)  \n \n  \nMr. Y., Applicant\u2019s program manager at Contractor 2, provided a statement \nindicating Applicant was highly recommended candidate for a job as program manager. \nShe interviewed well and was hired. She worked for Contractor 2 from 31 March 2017 \nto 7 February 2018. She left Contractor 2 because of some funding-related work \nstoppages in her division. During her time in Contractor 2\u2019s employ, Mr. Y. found \nApplicant performed at a high level. She was highly dependable and responsible. He is \nfamiliar with the allegations in the SOR, but claims the allegations bear no resemblance \nto the person who he worked with over the past year. They interacted many times \nduring the day when she worked at Contractor 2. She had no appearance of being \nunder the influence or inebriated. She is a self-sufficient and responsible mother. Based \non his interaction with Applicant, he believes the U.S. Government would benefit from \nApplicant being granted a security clearance. He believes the issues alleged in the SOR \nhave been resolved. She sought help, got clean, and turned her life around. Mr. Y. \nstates, \u201cBased on my time working with [Applicant] she is concentrating her time and \nefforts on expanding her professional skill set, maintaining a great work ethic, raising \nher family, and moving on from her past indiscretions. I feel that if allowed to continue \nworking as a cleared employee she would continue down this path.\u201d (AE A, Tab 10, \nExhbit F3) \n \n  \nOne Applicant\u2019s co-workers and her former boyfriend\u2019s sister provided favorable \nreference letters on her behalf. (AE A, Tab 9 , Ex F2 and Tab 12, EX F5)  Applicant \nprovided copies of her 2015, 2016, and 2017 Performance Reviews. All were favorable. \n(AE A, Tabs 1 -4).  Applicant often contributes to local charities and \u201cGo Fund Me\u201d \ncauses. (AE A, Tabs 6-7)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\n8 \n \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24:       \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove.  \n \n\n9 \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \nAG & 25(a) any substance misuse; \n \nAG & 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG & 25(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of substance use disorder;    \n \nAG & 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; and \n \nAG & 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse.  \n  \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits to a long history of polysubstance abuse \nfrom 1996 to November 2017, including marijuana, cocaine (to include crack cocaine), \nOxyContin, Oxycodone, Heroin, and Methadone. At times, Applicant illegally purchased \nand possessed illegal substances.  AG & 25(a) and AG & 25(c) apply.   \n \nApplicant was treated by Dr. R. for Drug Dependence (Opiates) from May 2012 \nto November 2013, and received treatment at an institute from April 2007 to May 2011 \nfor drug dependence. AG & 25(d) applies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred on two occasions in 2017, after she \nhad been granted an interim security clearance.  AG & 25(f) applies.  I find AG & 25(g) \napplies because although she stated on her June 2015 security clearance questionnaire  \nthat she had no desire to use illegal drugs again, she illegally used marijuana in April \n2017 and November 2017.      \n  \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n  \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \n\n10 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG & 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n     \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurred in \nNovember 2017, after she had been granted an interim security clearance. Applicant\u2019s \nlast use occurred with a stranger when she was on travel for her employer. This raises \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. Such \nconduct made her vulnerable to being compromised. Considering her long history of \npolysubstance abuse, it is too soon to conclude that she will remain drug free.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies in that Applicant has not used illegal drugs since \nNovember 2017, and she signed a statement of intent to refrain from all illegal drug \ninvolvement. However, this mitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant \nstated on her June 2015 security clearance questionnaire that she had no intent to use \nillegal drugs in the future, yet she illegally used marijuana on two occasions after being \ngranted an interim security clearance. \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes.  \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n\n11 \n \n \nAG & 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if know, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.   \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s marijuana use of two occasions after being \ngranted a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana in June and November 2017  \nraises issues about her judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. This raises doubts as to Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information.   \n \n \nAG & 16(e) applies because Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use has the potential to \naffect her personal, professional, or community standing. When Applicant used \nmarijuana she was a mature woman. Despite her past history of illegal drug use, she \nwas given the opportunity to demonstrate her trustworthiness and was granted an \ninterim security clearance. She abused that trust and demonstrated poor judgment \nwhen opting to use marijuana on two occasions after being granted an interim security \nclearance.   \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \nAG & 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. While Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred about a \nyear ago, it is considered recent. Considering her long history of illegal drug use, not \nenough time has passed to conclude that Applicant will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies because Applicant acknowledged her mistakes and has been \nan active member of AA for over a year.  She is taking steps to deal with her problems. \nHowever, not enough time has passed to demonstrate that Applicant will remain drug \nfree in the future. \n\n12 \n \n \n \nAG & 17(e) applies because Applicant has openly disclosed her illegal drug use. \nThis mitigating condition is given less weight because Applicant\u2019s most recent use of \nmarijuana occurred on two occasions after being granted an interim security clearance. \nApplicant was aware that marijuana was illegal under federal law and against DOD \npolicy. Serious questions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a devoted wife and mother. She is well regarded by her supervisor \nand co-workers. She should be commended for working on her addiction issues and \nearning her bachelor\u2019s degree. I found Applicant to be honest during the hearing. \nHowever, serious questions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of her \ndecision to illegally use marijuana on two occasions after being granted an interim \nsecurity clearance. While Applicant is commended for seeking help through AA, after \nher last use of marijuana, it is too soon to conclude there is no risk in granting Applicant \na security clearance based on her long history of polysubstance abuse. In cases where \nthere is doubt, I am required to rule in favor of national security. Security concerns \nunder Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n13 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $102,076 for five delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.e), two of which (SOR 1.c and 1.d) were for unpaid federal income tax liens totaling $71,886.78. The SOR also alleged that in June 2002, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition through which his debts were discharged in November 2002 (SOR 1.f). In response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 1.a, asserting that he had been repaying the debt through an agreement with the creditor established before the SOR was issued. He denied SOR 1.b, asserting that he had repaid the debt before he received the SOR (the last payment was made on October 31, 2017; Applicant signed for the SOR on November 28, 2017). Applicant admitted SOR 1.c and 1.d, but he asserted that he had entered into an agreement with the IRS to place both liens temporarily into \u201cuncollectible status\u201d so he could resolve his other debts, and that he planned to begin repaying his tax debts in early 2018. Applicant denied SOR 1.e, claiming the debt and the lien enforcing it had already been paid.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn November 17, 2017, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines cited in the SOR were issued \nby the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). Due to \na combination of relocation by the Applicant, hearing officer caseloads, and Applicant\u2019s \nscheduling conflicts, this case was assigned to three previous administrative judges. I \nreceived the case on March 11, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing on April 16, \n2019. The parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on May 2, 2019. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 9. \nApplicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) 1 \u2013 8. GX 3, 4, and 8 were \nadmitted over Applicant\u2019s objections. (Tr. 22 \u2013 25, 27 \u2013 32) All other exhibits were \nadmitted without objection and the record closed on April 16, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nOn April 18, 2019, Applicant submitted 14 pages of additional information. He sent \nthe documents by email simultaneously to me and to Department Counsel. At the hearing, \nI did not make any provision for post-hearing submissions. Nonetheless, Department \nCounsel has not filed any objection to Applicant\u2019s documents, which I have marked as \nAX 9, and they are admitted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $102,076 for five \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.e), two of which (SOR 1.c and 1.d) were for \nunpaid federal income tax liens totaling $71,886.78. The SOR also alleged that in June \n2002, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition through which his debts were \ndischarged in November 2002 (SOR 1.f). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 1.a, asserting that he had been \nrepaying the debt through an agreement with the creditor established before the SOR \nwas issued. He denied SOR 1.b, asserting that he had repaid the debt before he received \nthe SOR (the last payment was made on October 31, 2017; Applicant signed for the SOR \non November 28, 2017). Applicant admitted SOR 1.c and 1.d, but he asserted that he \nhad entered into an agreement with the IRS to place both liens temporarily into \n\u201cuncollectible status\u201d so he could resolve his other debts, and that he planned to begin \nrepaying his tax debts in early 2018. Applicant denied SOR 1.e, claiming the debt and the \nlien enforcing it had already been paid. Finally, Applicant admitted SOR 1.f, but asserted \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nthat the bankruptcy action was taken 15 years ago and has no relevance to an \nassessment of his current suitability for access to classified information. (Answer; Tr. 12 \n\u2013 14) \n \n \nIn support of his response, Applicant provided documents that show, as of the date \nof his Answer, he has been paying the SOR 1.a debt on a monthly or near-monthly basis \nsince March 2015; that the SOR 1.b debt was resolved in October 2017; that the SOR \n1.e debt and a lien enforcing that debt also had been resolved in August and November \n2017, respectively. Applicant\u2019s Answer also included documentation of his agreement \nwith the IRS in January 2016 to hold his tax debts (SOR 1.c and 1.d) in abeyance. \n \n \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by the \ninformation presented with his Answer, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and has worked as a certified information technology (IT) \nspecialist since at least June 2001. He started working for defense contractors in \nNovember 2010 and first received a security clearance in March 2011. Between \nNovember 2010 and February 2015, he worked on a series of military support contracts \nand was located in Afghanistan. Thereafter, he worked until August 2015 on a similar \ncontract in South Korea. From December 2015 until July 2018, he was assigned to a \nmilitary support contract in State A. Since then, he has worked on a different military \nsupport contract in State B. Applicant produced ten letters of recommendation and \nsupport that portray him as professional, hardworking, trustworthy, and reliable. He also \nreceived numerous awards and other forms of recognition and appreciation from his \nmilitary customers for his work in or near combat zones in Afghanistan. (GX 1; GX 7; Tr. \n65 \u2013 68) \n \n \nApplicant was married from July 2003 until divorcing in April 2006. He remarried in \nJuly 2011, but divorced in August 2012. Applicant has one child (now 11 years old) with \na third woman with whom he lived between 2006 and 2009. Since April 2014, that woman \nand their child lived, with Applicant when he was between contracts, in a house Applicant \nhas owned in State C since April 2014. The debt alleged at SOR 1.e is for a lien against \nthat property that arose from the woman\u2019s failure to pay homeowners association (HOA) \ndues; however, she paid that debt in August 2017 and the lien was removed in November \n2017. (Answer; GX 2; GX AX 5; Tr. 62 \u2013 63, 103) \n \n \nBetween November 2010 and February 2014, Applicant worked on a series of \ncontracts for two defense contractors at a forward operating base (FOB) in Afghanistan. \nWhen he was hired by the second contractor in late 2011, he was asked to complete an \nIRS form to be used in calculating his tax obligations for income earned overseas. He \nwas unsure how to complete the form and asked fellow employees and his manager for \nguidance. He submitted the form based on the information they provided; however, their \nadvice was incorrect. As a result, Applicant\u2019s employer did not withhold enough income \ntax from his paycheck for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. On July 31, 2014, the IRS filed a \ntax lien against Applicant to protect and enforce a $28,441.31 debt for unpaid taxes in the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n2012 tax year. On August 31, 2015, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant to protect \nand enforce a $43,445.47 debt for unpaid taxes in the 2013 tax year. (Answer; GX 2; GX \n7; GX 9; AX 3; AX 4; Tr. 53 \u2013 55, 126) \n \n \nAfter he completed his work in Afghanistan in February 2014, Applicant was hired \nby another defense contractor for work in Korea. He lived and worked there between April \n2014 and August 2015. While he was in Korea, he learned of the tax liens against him \nand contacted the IRS to resolve his debts through repayment plans. Around July 2014, \nhe also received unsolicited calls and emails from companies specializing in tax relief and \nclaiming to help him resolve his obligations for far less than the debt he actually owed. \nApplicant hired one of those companies (GTS) for $10,000 but soon realized their plan \nwould not resolve his tax debt. In 2015, he hired another company (TDN) who contacted \nthe IRS on his behalf. At that time, Applicant was out of work, having been laid off by his \nemployer at the end of their contract in Korea. The IRS agreed to place Applicant\u2019s 2012 \nand 2013 tax debts in an uncollectable status because of his financial situation. Under \nthat agreement, the liens would remain in place to protect the IRS\u2019s interests; Applicant \nwould claim zero exemptions from income tax withholding; interest would continue to \naccrue; and Applicant would not have to make payments until such time as the IRS \ndetermined he was again able to pay his debts. (Answer; GX 7; AX 3; AX 4; Tr. 56 \u2013 59, \n86 \u2013 88, 128) \n \n \nAfter his contract in Korea ended, Applicant was unemployed between August \n2015 and December 2015. His company then rehired him for work at a military installation \nin State A. When Applicant was sent to Korea, his employer paid him a monthly stipend \nfor housing. That money was provided separate from Applicant\u2019s paycheck and was not \nreduced by income tax withholdings, and it covered Applicant\u2019s housing expenses in \nKorea. Applicant was supposed to receive money for relocation and a four-month housing \nstipend, under the same payment arrangements as in Korea, to pay for his housing while \nworking in State A; however, when the housing stipend began in January 2016, it was \nreduced through income tax withholdings. The result was that Applicant did not have \nenough money to pay for both his State A and State C residences. Not only was he still \nunable to start repaying his IRS debts, he accrued additional debts, two of which (SOR \n1.a and 1.b) were alleged in the SOR. Although Applicant\u2019s employer eventually made \ngood on the shortfall in his stipend, Applicant had already fallen behind on some of his \ndebts. And after the four-month stipend period ended, he had to support two residences. \nSince July 2018, Applicant\u2019s current employer in State B has paid all of his State B living \nand transportation expenses, thus alleviating Applicant\u2019s dual residence expenses. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 9; AX 9; Tr. 73 \u2013 82, 119 \u2013 122) \n \n \nApplicant started repaying, and is still repaying, the SOR 1.a debt in March 2015. \nTo date, he consistently has made at least 48 monthly payments averaging $300 as part \nof a resolution agreed to by the creditor. The total paid up to April 2019 is about half the \namount alleged in SOR 1.a. In October 2017, Applicant completed a repayment \nagreement to resolve the SOR 1.b debt. (Answer; AX 1; AX 2; Tr. 83 \u2013 86) \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn the first half of 2018, Applicant and TDN began working with the IRS to start \nrepaying his tax debts. Applicant testified that the whole process took several months as \nhe responded to IRS requests for information. In January 2018, Applicant\u2019s income had \nincreased to a point where he could cover all of his regular expenses, as well as his other \ndebts, and commit to a meaningful repayment plan with the IRS. Before that agreement \nwas finalized, Applicant of his own accord made payments in August and September \ntotaling $2,315. On November 15, 2018, TDN notified Applicant the IRS had approved a \nrepayment plan beginning in December 2018, whereby Applicant is to pay $1,431 each \nmonth on a total tax debt of $98,756. That figure includes Applicant\u2019s tax liabilities for \n2012 through 2017. The additional tax years were included, ostensibly, because \nretroactive correction of his 2012 and 2013 returns affected subsequent filings and tax \nliabilities. As of the hearing, Applicant had timely made the required payments via \nautomatic bank account deductions starting in December 2018. It does not appear that \nApplicant has ever failed to file his income tax returns as required. (Answer; AX 3; AX 4; \nTr. 15, 59 \u2013 60, 86 \u2013 92) \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial problems in the past. In 2002, he filed for and \nreceived Chapter 7 liquidation of his then-existing debts. The record does not contain \ninformation about the amount of debt that was liquidated or the circumstances that led to \nhis decision to file bankruptcy. When he submitted an e-QIP in 2010, Applicant disclosed \n15 delinquent or past-due debts totaling $7,435. During a November 2010 subject \ninterview during the ensuing background investigation, Applicant explained that his debts \narose from a combination of his 2006 divorce and a period of unemployment. Many of the \ndebts he disclosed had already been paid when he submitted his e-QIP. During the 2011 \nadjudication of his clearance, he provided O adjudicators with documentation of his efforts \nto resolve his debts and his clearance was granted. (Answer; AX 6; AX 8; Tr. 94 - 101) \n \n \nApplicant has not incurred any new delinquencies in addition to those alleged in \nthe SOR. He meets all of his current obligations and, after meeting all of his monthly \nexpenses including tax lien payments and payment of the SOR 1.a debt, he has a \nsignificant positive cash flow. Applicant also has had to pay for unexpected events, \nincluding family emergencies, and he has repaid earlier personal loans from family \nmembers who helped him when he was struggling. Currently, Applicant and TDN are \nnegotiating with the IRS to subordinate the tax liens against him so he can refinance the \nmortgage on his house. He hopes to use an estimated $40,000 in available equity to \naccelerate repayment of his tax debts. (Answer; Tr. 101 \u2013 116, 130 \u2013 131) \n \n \nApplicant has an excellent reputation among his professional and personal \nassociates. Numerous letters of recommendation voice support based on the authors\u2019 \npositive observations of Applicant\u2019s work ethic, professionalism, integrity, and \ntrustworthiness. Each of his references expressed, without reservation, their confidence \nin Applicant\u2019s ability and willingness to protect sensitive information and in his \ncommitment to the government and military missions he supports. His references \nrepresent a cross section of Applicant\u2019s military, governmental, private industry, and \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \ncommunity interactions. Applicant also has been personally recognized for his work in \nsupport of forward-deployed military organizations. (Answer; AX 7; AX 8; Tr. 131)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that, since 2012, Applicant incurred delinquent or \npast-due debts, including significant unpaid income taxes, totaling $102,076. Available \ninformation also shows that he has experienced financial problems on at least two other \noccasions since 2002. That information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nI also considered, in response to Department Counsel\u2019s arguments, potential \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so); \nhowever, the available mitigating information about Applicant\u2019s repayment efforts, \ndiscussed below, precludes a conclusion that Applicant was unwilling to repay his debts. \nFurther, the record also requires application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial problems arose from a period of unemployment that \noccurred around the time he unexpectedly incurred a large income tax debt. As to his \ntaxes, it does not appear that Applicant engaged in any deceptive practices or that he \nfailed to file his tax returns at any time. Rather, he followed inaccurate guidance about \nhow to have his income taxes withheld while working overseas. In 2014, as soon as he \nbecame aware of the two tax liens against him, he engaged the first of two income tax \nresolution companies in an effort to negotiate with the IRS about his debts. In late 2015, \nbefore a payment plan could be established, he lost his job and the IRS agreed to hold \nhis tax debt in abeyance as \u201cuncollectable.\u201d Around the same time, Applicant\u2019s lost \nemployment resulted in other delinquent or past-due debts; however, since early 2017, \nApplicant has been repaying those debts through consistent monthly payments. The SOR \n1.a debt is now about half what it was, and the SOR 1.b and 1.e debts have been resolved. \nJust as in 2010 and 2011, available information shows Applicant has been proactive in \naddressing his debts and that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. As to \nhis Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002, nothing more than the fact of his filing and discharge \ncan be discerned from the record. That information does not weigh one way or the other \nin an assessment of Applicant\u2019s current financial circumstances. \n \n \nMost of the focus in this case is placed, correctly, on Applications efforts to resolve \nhis unpaid taxes. Here, the IRS agreed that his debt was, for a time, \u201cuncollectable.\u201d This \nallowed Applicant to resolve other non-tax debts and to recover his financial footing. In \npursuing this course of action, Applicant\u2019s tax debt has grown through interest, penalties, \nand the consolidation of additional years of tax adjustments. But well before the SOR was \nissued, Applicant was working with the IRS through TDN to establish a repayment plan,  \nwhich he has been following since December 2018. In view of his current financial stability \nand his track record of following through on his debt resolution efforts, it is likely he will \ncontinue to make his IRS payments as required. \n \n \nFinancial problems present a two-fold inquiry. First, does the ongoing presence of \nunpaid debt or other unresolved financial burdens present a likelihood that Applicant \nwould resort to illegal acts or other conduct that might compromise national interests? \nHere, that appears highly unlikely. Applicant is an experienced and well-respected IT \nprofessional with a long record of excellent performance and reliability. His record in direct \nsupport of the military in a combat zone exhibits a sense of integrity and trustworthiness \nin dealing with sensitive information. Additionally, the manner in which he has responded \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nto his financial problems is indicative of a willingness to resolve his debts and further \nmanage his finances through responsible and prudent measures. \n \n \nSecond, did Applicant\u2019s financial problems arise from irresponsible decisions, poor \njudgment, or other factors that indicate he is unreliable or untrustworthy? I conclude they \ndid not. Applicant is in the midst of resolving debts that arose from, or were exacerbated \nby, a period of unemployment and an unintentional mistake in submitting tax-reporting \ninformation through his employer while overseas. The record as a whole establishes that \nthose circumstances are unlikely to recur and that Applicant is now better equipped to \nmanage his finances so they will not be a security concern in the future. On balance, \navailable information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s job performance and \nreputation in the workplace. Most notably, Applicant\u2019s positive reputation, as well as \nseveral positive observations about his judgment and reliability, are rooted in his work in \ndirect support of forward-deployed military organizations and missions involving the \nsafeguarding of sensitive information. Additionally, his actions to resolve his debts evince \na conscientiousness about his obligations and responsibilities that reflects well on his \nsuitability for continued access to classified information. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns about his financial problems. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant provided sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for \nhandling protected information under Guideline K. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant was granted eligibility for access to classified information in June 1984. \nApplicant submitted his latest Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) to retain his eligibility for access to classified information required for \nemployment by a defense contractor on July 12, 2017. (Government Exhibit (GX 1)) \nAn incident report in the Joint Personnel Adjudication system (JPAS), dated April \n17, 2017, listed three security violations by Applicant. (GX 2) The first incident was on \nNovember 29, 2016; the second was on January 9, 2017; and the third was on March 8, \n2017. On November 27, 2017, the Department of Defense issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reason (SOR) detailing security concerns for protecting protected \ninformation under Guideline K. The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 15, 2017, admitting the three \nallegations of deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information under Guideline K. He provided explanations for his \nmishandling of protected information on the three occasions. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on January 29, 2018, and I was assigned the case on July 14, \n2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non September 20, 2018, for a hearing on November 14, 2018. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. The Government\u2019s two exhibits (GX 1 and 2) were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant and three witnesses testified. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on November 26, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are included in my findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of the pleadings, hearing transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He received a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer \nScience in February 1981. He has never served in the military. He has worked as an \nOracle data base administrator for defense contractors since 2007. He first married in \n1981, divorced in 1993, and married again in 2002. He has five children. (GX 1, e-QIP, \ndated July 12, 2017) \n \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s work was performed in a Special Compartmented \nInformation Facility (SCIF). The SOR alleges three incidents of Applicant failing to \nproperly secure the door to the SCIF as required by security procedures. There was no \ncompromise of classified information as a result of the incidents. \n \n \nApplicant had shoulder surgery on October 4, 2016. He was in pain for a few \nweeks after the surgery, not sleeping well, and taking narcotic pain relievers. He was \ncleared by his doctor to return to work by late October. 2016. He continued with physical \ntherapy until early spring 2017. (Tr. 11-14) \n \n \nThe first incident (SOR 1.a) was on November 29, 2016. Applicant admitted he \ndid not properly secure the door to the SCIF. The required procedure was for the last \nperson to use the SCIF in a day to lock the door by spinning the dial, setting the alarm, \nand signing the security check sheet. If you were not the last person to use the SCIF in \na day, an individual just closed the door and spun the combinations locking dial. There \nwas no requirement to set the alarm or sign a security check sheet.  \n \n \nOn November 29, 2016, Applicant did not believe he was the last person that \nwould use the SCIF that day. However, he did not check with the person that he \nbelieved would use the SCIF after him to be assured that some would follow him to use \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe SCIF. Applicant just closed the door and spun the dial. He did not set the alarm or \nsign the check sheet. The failure to set the alarm and sign the check sheet was \ndiscovered later that evening by building security. Applicant was verbally counseled by \nhis supervisor and reread the security procedure guide. (Tr. 14-18) \n \n \nThe second incident occurred on January 9, 2017. Applicant\u2019s wife called him at \nabout 1730, and told him that there was an emergency issue with one of his children. \nHe left work immediately to assist his wife. The SCIF was not secured and the proper \nprocedures were not followed. Applicant admitted he was the last person in the office \nand should have ensured that the SCIF was secured. He stated he had no excuse and \nhe should have locked the SCIF. He received a written warning from his supervisor and \nwas required to receive extra training on open and close procedures. He also received \nan additional security briefing. (Tr. 18-20) \n \n \nThe third incident happened on March 8, 2017. Applicant could not explain why \nhe did not secure the facility before he departed. He was still in some pain and was \nreceiving physical therapy. But he still had no idea why he did not properly secure the \nfacility that night. (Tr. 20-21) \n \n \nApplicant no longer works on a contract that requires him to open and close a \nSCIF. However, he has thought of procedures he can institute himself to assist him in \nremembering to follow the proper procedures to open and close a facility in the future. \n(Tr. 21-23) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at the time of the three incidents testified that he was \naware that Applicant had surgery in October 2016, was in pain for a time, and taking \nmedication. Applicant was not the only employee that had an issue with securing the \nSCIF. He was informed by building security when the SCIF was not properly locked. He \ndiscussed the first incident with Applicant and determined that he did not need \nadditional training. He decided that their discussion would be sufficient counseling. He \nhad no concern at that time that there would be a similar incident. Applicant did not tell \nhim that his pain was a factor in his failure to secure the facility.  \n \n \nOn the second incident, He gave Applicant a written reprimand. He did not \nremember any reason Applicant provided for his failure the follow procedures. On the \nthird incident, Applicant could not provide a reason for his failure to secure the room. \nApplicant was upset that he did not lock the room. As a result of this incident, the \nwitness removed Applicant\u2019s access to the room. There have been no other security \nincidents involving Applicant either before or after these events. (Tr. 30-38) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s coworkers testified that he has worked with Applicant since \n2015. He knows that Applicant had surgery in October 2016. At the time, Applicant \nlooked like he was in pain and had limited sleep. The witness was only told that there \nwere lapses in properly securing the SCIF. He also knew that Applicant was upset when \nhe realized that he had not properly security the SCIF. At present, Applicant is working \n\n \n4 \n \n \non a non-secure program and does not require access to classified information. He is \nnot aware of any other security breach incidents involving Applicant. (Tr. 39-43) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor testified that he has worked with Applicant for \nabout 18 months. The project they are working does not require them to have open and \nclosing privileges. Applicant is security aware and careful with his work product. His skill \nset is very good. (Tr. 43-47) \n  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.    \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified and sensitive information) \n \nAnalysis \n \nHandling Protected Information: \n \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for handling \nprotected information-which includes classified and other sensitive government \ninformation, \nand \nproprietary \ninformation-raises \ndoubt \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such \ninformation , and is a serious security concern. \n \n \nApplicant three times failed to follow the proper method of securing a SCIF. He \nwas counseled after the first incident and received a written reprimand after the second \nincident. His failures to properly follow the administrative procedures for securing the \nSCIF, in spite of counseling, raises the following protected information disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 34: \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information; and \n \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \n \n \nThere is no evidence in the case file to establish that Applicant\u2019s failure to \nproperly secure the SCIF resulted in any damage to the national security. In fact, the \nevidence shows that there was no compromise of classified information. The \ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b634 (i) (failure to comply with rules and regulations that \nresult in damage to the national security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or \nnegligence) is not raised. \n  \n \nI have considered the following mitigating conditions under (AG \u00b6 35): \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude towards the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; \n  \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and \n \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was properly reported, the is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n \n \nThe mitigating conditions apply. Applicant violations were acts of omission not \ncommission. He violated administrative rules in the proper method to lock and secure a \nSCIF. Applicant had open and close privileges for a SCIF for many years with no other \nreported violations. The three incidents happened in a four month period, the last about \ntwo years ago. There has not been a violation of security procedures by Applicant since. \nThe three violations are not recent and frequent. There have been only these three \nsecurity procedure violations by Applicant in over 30 years of holding a security \nclearance. The three violations were while Applicant was in pain from a shoulder \nsurgery and while taking narcotic and other pain medications. The violations are not \nlikely to happen again. Based on the testimony of his supervisor, Applicant responded \nfavorably to counseling. He was warned and counseled. He showed remorse for his \nviolations and responded favorably to the counseling. Applicant presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate the allegations of mishandling protected information by \nnegligently not following proper procedure for securing a SCIF.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s many years \nof working for defense contractors. Applicant\u2019s failure to follow the proper administrative \nprocedures for securing a SCIF was not a deliberate act but an act of omission. Under \nthe circumstances, his conduct does not raise questions about his judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to comply with rules and regulations. He adequately \narticulated the circumstances and reasons for his mishandling of the proper procedures \nand mitigated the security violations. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions and doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nHe established his suitability for access to classified information. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from mishandling of \nprotected information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 24, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 14, 2018, and March 12, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 3, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \n12/21/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing on September 5, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 17, \n2018. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were \nadmitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on October 24, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 1.p, 1.q, 1.u \nthrough 1.w, 1.aa, and 1.dd through 1.kk. She denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.m, \n1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, 1.x, 1.y, 1.z, 1.bb, and 1.cc stating they were duplicates of debts she \nadmitted. She did not respond to SOR \u00b6 1.ll, and it will be considered a denial. She \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, stating she made an error. Her \nexplanation will be considered denials for those two allegations. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. She married in 2003. She and her husband have been \nseparated at different times, but are reconciled. They have two children, ages 27 and 20 \nyears old. In 2010, she earned an associate\u2019s degree.1 \n \nApplicant disclosed on her May 2016 security clearance application (SCA) that she \nhad been employed by a federal contractor since May 2013, but has had periods of \nunemployment due to contract changes. Applicant has had other periods of \nunemployment to include: February 2018 to May 2018; September 2012 to March 2013; \nand May 2011 to August 2011. These may be periods when she was between contracts. \nShe testified that she has been working for a temporary agency since August 2018.2  \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment, underemployment, \nlack of health insurance, and when she and her husband were separated. Their children \nwere minors when they were separated, and he did not pay child support. He occasionally \ncontributed to household expenses. She stated that in May 2011 she lost her job where \nshe had worked for more than seven years. She had some debts at that time. She did not \nearn enough to pay her bills. She lost her health insurance when she was laid off. She \ndid not have medical insurance from approximately 2011 to 2016. She testified that she \nhas not intentionally neglected her debts, but she cannot afford to pay them.3 \n \nApplicant decided to go back to school in 2007 so she could earn more money. \nShe needs three more classes to earn her bachelor\u2019s degree. She accumulated more \nthan $80,000 in student loans. She testified the loans were deferred, and she began \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 17-18. \n \n2 Tr. 18-24. On her SCA, Applicant disclosed she was unemployed from May 2013 to July 2013 and in \nFebruary 2014 which is inconsistent with her disclosure that she has been employed by a federal contractor \nsince May 2013.  \n \n3 Tr. 40-45, 66-68. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmaking $120 payments in August 2018. The creditor wanted her to pay $400, but she \nwas able to defer that amount for six months. She testified that she now has a budget \nand has $218 remaining at the end of the month after paying her bills.4  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, bankruptcy documents, and credit reports from September \n2017 and July 2016, corroborate the SOR allegations.5 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.s. 1.t, 1.y, 1.bb \nand 1.cc are duplicate accounts of other allegations. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor on these \nallegations.6  \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and her debts were \ndischarged in May 2003. She stated that she had two credit cards and medical debts, and \nshe was not managing her money properly at the time. The amount of the debts that were \ndischarged is unknown.7  \n \nIn February 2018, Applicant again filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Her debts were \ndischarged in May 2018. It appears that the debts alleged in the SOR are included in this \nbankruptcy petition. The debts discharged were medical, a vehicle loan, a credit card, \nsatellite television, cell phone, and for an apartment. She stated a medical creditor placed \na lien on her checking account for a debt she owed from 2012, so she had to pay $75 a \nmonth beginning in October 2017. She stated this payment was to a collection agency. \nShe stopped paying the account when she filed bankruptcy. She stated she also owed \nher state taxing authority for failure to have insurance. She had a $100 balance and \nplanned to pay it in two increments by November 2018. Applicant testified that prior to her \nbankruptcy she was making small payments on some delinquent accounts.8  \n \nIn April 2014, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Questionnaire. Under \nSection 22, it asked if she was over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial \nobligations. She answered \u201cno.\u201d At the time, Applicant had numerous delinquent debts \nthat she failed to disclose.9  \n \nWhen Applicant completed her SCA in May 2016, she answered \u201cno\u201d to all of the \nquestions under Section 26, Financial Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts, which \nasked if in the past seven years she had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; \nand if she had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or canceled for failing \nto pay as agreed.  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 45-49, 61. \n \n5 GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A. \n \n6 Applicant claimed other allegations were also duplicates. A review of the evidence supports that these \naccounts have different numbers and were opened on different dates. See GE 2 and 3.  \n \n7 Tr. 58-59. \n \n8 Tr. 32-58, 69-70, 75-76; GE 4. \n \n9 GE 6. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that she misunderstood the questions when she answered \u201cno.\u201d \nShe said that she believed that she had disclosed on a 2014 Public Trust Position \nQuestionnaire the requested information and her current 2016 SCA had populated the \ninformation, and she did not have to disclose it. She testified that she was aware of her \ndelinquent debts, but did not read the question, did not understand the question, or was \nin a rush when completing the document. She stated she was aware that some medical \ndebts had been turned over to collection accounts. She also had debts that became \ndelinquent after 2013, the date she said she completed an SCA. She also had debts that \nwere more than 180 days when she completed her 2014 Public Trust Position \nQuestionnaire, but did not disclose them on that document. I did not find Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony credible. I find she deliberately failed to disclose her delinquent debts on her \n2014 Public Trust Position Questionnaire and 2016 SCA.10    \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, bankruptcy documents, and credit reports \ncorroborate the SOR allegations. Applicant testified that she completed the financial \ncounseling required to file bankruptcy.11 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n10 Tr. 24-40; GE 1, 6. \n \n11 GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A. I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the \nSOR for disqualifying purposes. I may consider such information when applying the mitigating conditions, \nin making a credibility determination, and in my whole-person analysis.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2012. She \nhad her debts discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant had her debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2003 and again in 2018. \nInsufficient evidence was provided to conclude future financial problems are unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant\u2019s financial history casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to unemployment, underemployment, \nlack of health insurance, and marital separation. These are conditions that were beyond \nher control. Applicant provided minimal evidence of actions she may have taken after her \nfirst bankruptcy to prevent a second one. It appears the lack of health insurance is the \ngreatest impact on Applicant\u2019s finances. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \n \nApplicant completed financial counseling required to file bankruptcy. However, she \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to show her financial situation is under control. She \nestimated she had about $218 a month remaining after paying bills. She obtained a \ndeferment for six months on her student loans and is paying a reduced payment at this \ntime. It is unclear if she has a plan for making the required payments when due. I find AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Although, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been resolved \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthrough bankruptcy again, this does not constitute a good-faith effort to pay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. I find AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.   \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant deliberately did not disclose on her 2014 Position of Public Trust \nQuestionnaire that she had any debts that were delinquent for more than 180 days. \nApplicant was aware of her lack of health insurance, and financial distress. She again \ndeliberately failed to disclose she had any delinquent debts or financial problems when \nshe completed her 2016 SCA. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant made a prompt good-faith effort to \ncorrect the omissions and disclose her financial problems before being confronted. \nApplicant testified that she did not have medical insurance. She was aware of the \nnumerous delinquent medical bills she had because one creditor had placed a lien on her \nchecking account. She stated she received collection notices. Applicant\u2019s failure to \n\n \n8 \n \n \ntruthfully provide answers on a Position of Public Trust Questionnaire in 2014 and an SCA \nin 2016 is not minor. The Government relies on those seeking security clearances to \nhonestly disclose information, which may sometimes be derogatory. Failure to do so \nraises questions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. She had her debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2003. \nShe again filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and her debts were discharged in May 2018. \nShe has an unreliable financial track record, which continues to raise security concerns. \nMore serious is that on her 2014 Public Trust Position Questionnaire and again on her \n2016 SCA, she deliberately failed to disclose any of her derogatory financial issues, as \nwas required. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.r \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.s-1.t: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u-1.x: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.y:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs  1.z-1.aa:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.bb-1cc:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 55 years old. She was widowed in 2012 and remarried in 2017. She is a high school graduate and has worked for her current employer since 2011. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Applicant Exhibit C.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has failed to meet her financial obligations and is therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.i. She denied SOR allegations 1.c through 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j through 1.w. With regard to all of her financial issues Applicant maintained that her late husband took care of the finances until his death.

She did not submit sufficient evidence to show that all the returns \nhave now been filed. She also owes considerable back taxes, and past-due medical bills. \nResulting security concerns were not mitigated. Based upon a review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on December 21, 2015. (Government Exhibit 1.) On January 17, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of \nDefense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, with an attachment, on February 22, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on March 27, 2018. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May \n11, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July 13, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Applicant \nExhibits A through J, which were also admitted without objection. The record remained \nopen at Applicant\u2019s request for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant \nsubmitted Applicant Exhibits K through P in a timely manner. Department Counsel \nobjected to the admission of Applicant Exhibits K, N, O, and P. That objection is overruled \nand the additional exhibits are all admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on July 23, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. She was widowed in 2012 and remarried in 2017. She \nis a high school graduate and has worked for her current employer since 2011. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Applicant Exhibit C.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has failed to meet her financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.i. She denied SOR allegations 1.c \nthrough 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j through 1.w.  \n \n \nWith regard to all of her financial issues Applicant maintained that her late husband \ntook care of the finances until his death. After his passing in 2012 Applicant stated that it \ntook her over two years to begin resolving her financial issues. However, Applicant was \noften vague as to her knowledge of her past, or current, financial situation. (Tr. 42-43, 62-\n65, 77-82.)  \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b that Applicant failed to timely file \nher Federal and state tax returns for at least tax years 2010 through 2015. The SOR was \namended at the hearing to add tax year 2016 in both allegations, in conformity with the \nevidence and in accordance with the Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, \nparagraph E3.1.17. (Tr. 99-101.)  \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) she admitted that she \nhad not filed Federal or state taxes for tax years 2010 through 2014. Asked for the reason \nshe stated, \u201clate husband was the bookkeeper.\u201d  She further stated that she was in the \nprocess of finding out what she owed, that she was obtaining tax help, and that back \ntaxes were being paid through garnishment. \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her Federal tax returns in a timely \nmanner from 2010 to at least 2015.  \n \n \nDocumentation provided by Applicant from the IRS showed that she had not filed \nher 2010 through 2014 Federal tax returns as of November 2017. Applicant testified that \nshe had prepared some of these returns by hand, however she also testified that she did \nnot know if these returns had ever been filed. She also stated that one or more of her \nback tax returns may have been filed by a tax preparer she had hired. (Government \nExhibit 3 at 13-19; Tr. 30, 63-64, 88-89.) \n \n \nDocumentation provided by Applicant from the IRS showed that her 2015 Federal \ntax return was filed August 15, 2016. Additional documentation provided by Applicant \nfrom her accountant showed that her 2016 Federal tax return was to be filed after March \n31, 2018. I find that both returns were filed late. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12; Applicant \nExhibits K and M; Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state tax returns for at least tax \nyears 2010 through 2015. Applicant stated at the hearing that she believed these returns \nhad been filed. However, other than the 2016 state tax return, she submitted no evidence \nsupporting her statement. (Government Exhibit 3 at 21; Applicant Exhibits K and M; Tr. \n35-36, 88-89.) \n \n \nApplicant also testified that she had paid state back taxes through garnishment \nand did not owe any money to the state. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 36-38, 64-69.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant denied in her March 2018 Answer that she owed the Federal \nGovernment $11,108.44 for 2010 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from \nIRS.  \n \n \nDocumentation supplied by Applicant from the IRS showed that she received \nnotice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 18-19.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid \nthrough assignment of her tax refund. However, documentation from the IRS provided by \nApplicant after the hearing showed that she continued to owe $12,998.59 for that tax year. \nThis debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.)   \n \n \n1.d. Applicant denied in her Answer that she owed the Federal Government \n$10,488.53 for 2011 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from IRS.  \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nDocumentation supplied by Applicant from the IRS showed that she received \nnotice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 16-17.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid \nthrough assignment of her tax refund. However, documentation from the IRS provided by \nApplicant after the hearing showed that she continued to owe $12,996.69 for that tax year. \nThis debt is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.) \n \n \n1.e.   Applicant denied in her Answer that she owed the Federal Government \n$40.89 for 2015 back taxes, stating had not received any notice from IRS.  \n \n \nDocumentation supplied by Applicant from the IRS showed that she received \nnotice of this debt in November 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at 12.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she believed all of her Federal back taxes had been paid \nthrough assignment of her tax refund. Documentation from the IRS provided by Applicant \nafter the hearing showed that she had no debt for that tax year. This debt is resolved. \n(Applicant Exhibit P; Tr. 33-35, 84-85.)1 \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted that she owed a medical creditor $457 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing. Applicant testified that she \nhoped to pay this debt by the end of July 2018. She supplied no evidence that showed \nthis debt had been paid or disputed after the hearing. It is not resolved. (Tr. 40-45, 73-\n77.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $38 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no \nlonger showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence \nshowing that her dispute had been accepted. She supplied no evidence that the debt had \nbeen paid or disputed. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 40-45, 73-77.)  \n \n \n1.h. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $37 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no \nlonger showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence \nshowing that her dispute had been accepted. She supplied no evidence that the debt had \nbeen paid or disputed. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 40-45, 73-77.) \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted that she owed a medical creditor $531 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing. Applicant testified that she \nhoped to pay this debt by the end of July 2018. She supplied no evidence that showed \nthis debt had been paid or disputed after the hearing. It is not resolved. (Tr. 40-45, 73-\n77.) \n                                                 \n1 Applicant Exhibit P also showed that Applicant owed $4,412.03 in 2009 back taxes. The existence of this \ndebt cannot be considered in Applicant\u2019s case-in-chief. It can, however, be considered in determining \nmitigation. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \n1.j. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $561 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no \nlonger showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence \nshowing that her dispute had been accepted. She supplied no evidence that the debt had \nbeen paid or disputed. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 40-45, 73-77.) \n \n \n1.k. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $499 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no \nlonger showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence \nshowing that her dispute had been accepted. She supplied no evidence that the debt had \nbeen paid or disputed. It is not resolved.

Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $33 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no \nlonger showed up on her credit report. However, Applicant did not submit any evidence \nshowing that her dispute had been accepted. Applicant Exhibits N and O are copies of \ndispute or resolution letters Applicant sent to this creditor. However, the amounts in the \nletters do not match this debt, so there is no way to know if either letter concerns this \nspecific debt. She supplied no other evidence that the debt had been paid or disputed. It \nis not resolved. (Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 40-45, 73-77.) \n \n \n1.n. Applicant denied that she owed a medical creditor $32 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant testified that she believed she had successfully disputed this debt, since it no \nlonger showed up on her credit report.

(Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 40-45, 73-77.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant has had a successful career over the years. She has received \nrecognition for her work performance. (Applicant Exhibits B and E.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state tax returns, as required, for at least \nfive years. She filed her returns late for tax years 2015 and 2016. She has a substantial \nFederal tax debt that is not yet resolved. In addition, there are substantial past-due \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nmedical debts. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s substantial financial issues, including unpaid \ntaxes, failure to timely file tax returns, and unpaid medical bills: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid Federal back taxes are still due and owing. She presented \ninsufficient evidence to show that the medical debts have been successfully disputed, or \npaid. Applicant did not supply documentation to show that she has filed all of her past-\ndue tax returns. Nor did she submit any evidence to show that she has entered into a \npayment arrangement with the IRS or any state taxing authority, and is in compliance with \nsuch arrangements if she had filed tax returns and owed taxes. AG \u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), and \n(g) do not apply. As stated, allegation 1.e is found for Applicant. \n \nThe death of Applicant\u2019s husband in 2012 undoubtedly caused some of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues. However, during the hearing she showed little understanding of her \nfinancial situation, was unclear as to the actions she had taken, and was vague about the \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nactions she would take in the future. The documentation she presented showed that her \ntax debts were not being resolved voluntarily, when they were resolved at all. Applicant \ndid not present sufficient evidence to show that she acted responsibly after her husband\u2019s \npassing. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nApplicant stated that she had disputed many of the medical debts online through \nthe company that supplied her credit report. She did not have documentary evidence to \nsupport this statement. She did supply two letters disputing debts set forth in her latest \ncredit report. She did not, however, marry those letters up with any of the debts on the \nSOR. Under the circumstances of this case, AG 20(e) does not apply. \n \nApplicant did not mitigate her tax and other financial issues. Guideline F is found \nagainst Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that the back taxes and medical debts were being resolved, \nor that she had filed all of her tax returns. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or \nduress remains undiminished.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Michelle Daugherty, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant and his spouse did not timely file their federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2012 through 2016, or their state income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2014 \nthrough 2016. Applicant and his in-laws had some difficult health issues, but they do not \nfully mitigate Applicant\u2019s inattention to his tax-filing obligations for the past several years. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 8, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n11/01/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 13, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn April 18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On April 23, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for May 15, 2018. \n \nOn May 9, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered her appearance. On May 11, 2018, \nshe requested a continuance, and Department Counsel had no objection. On May 14, \n2018, I cancelled the hearing. On August 6, 2018, I rescheduled the hearing for September \n19, 2018.  \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (GEs 1-5) were admitted. A February 8, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE \n1) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Ten Applicant exhibits (AEs A-J) were \nadmitted in evidence. Applicant and his spouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) \nreceived on October 1, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file his federal (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and state (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016. Applicant \ndenied the allegations and indicated that there were extenuating circumstances. After \nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and a computer network administrator. He has an \nAssociate Degree in applied electronics technology awarded in May 1986. (GE 1; AEs A, I.) \nHe has worked for a succession of defense contractors at the same military installation \nfrom August 1992 to October 2012 and from June 2014 to present. He was granted a \nsecret clearance in 1994 that was renewed in 2007. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. 22-23, 26.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse married in 2002. (GE 1.) She took responsibility for paying \nthe bills and completing and filing their income tax returns from the start of their marriage. \nTheir joint income tax returns were filed on time through tax year 2011, and they received \nrefunds. (Tr. 73-74.) Applicant\u2019s spouse worked full time for a communications company for \nalmost 20 years. In August 2007, she acquired her real estate license. (Tr. 74.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed from October 2012 until June 2014 for medical reasons. \nHe had major surgery in the fall of 2012 and, in June 2013, he developed serious medical \ncomplications that resulted in him being placed in a medically-induced coma for 52 days. \nHe had subsequent medical setbacks. (Tr. 75-81.)  During his lengthy unemployment, \nApplicant\u2019s spouse had a power-of-attorney to handle their finances. She had to reduce her \nwork hours as a realtor to be with him when he was hospitalized, and then care for him \nwhen he was home. Applicant had some unemployment compensation and disability \n\n3 \n \nincome, but he also liquidated a 401(k) of approximately $152,000 in 2013, which paid for \nCOBRA medical insurance coverage and their mortgage when he was out of work. (Tr. 29-\n31, 78-83.) Applicant\u2019s spouse did not file federal or state income tax returns for tax year \n2012, and their federal return for tax year 2013.1 (GEs 1-2; AEs C-D, Tr. 55-57.) Their tax \nreturns were complicated because of several withdrawals from retirement accounts and her \nbusiness expenses as a self-employed realtor. (Tr. 56.) \n \nApplicant returned to work in June 2014 for a defense contractor at a nearby military \ninstallation located in a state that collects taxes on non-residents that earn income in the \nstate. (Tr. 32, 66-67.) Applicant assumed that federal and non-resident state taxes were \nwithheld from his pay. Apparently only recently, he learned that non-resident state income \ntaxes had not been withheld from his pay, and he rectified his withholding issue.2 (Tr. 59.) \n \nOn March 16, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning \nwhether he had failed to file or pay and Federal, state, or other taxes by law or ordinance in \nthe last seven years, Applicant indicated that he had not filed federal or state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 and 2013. He explained that he had been hospitalized for an \nextended time and was not able to file his tax returns for those tax years. During tax year \n2013, he prematurely withdrew retirement assets. He indicated that he would file his 2012 \nand 2013 tax returns at the same time, and that he expected refunds for tax year 2012, \nwhich he would use to pay any taxes owed for 2013. (GE 1.) Applicant relied on his spouse \nto file their income tax returns because she itemized her self-employment expenses. (Tr. \n67.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed their joint federal income tax return for tax year 2012 \non August 3, 2015. On adjusted gross income of $54,999, they were entitled to a $4,889 \nrefund. (AE C.) They filed their federal income tax return for tax year 2013 on August 17, \n2015. On adjusted gross income of $121,052, they underpaid their federal income taxes by \n$6,071 for tax year 2013. Their federal income tax refund for tax year 2012 was applied to \ntheir tax liability for tax year 2013. (AEs C-D.) With assessed penalties and interest, they \nowed approximately $1,618, which they paid. (GE 2; AE D.) Applicant did not present any \ndocumentation of his state income tax return for tax year 2012. Applicant\u2019s spouse testified \nabout 2012 and 2013 that they owed minimal state taxes for one year and were entitled to \na refund of approximately $2,200 for the other tax year. She advised the state to apply it to \nany taxes owed for subsequent tax years. (Tr. 94-95.) \n \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law were both diagnosed with cancer. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse put her realtor license in inactive status, and she took on caregiver responsibilities \n                                                 \n1 It is unclear whether Applicant and his spouse were required to file a state income tax return for tax year \n2013. He was unemployed that entire year, and there is no evidence that his spouse earned income in a state \nthat taxes employment income. There is no evidence that they were required to file a state return because of \nhis premature withdrawal of retirement assets. \n \n2 Applicant did not indicate when he learned state taxes had not been withheld from his pay. His and his \nspouse\u2019s joint income tax return for 2017 shows that no state income taxes were withheld for that tax year. \n(AE H.) What is clear is that no taxes were withheld before 2018, so his rectification of the issue is recent. \n\n4 \n \nfor her parents. Her father died in early September 2018. (Tr. 85-86, 98.) She felt \noverwhelmed by all of her obligations, and she did not file Applicant and her joint federal or \nstate income tax returns when they were due for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Tr. 69.) \nApplicant took no responsibility for filing their returns. His spouse had gathered most of the \npaperwork and thought she could handle it. (Tr. 99.)  \n \nOn May 3, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that he and his spouse had yet to \nfile their federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015, but that his \nspouse was working on them. He expressed hope that she would complete their returns for \n2014 and 2015 within the next week. He also indicated that their delinquent tax returns for \n2012 and 2013 were filed late; that they owed no federal or state income taxes for tax year \n2012, or state income taxes for 2013; and that they have paid their federal tax debt of \nabout $1,500 for tax year 2013. Applicant expected to owe no tax debt for tax years 2014 \nand 2015. He told the OPM investigator that he and his spouse \u201cjust now have time to sit \ndown and figure [their taxes] out.\u201d  (GE 2.) \n \nIn September 2017, the DOD CAF requested information from Applicant about his \ntax situation. On September 22, 2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse indicated that she is responsible \nfor their tax filing and that she was \u201calmost finished with 2014 and have 2015 and 2016 set \nup to complete as possible.\u201d She requested an extension of time for Applicant because of \nhealth issues with her parents, and she is their closest caregiver. Applicant was granted an \nextension to October 23, 2017, to respond to the DOD CAF\u2019s request. On October 27, \n2017, Applicant\u2019s spouse responded that they worked hard to meet the deadline but \n\u201ccircumstances beyond [their] control have made it impossible to get all the returns \ncompleted.\u201d Applicant\u2019s spouse indicated that her father was scheduled for upcoming \nsurgery, and she asked for more time. She added that she would continue to work on \ncompleting their tax returns. (GE 5.) \n \nOn December 8, 2017, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his \nfailure to file federal and state tax returns by the filing deadlines for tax years 2012 through \n2016. In February 2018, Applicant and his spouse retained the services of an enrolled tax \nagent to assist them in preparing their delinquent income tax returns for tax years 2014 \nthrough 2016. (Tr. 87-88.) \n \n With the assistance of the tax agent, Applicant and his spouse filed their federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 on June 13, 2018. (AEs F-G.) Their state \nincome tax returns were for tax years 2015 and 2016 were completed on June 13, 2018, \nbut were not mailed until the week of September 9, 2018. (Tr. 98.) On joint adjusted gross \nincome of $57,384 in 2015, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $798. Their refund \nwas issued to them on July 9, 2018. (AE F.) No state taxes had been withheld from his pay \nfor tax year 2015, which resulted in a tax underpayment of $1,420. With penalties for late \npayment, they owed state taxes of $1,987 for tax year 2015. (AE F.) On adjusted gross \nincome of $57,159 in 2016, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $666. Their refund \nwas issued to them on July 9, 2018. No state taxes were withheld from his pay for tax year \n\n5 \n \n2016, and with penalties for failure to timely file and pay, they owed $1,747 in state taxes \nfor tax year 2016. (AE G.) \n \nThrough the enrolled tax agent, Applicant and his spouse requested an extension to \nOctober 15, 2018, to file their federal tax return for tax year 2017. On June 13, 2018, they \ntimely filed their federal return for tax year 2017. On adjusted gross income of $50,931 for \ntax year 2017, they overpaid their federal income taxes by $1,695. Their refund was issued \nto them on June 27, 2018. As with previous tax years, no state income tax had been \nwithheld from Applicant\u2019s pay. As a result, they underpaid their non-resident state income \ntaxes by $1,119. With a $45 underpayment penalty, they owed the state $1,197. (AE H.) \nThey mailed their state income tax return for tax year 2017 sometime during the week of \nSeptember 9, 2018. (Tr. 98.) \n \nAlso on June 13, 2018, the tax agent finished Applicant and his spouse\u2019s joint \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax year 2014. Based on the returns, Applicant and \nhis spouse underpaid their federal income taxes by $156 and their state income taxes by \n$135 ($201 with penalties) for tax year 2014. The tax returns could not be submitted \nelectronically, so the tax agent gave them to Applicant\u2019s spouse to mail. As of September \n10, 2018, the IRS had no record of Applicant and his spouse filing an income tax return for \ntax year 2014. (AE E.) Applicant\u2019s spouse did not file the returns until the week of \nSeptember 9, 2018, because she waited to see whether the IRS and state tax authority \nwould take part of their refunds for previous years and apply them to their tax liabilities. \nApplicant and his spouse paid the taxes owed for tax year 2014 when she mailed the \nreturns the week before his security clearance hearing. (Tr. 89-90.) Applicant and his \nspouse have not yet been billed for any delinquent state taxes, so they have not satisfied \ntheir state tax liabilities for 2015 through 2017, which totaled $4,931 per their returns. They \nare not sure what they owe. (Tr. 94.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse attributes her delay in addressing their tax filings to her parents\u2019 \nand her own medical issues, including since April 2017. Her father had an operation in \nOctober 2017, and he died in early September 2018. (Tr. 66, 86. 90.) She assumed that \nthey did not owe taxes because they \u201chad paid the taxes as [they] went along for the most \npart and it was just the reconciliation part that [she] didn\u2019t have time to deal with because of \nall the medical.\u201d (Tr. 102.) Applicant has recently taken on repayment responsibility for \nsome of the household expenses. (Tr. 91.) They intend to retain the services of the tax \nagent to prepare their future income tax returns. (Tr. 87, 93, 95, 99.) \n \nAs of April 2018, Applicant had some outstanding medical collection debt on his \ncredit record: $85 from May 2015; $1,211 (disputed) from November 2012; $66 from \nSeptember 2015; and $321 from May 2017. They were making timely payments of $1,256 \nper month on their mortgage loan obtained in May 2003. As of April 2018, the loan balance \nwas $93,538. Applicant was paying $262 per month on a credit card with a current balance \nof $12,818. He had been late 30 days in August 2017 on a car lease payment of $186 per \nmonth, but had been current since then. (AE I.)  \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant received several awards from a previous employer for his dedication and \nvaluable contributions in support of the military installation. (AE A.) In October 2012, he \nreceived a letter of appreciation from his military customer for his expertise on high-priority \nprojects. (AE B.) Applicant completed voluntary training over the years to ensure that he \ncontinues to perform his duties in information systems security with professionalism and \nhigh quality. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant has the strong endorsement of present and former co-workers, who \nconsider him to be a network administrator of the highest quality. Applicant is relied on for \nhis knowledge and research. He has worked on \u201ccountless tasks and projects with \nsensitive and secret information\u201d and respected privacy and security requirements. \nApplicant is known for giving security issues priority and resolving them in a timely manner. \n(AE B.) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n7 \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through \n2016 and his state income tax returns for tax years 2012, and 2014 through 2016. He and \nhis spouse were entitled to federal tax refunds every year except for tax year 2014, for \nwhich they owed $156. According to their returns submitted within the week preceding his \nsecurity-clearance hearing, they owed state income taxes of approximately $201 for 2014, \n$1,987 for 2015, and $1,747 for 2016. They filed their returns for tax year 2017 on time, \nbut they have yet to pay $1,197 in state taxes. Applicant did not have state taxes withheld \n\n8 \n \nfrom his pay for tax years 2014 through 2017. Guideline F security concerns are \nestablished when an individual fails to comply with his tax filing obligations whether or not \nany taxes are owed. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required,\u201d applies. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. Applicant \ndelegated the filing of their joint income tax returns to his spouse, but he was still \nresponsible for ensuring compliance with such an important obligation as filing returns on \ntime and paying any taxes owed. Regarding possible mitigation under the AGs, one or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file timely federal and state income tax returns for five \nconsecutive tax years, from 2012 through 2016, is too recurrent and recent for mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). Moreover, even though the delinquent tax returns have all been filed \nwith the submission of his and his spouse\u2019s joint federal tax return for tax year 2014 and \nstate tax returns for 2014 through 2016 during the week of September 9, 2018, their state \ntax situation has not been fully resolved. Assuming that they paid the taxes owed for 2014 \n\n9 \n \nas Applicant\u2019s spouse testified, they have made no payments toward $4,931 in state taxes \nowed for 2015 through 2017. \n \nApplicant has a case for partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). He had serious medical \nissues when his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013, and his state \nincome tax return for 2012 were due. He was well enough to resume working in June 2014, \nhowever, and can reasonably be expected to comply with his tax filing obligations starting \nwith tax year 2014. Given his spouse\u2019s self-employment as a realtor, Applicant is not \nfaulted for delegating tax compliance to his spouse. Yet, Applicant exhibited poor judgment \nin failing to take some steps to ensure that their tax returns for tax years 2014 through \n2016 were filed, especially knowing that his spouse was becoming overwhelmed with \ncaregiver duties for her parents and that his unfiled tax returns were of concern to the \nDOD. Applicant took such a hands-off approach to his taxes that he failed to note that state \ntaxes were not being withheld from his pay for several years. Health issues for his spouse \nand her parents continued to take his spouse\u2019s attention, but Applicant has not provided a \ncredible explanation for his failure to take control over their tax situation. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nrequires that an individual act responsibly, and some concern arises in that regard because \nof Applicant\u2019s lack of oversight over his spouse\u2019s handling of their tax issues. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) have some applicability in that their delinquent tax \nreturns have now all been filed. Applicant and his spouse expressed a credible intention to \nutilize the services of their tax agent to file their tax returns in the future. Even so, it is \ndifficult to fully mitigate the security concerns, given the delay in filing some of their income \ntax returns. They had to mail their state tax returns, which were completed in June 2018 by \nthe tax agent. His spouse held their state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through \n2016 and their federal income tax return for 2014 until September 2018, the week before \nApplicant\u2019s security-clearance hearing. She explained that she wanted to see whether any \nof their federal refunds would be applied toward their tax liabilities. However, available IRS \ntranscripts show that their federal income tax refunds for tax years 2015 and 2016 were \nissued to them on July 9, 2018. Their federal income tax refund for tax year 2017 was \nissued to them on June 27, 2018. Available information does not indicate that there were \nrefunds held by the IRS to apply toward their state income tax liabilities. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies \nonly in that the tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 were filed in August 2015, more \nthan two years before the SOR was issued in December 2017, even though they were filed \nlate. \n \n \nEven where tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to \nprevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal \nBoard has long held that the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying \nwith well-established government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016.) Moreover, the Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that the timing of \ncorrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax \n\n10 \n \nissues by DOHA judges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who \nonly begin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that \ntheir clearance might be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when \ntheir immediate interests are not imperiled. In May 2017 and again in September 2017, \nApplicant was reminded that his tax matters were of concern for his clearance. There is no \nevidence that he and his spouse took any steps to resolve the concerns until February \n2018, when they retained the services of the tax agent. Circumstances suggest that had \nthe SOR not been issued, the tax returns would still be unfiled. Concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial judgment also persist because of his unexplained delay in addressing the tax \nwithholding issue to ensure that state taxes are withheld from his pay. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant\u2019s dedication to his work \nwith a defense contractor is unassailable, and there is no indication that he has exercised \npoor judgment on the job. Applicant and his spouse have had to deal with several serious \nmedical issues for themselves and family members that were clearly not foreseen. \nHowever, Applicant has also been able to work full-time for over four years now, and he \ncould reasonably have taken some steps before February 2018 to ensure that his tax \nissues were being addressed in a timely fashion with or without professional assistance. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an applicant \nmishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking security \nclearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing \nAdams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Under Appeal Board precedent, an applicant who \nwaits to address tax issues until his or her immediate interests are at stake does not show \nsound judgment and reliability. His eleventh-hour rectification of his tax filings is too recent \nto create a track record of reasonable assurances that he can be counted on to comply \nwith tax filing deadlines in the future. His failure to give priority to such an important \nobligation as filing tax returns required by law causes lingering doubt about his security \nworthiness that has not been fully mitigated. \n\n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains one allegation that Applicant did not file his Federal and state tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2012. Applicant admitted that he failed to file the returns and explained that when employed by a fast food restaurant in 2009, his employer inserted an incorrect social security number (SSN) for Applicant on his W-2 form and their personnel employment system records. Applicant is 27 years old and single. He has a four-year-old daughter. He and the daughter\u2019s mother (former girlfriend) each have 50% custodial rights of the child. He has been working as a helpdesk administrator since April 2017. Before his current job, he was employed for about 18 months as a field technician for a public school system. After graduating from high school, Applicant received three computer certifications between 2011 and 2013. Those certifications were in computer knowledge, networking and security.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________ \nDecision  \n______________ \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has provided sufficient mitigating evidence to overcome his failure to \nfile his Federal and state tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2012. Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 15, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) for security clearance eligibility so that he could work \nfor a defense contractor. On July 31, 2017, he provided interrogatory answers and \nattached information. In the exhibit, Applicant provided explanations for his Federal tax \nproblems, and also provided Federal tax return and account transcripts for several tax \nyears. On December 21, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the \nnecessary affirmative finding to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him detailing security reasons under the financial \nconsiderations guideline (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \n02/26/2019\n\n \n  2 \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.   \n  \nApplicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on January 17, 2018. The \ncase was assigned to me July 20, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on September 6, 2018, scheduling the hearing on \nSeptember 13, 2018. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s two \nexhibits (GE) 1 and 3 were admitted in evidence. Applicant offered no exhibits to be \nadmitted into evidence. The record remained open until September 28, 2018, to allow \nApplicant the opportunity to submit post-hearing exhibits. He was granted two \nextensions to submit post-hearing exhibits. No exhibits were received by November 7, \n2018, the final deadline for submitting additional evidence. The exchange of post-\nhearing emails between the parties have been marked and entered into evidence as \nApplicant\u2019s exhibit (AE) A. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 24, 2018. \nThe record in this case closed on November 7, 2018.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \n \nAt the beginning of the hearing, I asked Applicant why he did not bring the \nGovernment\u2019s correspondence to the hearing. Applicant\u2019s answer was that he was not \ncertain what documents he was supposed to bring to the hearing. (Tr. 6) To determine \nwhether Applicant had received copies of the proposed Government exhibits in advance \nof the hearing, Department Counsel asked him whether he recognized the proposed \nGovernment exhibits. He recognized GE 1 (December 2015 e-QIP) and GE 3 (July \n2017 answers to interrogatories). Because Applicant did not recall receiving GE 2, his \nFebruary 2016 personal subject interview (PSI), Department Counsel moved to \nwithdraw the exhibit. The motion was granted. (Tr. 18-19)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \nThe SOR contains one allegation that Applicant did not file his Federal and state \ntax returns for tax years 2009 through 2012. Applicant admitted that he failed to file the \nreturns and explained that when employed by a fast food restaurant in 2009, his \nemployer inserted an incorrect social security number (SSN) for Applicant on his W-2 \nform and their personnel employment system records.  \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and single. He has a four-year-old daughter. He and the \ndaughter\u2019s mother (former girlfriend) each have 50% custodial rights of the child. He has \nbeen working as a helpdesk administrator since April 2017. Before his current job, he \nwas employed for about 18 months as a field technician for a public school system. \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant received three computer certifications \nbetween 2011 and 2013. Those certifications were in computer knowledge, networking \nand security. This security clearance application is Applicant\u2019s second. In 2012, he was \n\n \n  3 \n \nsponsored for a security clearance, but his interim clearance was denied for unknown \nreasons. (GE 1 at 11-30, 46; Tr. 6-13, 33) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems started in tax year 2009, when his first employer, a fast \nfood operation, entered an incorrect SSN on his W-2 form, a document that an employer \nmust send to an employee and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at the end of the tax \nyear. Two days before Applicant (19 years old at the time) was required to file the 2009 \nFederal tax return (April 2010), he discovered the W-2 form had the wrong SSN. He \nfiled for an extension, but did not file a return for 2009. He tried unsuccessfully to \ncontact his employer\u2019s corporate offices. Then, Applicant informed his general manager \nwho responded that the SSN would be corrected. (GE 1 at 25-30; Tr. 22-24) \n \n \nLater in 2010, Applicant received another W-2 form with a corrected SSN. He \nspoke with a family friend who told him that he could not file for the current tax year \nunless he had filed for the previous tax year. Nonetheless, he filed for an extension for \n2010 (April 2011) as he had done for 2009. However, he did not file the 2010, 2011, or \n2012 Federal and state tax returns because he was still guided by the notion that he \ncould not file for current tax years unless he had filed for previous tax years. He \nremembered saving the W-2 forms for 2009 through 2012 tax years and intended to file \nthe Federal tax returns. Even though he had the corrected W-2 forms, he could not \nfurnish a reason for not filing the federal tax returns. He eventually lost the 2009 through \n2012 W-2 forms. Applicant claimed that after he was told in 2013 he could file for \ncurrent tax years even though he had not filed for previous years, he filed his Federal \nand state tax returns for all subsequent years. Applicant submitted proof that he filed \nFederal returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. There is no evidence that \nApplicant owes any Federal or state taxes for any tax year. (Answer to SOR; GE 3 at \n18-26; Tr. 24-29) \n \n \nIn an effort to recover his W-2 forms for the missing Federal tax years, Applicant \ntried to contact his previous employers, but received little cooperation from them, and in \nsome instances his phone calls were never returned. He claimed that he contacted the \nIRS, but had no success. He entered the IRS website and obtained the tax transcripts \n(GE 3), but only for the years he filed returns. He has been unable to speak with an IRS \nrepresentative because of his work hours. (Tr.29-31) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing documentation consists of emails explaining his efforts \nto obtain the necessary Federal and state tax documentation. On September 17, 2018, \nfour days after the hearing (September 13, 2018), Applicant reported that he obtained \nthe state tax returns from 2013 to the present and would be submitting them at a later \ntime. Regarding the missing W-2 forms, a tax preparer service informed him that he \nwould have to fill out an application with the IRS. Then, it would take up to 10 days for \nthe IRS to send him the IRS income tax reports. Applicant did not believe he would be \nable to retrieve the pertinent documents by the September 28, 2018 deadline for \nsubmitting post-hearing documents. (AE A at 1) \n\n \n  4 \n \n \nOn September 18, 2018, Applicant indicated that that he had applied for a \npersonal identification number (PIN) with the IRS. He estimated that it would take up to \ntwo weeks from September 18, 2018 (beyond the post-hearing deadline) to receive the \nPIN and consult with the tax preparer service to process the return. He inquired whether \nhe should copy and submit the complete state tax returns or just the first page of the \nreturn showing the stamp of the state tax agency. On September 25, 2018, Department \nCounsel indicated no objection to an extension of the September 28, 2018 deadline for \nsubmission of post-hearing documents. On September 26, 2018, I granted an extension \nof the deadline to October 17, 2018. (AE A) \n \n \nOn October 16, 2018, Applicant provided an update of the difficulties confronted \nin obtaining his W-2 forms so that he could file his tax returns. First, he was unable to \nget the W-2 forms from most of his previous employers. He obtained the income reports \nfrom the IRS, but they do not contain earned income numbers (EIN) for previous \nemployers and state tax withholding information. One state tax agency in which he was \npreviously employed advised him that they do not retain state tax withholding \ninformation. The agency informed him that he would have to submit an application with \nthe Social Security Administration (SSA) to receive the missing W-2 forms. According to \nthe form, it would take up to six weeks to receive copies of the W-2 forms. Then, he \nwould provide W-2 forms and income reports to his tax preparation service for \nprocessing. Applicant requested another extension of deadline. On October 17, 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s request for an extension was granted until November 7, 2018. No \ndocumentation was presented. (AE A)  \n \nPolicies  \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d   \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \n \n \n\n \n  5 \n \n \nAnalysis  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying condition relevant in this case is:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nWhen he was 19 years old (2009), Applicant was working at a fast food \nrestaurant. Through no fault of his own, his employer entered an incorrect SSN for \nApplicant on his W-2 form and its personnel employment records system. He did not \ndiscover the SSN error until two days before the 2010 deadline for filing his 2009 federal \ntax return. He received an extension to file his 2009 tax return, but did not file the return. \nHe received a new W-2 form with a corrected SSN before the deadline for filing his \n2010 tax return. However, he believed he could not file for the current tax year unless \nhe filed for the previous tax year. Though he received an extension to file his 2010 \nFederal tax return, he did not file the return. He did not file his federal tax returns for \n2011 and 2012, even though he had corrected W-2 forms for 2009 through 2012. \nFailure to file his Federal and state tax returns suggests that Applicant may not have the \njudgment necessary for complying with well-established government rules that are \nessential for safeguarding classified information. AG \u00b6 19(f) apples.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  \n \n\n \n  6 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nI find the foregoing mitigating conditions apply. When Applicant received the \ncorrected W-2 forms in 2011, he exercised poor judgment in not immediately filing his \nFederal and state tax returns. However, after conversing with a tax filer in 2013 who \ninformed him that he could file returns for the current tax year even though he did not \nfile for previous years, he filed his 2013 Federal tax return, and has continued to file all \nFederal and state tax returns since. Initiating his legal obligation to file his tax returns in \n2014 (2013 tax year) demonstrates that his failure to file the tax returns between 2009 \nthrough 2012 is unlikely to recur, and no longer raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies.  \n \n \nWhile there is no evidence that Applicant received counseling on tax issues until \nSeptember 2018, he received informal advice in 2011 from a family friend and in 2013 \nfrom another tax filer. The information he received in 2011 was untrue. On the other \nhand, he received truthful advice two years later persuading him to exercise good \njudgment in filing his 2013 tax return, even though he had not filed returns for previous \nyears. In his detailed post-hearing emails, he has received ongoing guidance from the \ntax preparation service and the Federal and state tax agencies on acquiring his W-2 \nforms, IRS income reports, and state tax withholding information. Based on the steps \nApplicant has taken thus far to file the missing Federal and state tax returns, I am \nconfident he will obtain the missing tax information that will enable him to file his Federal \nand state tax returns in a reasonable period time. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply because Applicant\u2019s earnings during the period were probably insufficient to \nrequire him to file tax returns. \n \n Whole-Person Concept  \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n  7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nAccording to his December 2015 e-QIP, Applicant began his employment career \nin 2009 as a fast food worker. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, he earned three computer \ncertificates in knowledge, networking, and security. In October 2015, he put his \ncomputer knowledge to use as a field technician repairing a public school\u2019s system \ncomputers. In April 2017, he continued to apply his computer knowledge as a help desk \nadministrator for a computer contractor. In his December 2015 e-QIP, his July 2017 \nanswers to interrogatories, his January 2018 answer to the SOR, and at the hearing, \nApplicant provided a consistently credible explanation of how he encountered tax \nissues.  \n \n \nIn his post-hearing emails in September and October 2018, Applicant provided \ninformation in persuasive detail of his ongoing efforts to acquire the missing W-2 forms \nso that he can file the 2009 through 2012 Federal and state tax returns. Though \nprocrastination was a major reason why he did not file the missing tax returns in the \npast, he was much younger when he was working in his first job at the fast food \nrestaurant in 2009. In addition to not being sufficiently knowledgeable about tax issues, \nApplicant was not prepared for his employer entering the wrong SSN on his W-2 form. \nAfter receiving correct information in 2013 that he could file returns for the current tax \nyear even though he had not filed returns for previous tax years, Applicant has filed tax \nreturns for all subsequent years. Having considered the entire record from an overall \ncommon-sense point of view, Applicant\u2019s irresponsibility in not filing his Federal and \nstate tax returns for four years from 2009 through 2012 is mitigated by the corrective \naction he is taking to file the missing returns. His conduct convinces me that he will \nconsistently file all tax returns in the future.  \n \nFormal Findings  \n  \n Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n\n \n  8 \n \n  \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n  \n  \nFOR APPLICANT  \n  \n  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion  \n  \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n____________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 8, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 13, 2018, and requested his case be \ndecided on the record. He later withdrew this request and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 6, 2018. This hearing \nwas originally scheduled for March 13, 2019. Applicant requested a continuance, which \n\n \n2 \n \n \nwas granted. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 8, 2019. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits 1 through 131. \nThere were no objections and all exhibits were admitted into evidence. On April 9, 2018, \nI proposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not object. The transcript was received on April \n18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He and his wife were \nseparated in 2015 and went through an acrimonious divorce, which was completed in \nSeptember 2017. In 2016, when he began the security clearance process, he learned \nthat his wife had failed to file their federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012-\n2015. It had been agreed by them that during their marriage she would handle the family \nfinances. His wife remained in the marital home, but refused to pay the mortgage or \nvacate it so it could be sold and resolve some financial issues. Applicant did not want the \nhouse to be foreclosed. He took legal action to stay the foreclosure, which was granted. \nHis wife left the premises. Applicant fixed the house for sale and retained a buyer, but his \nwife refused to appear to close on the house. Applicant took legal action through an \nemergency motion to appoint a trustee to stand in her place so Applicant could close on \nthe house. This forced his wife to appear and close on the house. Included in the closing \nwere payoffs to different entities, including Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s student loan, for which he \nwas a co-signor. There had been a judgment against both Applicant and his wife for the \nloan. In accordance with Applicant\u2019s divorce decree his wife is responsible for this debt \nand agreed to indemnify him. \n \nRegarding the federal tax returns. Applicant filed and paid all delinquent federal \nincome taxes. When he learned of the delinquent federal tax returns, he also discovered \nthat his Human Resource Department, where he was formerly employed, had withheld \nstate payroll taxes for the incorrect state. Applicant lived in State A and worked in State \nB. His tax preparer had also mistakenly prepared his past state tax returns for State B. \nApplicant has filed his past-due state tax returns for State A and paid the delinquent taxes. \nHe attempted to recoup the taxes he paid to State B, but was advised he could only \nrecoup the taxes for the past three years; so he was only eligible to recoup it for one year. \nApplicant provided supporting documents to show all of his federal and state income tax \nreturns are filed and the taxes paid. \n \nApplicant also provided documentation to show the past-due mortgage debt was \nresolved through the sale of the property, as were other debts. He provided \ndocumentation that all of the remaining debts are resolved. He credibly testified that one \nsmall debt was paid in 2016, and he requested the creditor provide him a receipt. He was \nwaiting for the receipt to corroborate his statement. He credibly testified that some of the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsmaller debts\u2019 invoices were mailed to the marital home when he was not living there, \nand he was unaware of them.  \n \n \nApplicant provided a detailed budget to show he has a significant surplus after he \npays all of his monthly expenses. He was recently awarded custody of his eight-year-old \nson. He does not have any outstanding debts. He does not have any credit cards. He \ncurrently maintains sole responsibility for his finances.  \n \nI find that \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) were raised by the evidence. I find that AG \u00b6 20(a) is \napplicable because it happened under unique circumstances that are unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. It is \nnot unusual for one spouse to rely on the other to handle the finances. Applicant trusted \nhis partner to file and pay their taxes and debts. I find that although these circumstances \nwere not totally beyond Applicant\u2019s control, when he learned of them, he acted \nresponsibly to resolve all of his financial delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant sought assistance through his attorney and accountant to resolve all of \nhis financial problems. He paid all of the delinquent debts and taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), \nand 20(g) apply. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s finances do not create doubt about his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In \nreaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the \nfavorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also gave due consideration \nto the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. This case is decided for Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On \nDecember 8, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations.1 \n1 DOD CAF took this action under Executive Order (Exec.

She admitted SOR \u00b6 1.u during her hearing \ntestimony. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. She was married from 1997 to 2011. She has two \nchildren: a daughter, age 19, and a son, age 17. Both children live at home with her. \nHer daughter attends junior college and her son is a high school senior. Applicant \nremarried in May 2015 and divorced a year later, in February 2017. (Tr. 29-31; 91; AE \nD; GE 1) \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from 1997 to 1999. She was discharged \nhonorably after she became pregnant with her first child. (Tr. 36; GE 1) She has earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree, and has had subsequent schooling. (Tr. 35-36)  \n                                                          \n2 AE A through AE C were attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer.  \n \n3 Tr. 47, 101-103. The motion was granted without objection. During the hearing, I erroneously referenced \nthe new allegation as \u201cSOR \u00b6 1.m,\u201d instead of by what came next in the sequence (SOR \u00b6 1.u) as it is \nidentified here.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has held a security clearance since 2004. She worked for defense \ncontractor B from 2004 until November 2012. She then took a new contractor position, \nwhere she worked until she was furloughed, in July 2013. Over the next five years, she \nwas employed from September 2013 to January 2014; laid off and unemployed until \nMarch 2014; employed again until November 2016; and laid off and unemployed until \nJanuary 2017. Since then, she has been employed as a software developer for her \ncurrent employer and clearance sponsor. She earns $100,000 annually. (Tr. 36-41, 94-\n95; GE 1; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant enrolled her children into private school from about 2011 to 2013, \nbecause they were being bullied in public school. (Tr. 92-94; AE D) In 2012, after \nleaving her job with defense contractor B, Applicant cashed out her 401(k), taking out \nabout $25,000. She used the 401(k) money to finance her children\u2019s tuition and to pay \noff several consumer debts. (Tr. 44-45) After 2013, Applicant returned her children to \npublic school after she moved. She also was not able to afford private tuition. (Tr. 93) \n \nApplicant was not aware that an early withdrawal from her 401(k) caused tax \nconsequences, so she did not pay taxes on that income at the time. SOR \u00b6 1.a is a \nstate tax lien issued in 2016 for $5,904. When Applicant learned of the tax debt, she \ncontacted tax authorities and attempted to repay it, but she stopped making payments \nafter she was laid off in late 2016. (Tr. 34, 43-45, 52) She did not make further \nrepayment efforts until after the SOR. (Tr. 34, 52-53) \n \nAE F reflects payment plans for two state tax debts. One is for Applicant and her \nformer spouse, though Applicant is responsible for it. Applicant is to pay about $67 a \nmonth for 12 months (on one $765 state tax debt). Under the second plan, Applicant is \nto pay $184 a month for 36 months (on another state tax debt, of about $6,000). The \nrepayment agreements are in place as of August 15, 2018, but no evidence of \npayments was submitted. (Tr. 53-55; AE F) \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant also learned that she owed federal taxes as a result of her \nearly 401(k) withdrawal. She testified that she owed about $12,000 in federal income \ntaxes. She said the IRS has kept about $6,000 of her federal refunds to resolve this \ndebt. She has about $6,000 left to pay. (Tr. 44, 47-49) (SOR \u00b6 1.u) Applicant did not \nprovide any documentation to corroborate her testimony. She has not taken any other \nsteps to repay her federal tax debt. \n \nApplicant asserted that the credit reports (GE 2, GE 3) contain incorrect \ninformation and that many of her debts are resolved, either because they are now in \ngood standing, or because they no longer appear on her credit reports. (AE D) She said \nshe contacted the credit bureaus to address the errors and dispute them. (Tr. 13, 32, \n107) She provided more recent credit reports which do not show all of the debts alleged. \n(AE A; AE G) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a 2012 judgment against Applicant in favor of creditor M, a \ncollection agency, for $1,577. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 3) Applicant asserted that the debt is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe same as SOR \u00b6 1.s ($1,897), a past-due credit card account issued by Bank C and \nreported to collection agency M. (GE 3 at 12) Applicant denied both debts because they \nare no longer listed on her credit reports. (AE A; AE G) She also said she never had a \ncredit card with Bank C. (Tr. 55-62)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($21,261), 1.d ($9,112), 1.e ($9,915), 1.l ($19,398), 1.m ($12,931), \n1.n ($9,372), and 1.o ($2,835) are past-due private student loan debts. As alleged, they \ntotal about $85,000. However, they are based on two separate credit reports, and some \nare duplicates. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are the same debt. They are to the same creditor, \nwere both opened in October 2011, and have almost identical account numbers. (GE 2 \nat 4) SOR \u00b6 1.l (listed on GE 3 at 3) is also a duplicate of debt \u00b6 1.c. \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were deferred for several years. They became \ndelinquent during her divorce (2011-2012), though she only learned this later. (Tr. 33, \n63) She consolidated most of her student loans in 2015. (AE C; AE E) She documented \nthat four of her loans (totaling about $34,600) were consolidated and \u201cpaid in full\u201d by the \nU. S. Department of Education in 2015. (AE E) Applicant acknowledged that she still \nhas to repay the loans, but now owes the federal government instead of private lenders. \nApplicant believes she owes between $40,000 and $60,000 overall. (Tr. 63-72) \n \n \n \nAll but one of Applicant\u2019s student loans are again in deferment. She neglected to \ninclude one of her private loans (it is not clear which one) in consolidation. She intends \nto keep her student loans in deferment while her children are in school. She hopes to \nbegin repayment in 2019 or 2020. (Tr. 69-74) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($3,242) is a charged-off debt relating to an old computer purchase. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q ($1,714) is the same debt. The account numbers are the same, the creditors \nhave the same initials and the two accounts are listed on separate credit reports. (GE 2 \nat 4; GE 3 at 5) Applicant acknowledged that one of the debts is valid. She contacted \nthe creditor to try to settle the debt, and intends to pay it. (Tr. 75-77) SOR \u00b6 1.q is a \nduplicate, but SOR \u00b6 1.f remains unresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($68) is a charged-off debt to a credit union at a military base where \nApplicant used to work, from 2009 to 2013. It remains listed on her credit reports and is \nunpaid. (GE 2 at 4; AE A at 34; AE G at 1-2). Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 76-78) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($1,059) and 1.t ($1,081) are the same debt. The bank, the collection \nagency, and the account numbers are the same. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 78-82). SOR \u00b6 1.t is a \nduplicate, but SOR \u00b6 1.h remains unresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,029) is a debt placed in collection by a bank. It became delinquent \nin about 2010. Applicant believes it has been paid. Applicant recently disputed the debt \nwith credit bureaus. (Tr. 79-83; GE 2 at 11) She provided no corroborating \ndocumentation. The account remains unresolved.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($695) is an old, past-due utility bill, incurred when Applicant lived in \nanother state during her first marriage. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant disputed it with the \ncreditor, and asserts that it was removed from her credit report. (Tr. 82-87) She \nprovided no corroborating documentation. The account remains unresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($185) is a past-due debt to a cable company. (GE 2 at 11) Applicant \nsaid it is an old bill and that it has been paid. She said she contacted the cable company \nfor verification. (Tr. 85-87) She provided no corroborating documentation. The account \nremains unresolved.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p ($1,824) is a past-due debt owed to a department store. Applicant \ndenied the debt, which has been pending since 2010. She intends to pay it, but it \nremains unresolved. (Tr. 88; GE 3 at 5)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r ($1,509) is a past-due credit card account issued by a large hardware \nstore. (GE 3 at 5). It has been pending since 2010. Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 89) \n \nApplicant declared several delinquent debts on her SCA, in 2015, noting that \nmany were due to her first divorce. She did little to try to resolve them until she received \nthe SOR. This was due, in part, to her somewhat sporadic employment situation, but \nshe also acknowledged that she did not pay attention to her finances. (Tr. 95-98; GE 1; \nAE D) Currently, Applicant is living paycheck-to-paycheck. She has little money saved. \nShe pays $1,575 in rent. She bought a used car in 2017. She pays for some of her \ndaughter\u2019s college expenses. (Tr. 49-52) \n \nApplicant began a credit counseling program two months before the hearing. She \nlearned about a well-known credit counselor\u2019s \u201csnowball\u201d method of repayment (paying \nthe smallest debt first, then the next smallest, and so on). She intends to address her \ndebts one by one in this way, while also paying her tax debts, and then addressing her \nstudent loans at a later date. She also has learned how to keep a monthly budget. (Tr. \n88-90, 95-96, 108)  \n \n \nA co-worker and supervisor who hired Applicant for her current job attests that \nApplicant is a knowledgeable professional. She is also honest, trustworthy, hard-\nwording, and loyal. She maintains confidentiality and has been entrusted to maintain \naccess to sensitive information without issues. (AE H) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d4 \n \n                                                          \n4 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n7 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  \n \nApplicant incurred numerous delinquent debts, including state and federal \nincome taxes, student loans, and other debts, as established by the credit reports in \nevidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(f) also applies to Applicant\u2019s tax debt. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.l, 1.q, and 1.t are duplicates of other debts in the record. They are not \nestablished.5 Applicant did not establish that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.s are the same debt. \n \nApplicant was unwilling to pay many of her old debts because they were no \nlonger listed on her credit reports. The mere fact that a debt is no longer listed on a \nrecent credit does not establish that it is resolved, is no longer valid, or that Applicant is \nno longer responsible for it.6  AG \u00b6 19(b) is also established.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n                                                          \n5 When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005) (same debt alleged twice). \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 14-003612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25. 2015) \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are due, in part, to conditions beyond her control, including her \nfirst divorce and occasional periods of unemployment in the last five years. The first \nprong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. However, for full credit, Applicant must show \nreasonable action under the circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has significant unpaid student loans. She consolidated most of them \nseveral years ago, and they are no longer delinquent, since they are again deferred. \nHowever, their deferred status does not bar me from considering that Applicant has \nmade no real effort to pay them over the years, and has no specific repayment plan in \nplace now. I cannot consider them resolved.  \n \nApplicant began to address her debts only when she received the SOR. The \nDOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the timing of an applicant\u2019s efforts to \nresolve debts is a relevant consideration. An applicant who resolves financial problems \nonly when her clearance might be imperiled raises questions about her willingness to \nfollow the rules governing classified information when her personal interests are not at \nstake.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent income was impacted by her somewhat sporadic employment. \nHowever, she now earns a $100,000 annual salary. She has not shown that even the \nsmallest of her debts have been paid. Her plan is to pay her smallest debts first, along \nwith her taxes, and then to address her student loans. This is a reasonable plan. \nHowever, she has not taken sufficient steps towards implementing that plan to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) or AG \u00b6 20(d). Similarly, Applicant has only recently \nparticipated in credit counseling, and she has not shown that her debts are in control or \nare being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not fully apply. \n \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case No. 16-03187at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018); ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, \n2015) \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s reliance on the fact that several of her debts are no longer listed on \nher credit reports is not sufficient to establish that they are no longer valid, have been \nresolved, or that she has a basis to dispute them. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Even \nthough many of Applicant\u2019s debts are old, they are also ongoing. She did not establish \nthat her debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. They continue to \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply.  \n \nApplicant incurred unforeseen tax debt after she made early withdrawals from \nher 401(k) to make ends meet during employment instability and to finance her \nchildren\u2019s private school education for about two years, which she felt necessary for \ntheir well-being. She has a payment plan for her state tax debt, SOR \u00b6 1.a, but did not \ndocument any payments towards it. She provided no documents to corroborate her \ntestimony that SOR \u00b6 1 u, her federal tax debt, is being resolved. She also has no \npayment plan in place to resolve that debt by means other than the IRS\u2019s recapturing \nher tax refunds. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts occurred, in part, due to conditions beyond her control. \nHowever, she only began to address her debts recently, and has not established a \nsufficient track record of steady payments, reasonable action, or financial stability to \nwarrant a finding that the security concern over her debts is mitigated. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:   \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:   \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for continued access to classified information is denied.                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 16, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 31, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 14, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nDecember 13, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 24, 2019. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and table of \nfinancial allegations, as well as a Request for Administrative Notice for the Federal \nRepublic of Iraq, were appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III, \nrespectively. I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through G, which \nI admitted in evidence without objection. The record was held open pending additional \ndocuments to be submitted by Applicant by February 25, 2019. Those additional \ndocuments were submitted within the appropriate time, marked as a group, as AE H, and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 5, \n2019. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Federal Republic of Iraq was included in the record as HE III. Applicant did not \nobject. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in HE III, summarized \nbelow. \n \nThe U.S. Director of National Intelligence stated in 2018, that Iraq is likely to face \na lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict as it struggles to rebuild, reconstitute the \nIraqi state, maintain pressure on ISIS, and rein in the Iranian-backed Shia militias that \npose an enduring threat to U.S. personnel. ISIS will remain a terrorist and insurgent threat, \nand the group will seek to exploit Sunni discontent to conduct attacks and try to regain \nIraqi territory. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department stated in its 2017 annual human rights report, that \nviolence continued throughout Iraq, largely fueled by the actions of ISIS. The most \nsignificant human rights issues included allegations of unlawful killings by some members \nof the Iraqi Security Forces; disappearance and extortion by elements of the Popular \nMobilization Forces; torture; harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison \nfacilities; arbitrary arrest and detention; arbitrary interference with privacy; criminalization \nof libel and other limits on freedom of expression; violence against journalists; widespread \nofficial corruption; greatly reduced penalties for so-called \u201chonor killings\u201d; coerced or \nforced abortions imposed by ISIS on its victims; legal restrictions on freedom of \nmovement of women; and trafficking in persons.  \n \nForeigners, Iraqi citizens, and especially dual U.S.-Iraqi citizens are targets of \nkidnapping for money and political/religious reasons. Many hostages have been killed. In \n2017, the U.S. Secretary of State said that ISIS is responsible for genocide against \nYezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims in areas it controls or has controlled. ISIS is also \nresponsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing directed at these same \ngroups, and in some cases against Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and other minorities. \n  \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The ability of the \n\n \n3 \n \nU.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is extremely \nlimited given the security environment. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) controls \na significant portion of Iraq\u2019s territory and is conducting a widespread, active insurgency \nin many parts of Iraq and Syria. The U.S. Government considers the potential personal \nsecurity threats to U.S. Government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require \nthem to live and work under strict security guidelines. Anti-American and anti-Western \nsentiment exists throughout Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s father, mother, two sisters and a brother are residents \nand citizens of Iraq. It also alleges 11 delinquent debts, totaling $21,100. Applicant \nadmitted the SOR allegations with comments, except he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He was born in Iraq. He is not married and has no \nchildren. He immigrated to the United States in 2009 with a special immigrant visa, and \nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2015. He was granted a U.S. passport and his Iraq \npassport was relinquished. He does not own property or any assets in Iraq, and votes in \nU.S. elections. Applicant has family who are residents and citizens of Iraq, including his \nfather, mother, and two sisters, who live together. His brother lives in France with his \nspouse. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1994 and attended some college in Iraq. \nHe served his required military service in the Iraqi Republican Guard from 1999 to 2002 \nas an enlisted military engineer. Applicant dreamed to be a U.S. citizen, and believes in \nthe cause of freedom, humanitarian relief, and elimination of terrorism in Iraq. He hopes \nto teach the U.S. military about the culture, language, and behavior of Iraqi people. \nApplicant is currently employed as a media analyst, and is sponsored for a security \nclearance by a government contractor who intends to hire him as a linguist. He was \nunemployed from November 2016 to at least March 2017.  \n \nApplicant voluntarily assisted U.S. coalition forces in 2003. He worked officially \nwith the U.S. military as a local-hire linguist/translator from 2003 to 2009. During that time, \nhe was employed by five different U.S. contractors. As religious minorities, he and his \nfamily were threatened by the terrorist group Al-Qaeda in about 2004. Threats included \nleaflets in his neighborhood, a judgment against him for beheading, and a bullet shot \nthrough his car window, without him in it. However, he stated that he has never been \nphysically harmed, but he stayed away from his home for extended periods so as not to \ndraw attention to his family. His brother moved to France because the terrorist group\u2019s \nactivities in Iraq were interfering with his sales business. The threats stopped in 2007 or \n2008. Applicant has not returned to Iraq since 2009.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, 75 years old, is retired from employment with an oil company. \nHis mother, 68 years old, is a homemaker. One sister is unemployed, and the other works \nfor an oil company in Iraq. Applicant maintains regular contact by text and email with his \nsisters, who relay information to his parents because they are not familiar with technology. \nHe does not call home because it is too expensive. \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant fell behind on financial obligations beginning in about 2011, due to a \nfailed relationship and exacerbated by periods of unemployment. He obtained his credit \nreport and undertook an effort to resolve his debts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d and 1.g were \nsmall debts that Applicant disputed or settled, and were removed from his credit report. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.j, 1.k, 1.i, and 1.h have been settled and paid. SOR 1.d is a small \nmedical account that no longer is listed in his credit report. Applicant provided an \nadditional paid receipt for an account that was not listed in the SOR. His current credit \nreport from all three credit reporting services shows no collection accounts. Applicant \nsubmitted documents showing the resolution of his debts. In addition, Applicant pursued \ncredit counseling with a non-profit service, and completed a household budget. His \nbudget shows a positive net cash flow and the beginning of a savings program for \nemergencies. He has not incurred new debts since 2014, does not have a credit card, \nand pays all financial obligations when due. \n \nApplicant provided numerous letters of support from U.S. military officials with \nwhom he has worked, and certificates of appreciation for his work as a linguist. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n \n5 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, \na family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country \nis known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In considering the \nnature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist \nactivity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did not \nconsider terrorist activity in area where family members resided). \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nApplicant maintains text and email communications with his sisters, and through them, \nwith his parents. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nApplicant was born and educated in Iraq, and served his mandatory service in the \nIraqi Army during an enlistment as an engineer from 1999 to 2002. From 2003 to 2009, \nApplicant worked as a linguist for U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq. He moved to the United \nStates in 2009 using a special immigrant visa because of his work on behalf of U.S. forces \nin Iraq, and became a U.S. citizen in 2015. He votes in the United States. Applicant has \nnot returned to Iraq since 2009.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are retired and they did not have ties to the Iraqi \ngovernment. One sister works for an oil company, and the other stays home with her \nparents. Applicant\u2019s brother and his spouse live in France. Applicant has no financial ties \nto Iraq, does not own property, and does not participate in elections. His family members \nare not directly tied to the Iraqi government, nor are they sympathetic to insurgent groups. \nAlthough Applicant maintains text or email communications with his family, he does not \nmake phone calls, and has not returned to Iraq since 2009. Applicant expressed his deep \nloyalty and appreciation for the United States and supports the U.S. and coalition forces \ngoals in Iraq. He has lived and worked in the United States since 2009, has a U.S. bank \naccount, votes in U.S. elections, and helps other immigrants with advise on how to stay \nwithin the U.S. laws. He expressed a kinship with U.S. troops that fought in Iraq and \nwants to train U.S. forces in cultural and language skills.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense \nof the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant \nin a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). Applicant is \nstrongly supported by the U.S. military officials with whom he worked as a linguist in Iraq. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) apply. \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred several delinquent debts beginning in about 2011 due to a failed \nrelationship and periods of unemployment. The record evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20, and I considered all of them. The following are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant resolved his debts through diligent work and tenacious efforts. His credit \nreport shows no collection accounts, and he has taken steps to obtain counseling, not \nuse credit cards, and build a financial budget and savings. I believe Applicant has \novercome his financial problems and additional delinquencies are unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b), (c), and (d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guidelines, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security concerns. \nAccordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.k: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nGregg A.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 25, 2016. \nOn March 22, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nH. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017.\nApplicant answered the SOR on May 10, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase in an undated document, which was sent to Applicant on October 17, 2018, and he \n02/27/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwas given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on October 30, 2018, and \ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included Item 5, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) \nconducted on June 20, 2017. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions \nor updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to \nrespond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, \nthey are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the \nDirective.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations. His admissions in \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old information technology specialist employed by a federal \ncontractor since February 2016. He graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nMay 2011. He was unemployed after graduation until he was hired in March 2012 as an \nadministrative assistant at a small marketing company. He moved to another area in \nSeptember 2012 and worked for six months as an administrative assistant at a small \nsoftware company. He moved again and worked as a day laborer at his father\u2019s roofing \ncompany. He was unemployed from January to April 2013, and then worked as a \nlandscaper from April 2013 to January 2014. He was unemployed from January 2014 \nuntil he was hired by a medical marijuana propagator in January 2015, for whom he \nworked until he was hired for his current job. \n \nApplicant is unmarried, lives with a cohabitant, and has no children. (FORM Item \n5 at 4.) He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant started using marijuana in May 2007 and used it every week or two with \nfriends while he was in college. After he graduated from college, he continued to use \nmarijuana every month or two with friends. He stopped using it in October 2012 because \nit gave him anxiety. He resumed his marijuana use in October 2013, using it every month \nor two with friends. He purchased it from various local drug dealers until January 2013, \nwhen he moved to a state where marijuana was legal and obtained a marijuana card. He \ntold a security investigator that he obtained a prescription for marijuana to relieve \ndepression, and he obtained a marijuana card that allowed him to grow a limited number \nof marijuana plants and to purchase marijuana from a legal marijuana dispensary. He \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 4) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nstopped growing, purchasing, and using it in October 2015. His marijuana card expired in \nOctober 2016. (FORM Item 5 at 6.)  \n \nApplicant told a security investigator that he stopped using marijuana because he \nwas bored with using it, that he no longer associates with marijuana users, and that he \ndoes not intend to grow or use marijuana in the future. He does not consider himself \naddicted to marijuana. (FORM Item 5 at 7.) In his SCA, he stated that he used it \ninfrequently for nine years, \u201caround once every month to two months on average,\u201d but \nthat he would \u201csometimes go a year without using.\u201d (FORM Item 4 at 40.) \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he submitted a statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all illegal drug involvement and substance abuse. He acknowledged that any future \ndrug involvement or substance misuse would constitute grounds for revocation of a \nsecurity clearance. (FORM Item 3.)  \n \nApplicant did not submit any character references or job-performance evaluations. \nAlthough he told a security investigator that he obtained medical marijuana to treat his \ndepression, he provided no evidence indicating whether he continues to suffer from \ndepression and, if so, whether he found a legal substitute to treat it. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nMay 2007 to at least October 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges that he possessed a \nmedical marijuana card from about January 2015 to October 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that \nhe worked for a medical marijuana propagator from about January 2015 to February 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n\n \n5 \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was frequent and did not \noccur under unusual circumstances. The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (Ahappened so long \nago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There are no Abright line@ \nrules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant \nperiod of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative \njudge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances \nor conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s abstinence from marijuana from October 2015 to the present is a \n\u201csignificant period of time,\u201d but it must be considered in the context of eight years of \npurchasing, growing, and using marijuana (May 2007 to October 2015, with one year of \nabstinence), including six years (May 2007 to January 2013) when he illegally purchased \nit from local drug dealers and used it, knowing that it was illegal. He now lives in a state \nwhere it is legal and readily available but still illegal under federal law. Since February \n2016, he has been under pressure to obtain a clearance and keep his job. I am not \nsatisfied that sufficient time has passed to show that he will not revert to his previous drug \ninvolvement when the pressure of qualifying for a clearance and keeping his job is lifted.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is partially established. Applicant has abstained from marijuana for \nmore than three years. He no longer associates with drug users or illegal drug dealers. \nHe has changed his environment from a job selling marijuana to a job for a federal \ncontractor who requires abstinence from illegal drugs. He has signed the requisite \nstatement of intent. However, he still lives and works in a state where marijuana use is \nlegal and it is readily available. He has submitted no \u201cevidence of actions to overcome \nthis problem,\u201d such as treatment or counseling. He told a security investigator that he \nused marijuana to control his depression, but he submitted no evidence regarding his \ncurrent steps to control depression without using marijuana. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has drifted through several jobs since his graduation from \ncollege, and his current job is the first that offers a meaningful career. He submitted no \nevidence about his job performance or other evidence of a pattern of responsible conduct. \nHe does not yet have a track record of jobs demonstrating reliability, trustworthiness, and \nthe ability to follow rules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credibility is a key element in this case, and he bears the burden of \nshowing that he will not return to his drug-using lifestyle. Because he requested a \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \n \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there \nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, \n1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence from using marijuana and his statement of intent to continue his abstinence, \nHowever, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel a favorable \nsecurity clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14684 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014). Based \non the sparse record in this case, I cannot conclude that Applicant has overcome this \npresumption. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse):  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She claimed to have been\nunaware of the SOR debts until she was confronted with them. However, all the SOR\ndebts were in various stages of delinquency before December 2015. Nevertheless, she\nstated her intent to address the listed debts.\nApplicant documented no efforts to address her debts, either after her interview or\nafter she received the SOR. She attributed her financial problems to her unemployment\nperiods and her husband\u2019s retirement. However, she provided no evidence to show how\nthese events changed her financial posture. Moreover, her most recent unemployment\nperiod was barely more than a month long. She provided no budget or financial\nstatement. She has not documented any financial or credit counseling. She provided no\nwork or character references, or any evidence of community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nHowever, although both accounts are for automobile repossessions, they have different account numbers,\n3\ndifferent balances due, and different ownership.\n2\n\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the\nrelevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties for which she did not provide any documentation of efforts to resolve\nher debts.5\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. \nShe has not clearly documented any efforts to resolve them.  Applicant did not document\n6\nthat her financial problems were due to circumstances beyond her control, and she\ndocumented no efforts to resolve them, either after her subject interview or after she\nreceived the SOR or FORM.  Applicant has had no credit or financial counseling, and\n7\nthere is no evidence any of the debts are being resolved.  Her lack of effort does not\n8\nconstitute a good-faith effort to address her debts.  In addition, Applicant has not\n9\nSee, Department of the Navy v.

His request for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 22, 2017, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 15, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on February 23, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nMarch 6, 2018, scheduling the hearing for April 4, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The Government also submitted Government Exhibit 3 for \nAdministrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called his wife as an \nadditional witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through E, which were also \nadmitted without objection. Applicant requested the record remain open for the receipt \nof additional documentation. (Hearing Exhibit I.) Applicant Exhibits F through I were \nreceived in a timely fashion and admitted without objection. Applicant also submitted a \npost-hearing motion for a new hearing that was denied. (Hearing Exhibit II.) DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 16, 2018. The record closed on \nAugust 1, 2018. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Syrian Arab Republic (Syria). Department Counsel provided a six \npage summary of the facts, supported by five Government documents pertaining to \nSyria, identified as Government Exhibit 3. The documents provide elaboration and \ncontext for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. \nGovernment reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to \nreasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. 14-15.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and married. He is applying for a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment with a Defense contractor as a Quality Assurance \nInspector. (Applicant Exhibit F.)  \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Syria in 1985. He immigrated to the United States, along \nwith his parents, in 2006. Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in 2011. His \nparents are also naturalized American citizens. Applicant has three siblings, none of \nwhom live in Syria. (Tr. 24-28; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 9, 18.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is also from Syria. She moved to the United States in 2010 and \nthey were married in 2011. She became a naturalized American citizen in 2015. She is \nemployed by a governmental entity in the United States as an inspector. In addition, she \n\n \n3 \n \nteaches at an American university while continuing her education. Her family suffered \nreligious persecution in Syria. (Tr. 28-29, 41-42, 49-50.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are Syrian citizens. (Mr. and Mrs. A.) Mr. A works in \nconstruction and had been living in Saudi Arabia for several years. Mrs. A is a retired \nteacher and lived primarily in Syria, though she spends a substantial part of each year \nin Saudi Arabia with Mr. A. Neither one of them has any connection to the Syrian \ngovernment. Applicant has seen these people twice in person, the last time in 2011 \nwhen he got married in Syria. He has telephonic contact with them very seldom. \nApplicant\u2019s wife talks to her parents on approximately a weekly basis. (Tr. 30-32, 35-36, \n44-45.) \n \n \nMrs. A\u2019s sister, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s aunt, is an American citizen. She petitioned for \nMr. and Mrs. A to be allowed to immigrate to the United States in approximately 2004. \nThey received permission to submit a petition for an immigrant visa in 2016. The petition \nwas approved by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in early 2017. In May 2017 they began the process \nwith the Department of State\u2019s National Visa Center (NVC) to obtain immigrant visas. \n(Tr. 43-44; Answer.)  \n \n \nThrough an authorized third party Mr. and Mrs. A gathered the required \ndocuments, and also paid the required fees. This took several months, primarily \nbecause of the requirement to get a police check from the countries where Mr. and Mrs. \nA live. In this case that was both Syria and Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 33-34, 46-48; Applicant \nExhibits A and B.) \n \n \nNVC notified Mr. and Mrs. A that all the required paperwork was received on \nApril 11, 2018. At that point they entered the queue for an appointment with a consular \nofficial at the United States Embassy in Amman, Jordan. (Applicant Exhibit F.) \n \n \nMr. and Mrs. A were notified on June 2, 2018, that there interview was scheduled \nfor July 29, 2018. Mr. and Mrs. A were required to travel to Beirut, Lebanon and fly on a \nspecific airline flight to Amman at least five days before their interviews. Applicant \nsupplied a copy of the airline reservation for Mr. and Mrs. A that fulfilled this \nrequirement. No other information was available as the record closed. (Applicant \nExhibits H and I.) \n \n \nApplicant is proud to be an American citizen stating, \u201cI have to build myself from \nscratch. So United States allowed me to do so.\u201d Applicant has been taking college \nclasses in his area of work, achieving the Dean\u2019s List at his college in 2011. He is well-\nrespected at his job, receiving a promotion and other recognition. (Tr. 20-22, 24, 58; \nApplicant Exhibits C, D, E, F.) \n \n \nApplicant is very aware of his responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance, \nparticularly if advances are made toward him or his relatives. He is also aware of his \nemployer\u2019s requirements concerning foreign travel. (Tr. 55-57.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSyria \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Syria: Since 1979, \nthe United States has designated Syria a State Sponsor of Terrorism. There is an \nincreased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and westerners throughout Syria. The U.S. \nDepartment of State has a level 4 travel advisory in effect for Syria, which advises \nagainst all travel to Syria. (Government Exhibit 3: Attachments.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Syria. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. Syria has significant \ninternal anti-western terrorism threats that operate contrary to U.S. interests. \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s substantial and close family connections in that country have \nthe potential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a).1 \n                                                          \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his wife\u2019s parents in Syria. He last saw them \nin 2011, when he got married. Mr. and Mrs. A are in the process of immigrating to the \nUnited States. Applicant provided considerable documentary evidence showing that his \nin-laws have followed all the requirements to obtain an immigrant visa. Their interviews, \nthe final step in the immigration process, were scheduled to be held shortly before the \ndate the record closed in this case.  \n \nI have examined the fact that, as of the date the record closed, Applicant\u2019s wife \nstill had connections to Syria, since her parents were still there. Several facts support \nthe application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), (c), and (e). First, Applicant has little personal contact \nwith his in-laws, speaking to them only occasionally and last seeing them in 2011. \nSecond, both Applicant and his wife have substantial connections to the United States, \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n7 \n \nprimarily through their employment and the facts that his parents are already American \ncitizens living here, and her parents are working diligently to move to the United States \nlegally. Third, Applicant testified at length about his considerable knowledge of his \nemployer\u2019s security policies concerning foreign contacts and travel, and his own ability \nto follow them.  \n \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to follow appropriate rules in reporting any attempts by foreign actors to \ninfluence him. He is a proud American citizen, and he feels he has succeeded in this \ncountry on his own, without help from anyone. Applicant has completely mitigated the \nsecurity significance of the presence of his wife\u2019s parents in Syria. Paragraph 1 is found \nfor Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Syria. He moved to the United States in 2006, \nand is married to another naturalized American citizen. Applicant has shown himself to \nbe a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the defense industry. He \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States due to \nhis sense of loyalty to the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for national security eligibility and a security \n\n \n8 \n \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 12, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on February 28, 2019. On March 4, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \n\n \nscheduled for March 28, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \npresented the testimony of three other witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) \nA through D, which were admitted without objection.1 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) \non April 11, 2019. \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. At the hearing, I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Tr. 8.) Applicant\u2019s admissions in \nhis answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been married \nfor 21 years and has two daughters, ages 12 and 7. (Tr. 14.) He has been employed by \ndefense contractors since 2015, working as a lead test engineer, acquisition analyst, and \na U.S. Navy subject-matter expert on a contract supporting the U.S. Army. (AX D; Tr. 18.) \nHe served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 1994 to August 2014, when he \nretired as a lieutenant commander. (AX A-9.) During his active-duty service, Applicant \nreceived the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, four awards of the Navy and Marine \nCorps Commendation Medal, two awards of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal, and various service medals and qualification badges. (GX A-8.) \n \n \nIn March 2006, while Applicant was attending a one-year course of instruction at \na mid-level service school, he was found to have plagiarized a one-page book report. \nAccording to Applicant, he completed reading the book two days before the book report \nwas due and began working on the book report on the evening before it was due. He \ncame home from an off-duty masters-degree course at about 9:30 p.m., was involved in \na long argument with his wife, and did not begin working on the book report until midnight.3 \nHe found two online summaries of the book, and he copied one of them into his book \nreport without footnoting it. He paraphrased the other summary. When he was confronted \nwith the apparent plagiarism, he admitted it. (Tr. 24-26.) Although Applicant completed all \nthe academic requirements for the course, he was not allowed to graduate. (GX 3 through \n6.) However, he was able to use the academic credits from the service school to earn a \nmaster\u2019s degree from a civilian university. (AX C; Tr. 28-29.) \n \n \nAfter his tour of duty at the service school, Applicant was assigned overseas for \none year in an area where his wife, who was then pregnant, and his daughter could not \n                                                          \n1 AX A-2 through A-7 are duplicates of statements submitted with Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n3 Applicant and his wife were having marital difficulties due to her unhappiness about being uprooted for a \none-year assignment and his work schedule, which consisted of about eight hours a day in military classes \nand four and a half hours in the evening in master\u2019s degree classes. (Tr. 23-24.) \n\n \naccompany him. He was depressed by his experience at the service school and the family \nseparation, and he drank heavily. Nevertheless, he worked hard to overcome the negative \ninformation in his service record so that he could remain in the Navy and be entrusted \nwith a good assignment. (Tr. 51.) An Air Force major general, for whom he worked, \nsubmitted a letter describing Applicant\u2019s performance as \u201cstellar.\u201d He stated that Applicant \nwas embarrassed, deeply remorseful, had served with distinction, and had \u201cdemonstrated \nthe character required of leadership and the moral fortitude to serve.\u201d (AX A-2.)  \n3 \n \n \nAfter completing his one-year unaccompanied assignment, Applicant was \nreassigned to a major Navy command in another foreign country. He began binge drinking \nin September 2008, and in November 2008, he was detained by local police for drunk \ndriving. The local police turned him over to U.S. military authorities. A Navy admiral \nimposed nonjudicial punishment, which consisted of a letter of reprimand. (GX 2.) \n \n \nApplicant was required to complete a six-week Substance Abuse Rehabilitation \nProgram. (Tr. 33.) He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings twice a \nweek while overseas, and he attended them daily for a year and a half after he returned \nto the United States. He reduced his attendance to once a month and now attends when \nhe needs it. As of the date of the hearing, he had abstained from alcohol since September \n30, 2009. (Tr. 33-37.) His marriage is strong, and his wife is now his \u201csounding board\u201d \nand part of his support structure. (Tr. 79.) \n \n \nIn April 2010, Applicant was reassigned to duty in the United States. He anticipated \nthe periodic review of his security clearance, and he contacted his security officer to \nensure that the information in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) was \ncorrect. He noted that the nonjudicial punishment for drunk driving was not reflected, and \nhe self-reported it. (Tr. 39.) \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s retirement, he was employed by a defense contractor until he was \nterminated in August 2015. The notice of termination states that he was terminated for \n\u201cfailure to uphold the firm\u2019s time reporting policy.\u201d (GX 7.) It does not recite any specific \nfailures or the nature of the failures. The termination notice stated that he was not eligible \nfor rehire.  \n \nAn audit of Applicant\u2019s time reporting was triggered after he used a mobile \napplication to report his time. He found the mobile application difficult to use because it \nwas hard to see and use the keys. On one day, he accidently entered nine hours of work \nwhen he worked only eight, and on another day in the same pay period he entered eight \nhours of work when he should have entered eight hours of leave. His supervisor caught \nthe errors but could not change them because the time card had already been submitted. \nInstead, his supervisor reported the discrepancies, and an investigation of Applicant\u2019s \ntime reports followed. (Tr. 41.)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he was informed that an audit of \nbadge records showed that he worked 205.5 hours less that what he claimed to have \nworked during January to July 2015. He requested an opportunity to review the badge \n\n \nrecords. His employer declined his request but informed him that he could obtain the \nbadge records from the Navy. Although it appears that the badge records were \nconsidered by the employer\u2019s disciplinary committee, they were not included in the \nevidence submitted by Department Counsel or Applicant. The record contains no \ndocumentary evidence of the badge records or any other documentation of the basis for \nhis employer\u2019s decision to terminate him. \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he obtained the badge records from the Navy, and he \nconcluded that there was a problem with the badging system in the Navy building where \nhe worked. He testified that he asked his employer about an opportunity to respond to the \nallegations, and he was informed that he would not have an opportunity to appear before \nthe disciplinary committee or to present evidence. (Tr. 44-45.) He testified that he had \nonly three days from when he received the badge records until he was summoned to the \nmeeting at which he was informed of his termination. He did not have sufficient time to \ncompile evidence showing that he was at work on the days which the badge records \nshowed him as absent. He was working on a high-profile, voluminous war-game \nhandbook that required long hours, and he is confident that his absence would have been \nnoted if he had been absent for over 200 hours. (Tr. 74-77.) \n \nAfter Applicant was terminated, he was hired as a subcontractor for the former \nemployer who terminated him. Applicant was able to retain his security clearance \nbecause his former employer approved his employment as a subcontractor and \nsponsored him for a clearance. (Tr. 21.) He worked as a subcontractor for his former \nemployer from mid-November 15, 2015 to October 31, 2016. (Tr. 49.) \n \nWhen Applicant applied for unemployment benefits, the state employment \ncommission determined that his former employer had failed to provide sufficient evidence \nto support a finding of willful misconduct. The commission\u2019s written decision does not \naddress whether the evidence supported a \u201cfailure to uphold the firm\u2019s time reporting \npolicy\u201d (the language used in the notice of termination) based on conduct not amounting \nto willful misconduct. The commission determined that Applicant was qualified for \nunemployment benefits. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A-10.) \n \n \nA close friend of Appellant who has known him for more than 30 years testified \nand submitted a statement on his behalf. The friend noticed that Applicant was drinking \nheavily before the plagiarism and DUI incidents, and the DUI was the trigger for changing \nhis drinking habits. Now that Applicant has stopped drinking, he has become more \npositive and more involved with his family. The friend considers Applicant trustworthy, \nhonest, and a \u201csolid guy.\u201d (AX A-3; Tr. 83-88.) \n \n \nThe owner of the company for which Applicant was an acquisition analyst testified \nand submitted a statement. Applicant told him about the incidents in the SOR. This \nwitness described Applicant as an \u201cexceptional employee.\u201d He regards Applicant as \ndirect, honest, and loyal. He has no hesitation in recommending that Applicant retain his \nsecurity clearance. (AX A-5; Tr. 90-95.) \n\n \n \nA retired Navy captain, who is a defense contractor for whom Appellant previously \nworked, testified and submitted a statement. The Navy captain was instrumental in \npersuading the employer who terminated Applicant to accept him as a subcontractor and \nsponsor him for a clearance. The Navy captain has no concerns about Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, integrity, or trustworthiness. He regards Applicant as a \u201cstraight arrow\u201d and he \nwould trust him with his life. He testified that \u201ccommon sense\u201d would suggest that \nApplicant could not have been absent for almost five weeks with no one noticing. He also \nfound it \u201cremarkable\u201d that the employer who fired Applicant accepted him as a \nsubcontractor and facilitated the continuance of his security clearance. (AX A-6; Tr. 96-\n109.) \n5 \n \n \n \nA retired Navy chief petty officer submitted a statement describing how Applicant \npersuaded him to enlist in the Navy and how Applicant helped him gain control of his \nalcohol problems in later life. He considers Applicant straightforward, honest, and \ntrustworthy. (AX A-4.) \n \n \nA long-time friend of Applicant, who has known him since high school and has \nbeen employed as an attorney for a government agency since 2010, submitted a \nstatement. She is aware that Applicant is a recovering alcoholic. She considers him \nstraightforward, honest, and trustworthy. (AX A-7.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n\n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n6 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was guilty of plagiarism in 2006, while a student \nat a military school, and he was not allowed to graduate (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges that \nhe received nonjudicial punishment for drunk driving in November 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nFinally, it alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment by a defense contractor \nfor falsifying his time card (SOR \u00b6 1.d). 4 \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d The relevant disqualifying \nconditions are: \n                                                          \n4 For reasons not reflected in the record, the SOR is more specific than the notice of termination. \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or \nother employer's time or resources.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s plagiarism alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the DUI alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b are \nestablished by the evidence and are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d). The \nplagiarism and DUI were previously considered and favorably adjudicated.  \n \n \nThe trigger for revoking Applicant\u2019s clearance was his termination for failing to \nfollow his employer\u2019s time-reporting requirements. The record does not reflect what \nevidence the employer considered to support termination. After Applicant obtained the \nNavy\u2019s badge records, he did not dispute that they showed more than 200 hours less than \nthe work he reported, but he asserted that it was a badging problem that generated \ninaccurate information. He produced no evidence supporting his assertion. However, it is \nsignificant that the state employment commission investigated the basis for Applicant\u2019s \ntermination and found insufficient evidence to warrant a finding of willful misconduct. It is \nalso significant that the employer who fired him allowed him to work as a subcontractor \nand facilitated the reactivation of his security clearance. While Applicant may have been \ncareless or inept in submitting his time reports, the evidence is insufficient to establish \nintentional falsification, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. An unintentional or innocent falsification \nwould not raise a security concern.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \n\n \n8 \n \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the plagiarism and the DUI, which are mitigated by \nthe passage of time. AG \u00b6 17(d) is established for the DUI, because Applicant obtained \ncounseling, became involved in AA, and has abstained from alcohol for more than nine \nyears. AG \u00b6 17(f) is established for Applicant\u2019s termination for falsifying his time card, \nwhich is unsubstantiated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).5  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I found that Applicant was remorseful, candid, \nsincere, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his personal \nconduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n                                                          \n5 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 3, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On November 29, 2017, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n12/21/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on December 18, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated \nJanuary 31, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to \nproceed on March 5, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. A Notice \nof Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July 24, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3 and Administrative \nexhibit I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant did not offer any \nApplicant exhibits (AE). Applicant testified. Based on information presented during the \nhearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following \nlanguage: \u201cYou failed to timely file your annual federal income tax returns for tax years \n2012 through 2015.\u201d There was no objection to the motion, and the motion was granted, \nthereby amending the SOR by adding SOR \u00b6 1.b.1 The transcript (Tr.) was received on \nAugust 2, 2018. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took \nadvantage of that opportunity and timely submitted documents, which were marked and \nadmitted into evidence as AE A through AE M without objection. The record closed on \nAugust 20, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the initial \nSOR (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).

Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a systems analyst with his current employer since December 2016. He is a 1988 high \nschool graduate, and received an associate\u2019s degree in 1992. In 1995-1996, he was an \nordained minister. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a \nposition of public trust. Applicant was married in 1996, separated in 2014, and divorced \nin 2017. He remarried in April 2018. He has two children, born in 1999 and 2001. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 76-78; Administrative exhibit I (Text of Proposed SOR Amendment).   \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations2 \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to several different factors: he had \npersonal family life issues involving a wife who lost her teaching position; she \nmismanaged their money and \u201cself-medicated\u201d by spending money on clothing and eating \nout; she totaled her vehicle; estate tax issues arose involving an estate inherited by his \nwife; more tax issues arose in 2011 over capital gains when he cashed in a pension plan \nto generate funds to enable him to resolve some of his growing financial debt; their house \nwas foreclosed in 2013; he was unemployed from May 2014 until August 2014; his federal \nincome tax refund for the tax year 2016 was withheld by the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) and applied to his outstanding tax debt; and Applicant and his wife were separated \nfor three years before finally divorcing. In addition, although they shared custody of the \nchildren, Applicant kept physical custody of their children and did not receive any financial \nsupport from his wife.3  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP in February 2017, he reported that he had \nfailed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through \n2015, and that he had failed to pay his federal and state taxes for the same period.4 \nHowever, during his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in August 2017, Applicant changed the narrative and contended he \nhad timely filed his income tax returns for that period, and was sent refunds, claiming his \ne-QIP entries were in error.5 In his Answer to the SOR and during the hearing, Applicant \nacknowledged that the filings had not yet taken place.6 Although he claimed that he had, \nat one point, entered into an Installment Agreement with the IRS, he acknowledged that \nhe had failed to make any payments under it for fear that his checks might bounce. He \nalso denied that he has been in contact, in writing or by telephone, with the IRS for \napproximately five years for anything associated with those tax years.7 During his hearing, \nApplicant said that he was now in a position to start paying his delinquent taxes and some \nretail credit debt about which he was not aware.8  \n                                                          \n2 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated February 3, 2017); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated August \n9, 2017); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated May 26, 2017); and \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated January 31, 2018.  \n \n3 Tr. at 21-22, 24-32, 35-37: GE 2, supra note 2, at 7-8. \n \n4 GE 1, supra note 2, at 36-39. \n \n5 GE 2, supra note 2, at 5-7. \n \n6 Tr. at 37. \n \n7 Tr. at 41-42. \n8 Tr. at 44. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and \notherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIn August 2018, Applicant asserted that he had finally filed his federal income tax \nreturns for the tax years 2010 through 2016.9 The U.S. Individual Income Tax Return \n(Form 1040) for 2010, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $82,032, was dated August \n1, 2018;10 the Forms 1040 for 2011, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $76,945,11 \nand 2012, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $76,969,12 were dated August 2, 2018; \nthe Form 1040 for 2013, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $46,229, was dated \nAugust 3, 2018;13 the Form 1040 for 2014, reflecting an adjusted gross income of \n$58,427, was dated August 5, 2018;14 and the Forms 1040 for 2015, reflecting an \nadjusted gross income of $72,246,15 and 2016, reflecting an adjusted gross income of \n$72,515,16 were dated August 6, 2018 \u2013 all clearly beyond the required initial or extended \ndates of filing.17 \n \nOn August 10, 2018, Applicant submitted an Installment Agreement Request \n(Form 9465) to the IRS, stating that he owed the IRS $12,506 in unpaid taxes, interest, \nand penalties, and offered to pay the IRS a monthly $340 under the requested \n                                                          \n \n \n9 AE A (E-mail to Department Counsel, dated August 17, 2018); AE B (Letter, dated August 16, \n2018). \n10 AE D (Form 1040, dated August 1, 2018). \n \n11 AE E (Form 1040, dated August 2, 2018). \n \n12 AE F (Form 1040, dated August 2, 2018). \n \n13 AE G (Form 1040, dated August 3, 2018). \n \n14 AE H (Form 1040, dated August 5, 2018). \n \n15 AE I (Form 1040, dated August 6, 2018). \n \n16 AE J (Form 1040, dated August 6, 2018). \n \n             17 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual\u2019s gross \nincome and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the \nfollowing applies: \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title \nor by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or \nsupply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such \nreturn, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law \nor regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 \n($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, \ntogether with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom \nthere is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with \nrespect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect \nto such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first \nsentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \"misdemeanor\" and \"5 \nyears\" for \"1 year.\" \n  \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nagreement.18 He sent a check to the IRS for $300 that same day.19 Applicant offered no \ndocumentation from the IRS to indicate that his Installment Agreement Request had been \napproved. In addition, he offered no explanation for paying the IRS less than he had \npromised to pay under the Installment Agreement Request, or if he had continued making \nsubsequent payments in compliance with the proposed Request. \n \nIn addition to his difficulties with respect to his federal income tax returns and the \ntaxes he still owes the IRS, Applicant also had two delinquent debts that were not alleged \nin the SOR.20 Although one account became delinquent in 2011 and the other account \nbecame delinquent in 2017, and at least one of them was discussed during his OPM \ninterview in August 2017, Applicant did not attempt to resolve one debt until he made a \npayment of $295.94 on July 31, 2018, thereby paying it off.21 During the hearing, he \ndiscussed the other, earlier debt, and stated that he intended to get it resolved as well, \nbut he offered no evidence to indicate that any further efforts to do so had been made.  \nIn August 2018, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement to indicate \nmonthly income, monthly expenses, and debts. He reported $7,609 in combined net \nmonthly income; and $5,410 in monthly expenses, including $320 in federal taxes. Among \nhis debts are monthly payments of $430 on his Lexus vehicle. He reported a monthly \nremainder of $419 available for discretionary spending or savings.22  \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever received financial counseling. While \nthere is evidence of two recent, post-hearing payments on both SOR and non-SOR \ndelinquent debts, nearly a year after the SOR was issued, and there is evidence of a \nmodest monthly remainder, there is little meaningful evidence to indicate that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation is now under control.  \n \n \n                                                          \n \n18 AE K (Form 9465, dated August 10, 2018). \n \n19 AE L (Check, dated August 10, 2018). \n \n20 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.).

DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained \nin the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.24  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d25 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.26  \n                                                          \n23 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n24 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n25 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n26 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.27 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b619:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n                                                          \n27 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 \nthrough 2015 until August 2018, well after the SOR was issued; failed to pay annual \nfederal individual income taxes as required; and, as of August 2018, according to \nApplicant, he still owed the IRS $12,506 in unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties. Applicant \ncontended that his failure to timely file those federal income tax returns was because he \ndid not have sufficient funds to pay his taxes. The requirement to file is separate from the \nrequirement to pay. The failure to timely file income tax returns has security and \ntrustworthiness implications because:28  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that an applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness, or by inference trustworthiness, in light of his or her \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file \nfederal income tax returns.29 In this instance, while Applicant may now be properly \nmotivated, and he has finally taken the appropriate actions to actually file his federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2015, there is still insufficient evidence \nto demonstrate that he is paying his back taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been \nestablished, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has been partially established.  \n \n                                                          \n28 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n31 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties make it \ndifficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \n\u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant generally attributed his financial difficulties to an ex-wife\u2019s \nvarious issues; his own problems in 2011 over capital gains taxes when he cashed in a \npension plan to generate funds to enable him to resolve some of his growing financial \ndebt; their house was foreclosed in 2013; he was unemployed from May 2014 until August \n2014; his federal income tax refund for the tax year 2016 was withheld by the IRS and \napplied to his outstanding tax debt; and Applicant and his wife were separated for three \nyears before finally divorcing. While those are factors, without more details as how they \nimpacted Applicant\u2019s finances, it is difficult to determine to what degree they were largely \nbeyond his control, or how he dealt with them. \nHowever, they separated in 2014, and with the exception of the tax years 2013 \nand 2014, Applicant\u2019s annual adjusted gross income improved and was generally in \nexcess of $72,000. While his federal income tax returns were finally filed in August 2018, \nthere is limited evidence that he made any reasonable efforts to file his income tax returns \nor voluntarily pay his back taxes until well after the SOR was issued as well as after the \nhearing was conducted. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of any \nfinancial counseling. There is no evidence of disputes. Applicant offered some evidence \nto indicate that his financial situation is now under better control. Applicant\u2019s actions under \nthe circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.32 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, especially after a multi-year delay in taking any action, without further confirmed \naction, are insufficient. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may be lacking \nin the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there \nis no immediate threat to his or her own interests.33 In this instance, to date, there is \nminimal meaningful evidence that corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. While \nApplicant claimed to have insufficient funds to pay his federal or state income tax over \n                                                          \n32 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n33 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nseveral years, or to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through \n2015, the evidence regarding his adjusted gross income over a substantial period reveals \nthat his adjusted gross income appears to be more than sufficient to make at least some \nmodest payments well before the SOR was issued. Purchasing a Lexus seems to indicate \nthere were some funds available to make those modest tax payments. Applicant\u2019s \nactions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.34 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.35  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 49-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a systems analyst with his \ncurrent employer since December 2016. Although he failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2015, he finally filed them in August \n2018. He also reached out to the IRS and requested an Installment Agreement. Applicant \nmade one modest tax payment to the IRS. He also paid off one non-SOR debt. He has \n$419 available each month for discretionary spending or savings.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2010 through \n2015 until August 2018, well after the SOR was issued; failed to pay annual federal \nindividual income taxes as required; and, as of August 2018, he still owed the IRS $12,506 \n                                                          \n34 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n35 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nin unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties. He did not engage the IRS over his unfiled income \ntax returns for five years, and did not request an Installment Agreement until after the \nhearing was held. He made one modest payment to the IRS and another modest payment \nto resolve a non-SOR debt after the hearing. Considering all of the above, I am unable to \nreach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:36 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, seemingly avoiding the filing of his federal income tax returns for \nseveral years as well as failing to make income tax payments, until well after the SOR \nwas issued. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                          \n36 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 15, 2018, Applicant owed $24,594 in defaulted Federal student-loan debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j), a $116 medical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and state education debts in collection for $2,978 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) and $10,185 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). In his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant admitted the debts, but he also provided payment receipts to show that the amount of his indebtedness was incorrect. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 27 years old and married. He graduated from high school in June 2009 and pursued university studies between August 2009 and May 2014 with a break from September 2010 to January 2012.1 He has yet to earn a degree. Applicant has been a member of the National Guard since November 2010. He has worked part time or full time for several companies as a security guard since March 2013, at times holding more than one job. As of May 2016, Applicant was being sponsored for security clearance eligibility for part-time work as a security guard on a military base.2 (Item 3.) 1 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he attended college from August 2009 to September 2010 and resumed his studies at a different university from August 2012 to May 2014.

Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant defaulted on approximately $22,379 in Federal student loans, $13,163 in \nstate university debts, and a $116 medical debt. The medical debt and state university \ndebts have been fully satisfied. He made $200 monthly payments toward his Federal \nstudent loans for over a year before formally entering a loan-rehabilitation program in July \n2018. A conditional security clearance is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n12/26/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn April 19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On May 24, 2018, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a \ncopy of the FORM to Applicant on June 7, 2018, and instructed him to respond within 45 \ndays of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on June 19, 2018, and he submitted a timely \nresponse that was accepted without any objections by the Government on August 29, \n2018. On October 11, 2018, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I \nreceived the case assignment on October 15, 2018, and accepted Applicant\u2019s FORM \nresponse in the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 a summary report of subject interviews of \nApplicant conducted on March 2, 2017, February 28, 2017, and May 9, 2017. The \nsummary report was part of the DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personnel background report of investigation may \nbe received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is \notherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not \nbear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In a footnote, the FORM \nadvised Applicant of the following:  \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 4) [sic] is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that \nthe report is unauthenticated by a Government witness and the document \nmay not be considered as evidence. If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \n\n3 \n \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case.  \n  \n  \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. He did not file any objections in his rebuttal (AE A) \nto the FORM. In the absence of any objections or indication that the interview summary \nreport contains inaccurate information, I accepted Item 4 in evidence, subject to issues of \nrelevance and materiality in light of the entire record.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 15, 2018, Applicant owed \n$24,594 in defaulted Federal student-loan debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j), a $116 medical collection \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and state education debts in collection for $2,978 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) and \n$10,185 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). In his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant admitted the debts, but \nhe also provided payment receipts to show that the amount of his indebtedness was \nincorrect. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item \n2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 27 years old and married. He graduated from high school in June 2009 \nand pursued university studies between August 2009 and May 2014 with a break from \nSeptember 2010 to January 2012.1  He has yet to earn a degree. Applicant has been a \nmember of the National Guard since November 2010. He has worked part time or full time \nfor several companies as a security guard since March 2013, at times holding more than \none job. As of May 2016, Applicant was being sponsored for security clearance eligibility \nfor part-time work as a security guard on a military base.2 (Item 3.) \n                                                 \n1 Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he attended college from August 2009 to September 2010 and resumed \nhis studies at a different university from August 2012 to May 2014. (Item 3.) He discrepantly advised an Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in March 2017 that he had withdrawn from the first university in \nSeptember 2011. (Item 4.) Available credit reports show no Federal student loans obtained after the spring \nsemester of 2010 until the spring semester of 2012. His tuition debt to the first university was in collection for \n$10,185 as of October 2011. \n   \n2 At my request, Department Counsel confirmed in October 2018 that Applicant was still being sponsored for \nsecurity clearance eligibility by the employer listed first in response to the employment activities inquiry on his \nMay 2016 security clearance application (SF 86). I marked his email noting the sponsorship as a file exhibit for \nthe administrative record. Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he left \nthe company in June 2016 after less than one month for a full-time position with another Federal contractor. \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant obtained ten Federal student loans for college totaling $22,379 between \nOctober 2009 and January 2014 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j). He incurred another $10,185 in \neducational debt to the university that he attended from August 2009 to September 2010. \n(Item 3.) Applicant withdrew from the university only two or three days into the semester \nwhen his mother became ill, but it was too late to negate his tuition obligation. He could not \nafford to make the initial payment, which was 20% of the balance owed. As of October \n2011, his account was in collection for $10,185 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). (Items 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed until November 2010, when he joined the National \nGuard. He had no other income apart from his part-time Guard duties until October 2012, \nwhen he began working as a bouncer at a bar on the weekends. He resumed his college \nstudies at another state university in 2012, and his Federal student loans were deferred. In \nMarch 2013, he began working full time as a night-shift supervisor for a company that \nprovides mall security while continuing to take college classes and work as a bouncer. In \nMarch 2015, he took on a part-time job as a security guard with a security company. Five \nmonths later, he was offered a full-time position with the security company, and he left his \njob in mall security. In January 2016, he began working for company X as a part-time \n\u201cFederal armed security officer\u201d while also working for the security company. In May 2016, \nhe took on another part-time job, as a security officer on a military base for his current \nemployer. (Item 3.) \n \n \nNeeding a clearance for his job on the military base, Applicant completed and \ncertified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May \n11, 2016. He listed his civilian employments and also his Guard duty. He indicated that he \nhad been investigated for a security clearance for his duties with company X, but he had \nnot been granted a clearance. He listed a Secret clearance granted to him in 2011, \npresumably for his Guard duties. In response to the financial record inquiries, Applicant \ndisclosed that he owed approximately $26,000 in delinquent Federal student loans and \nexplained: \n \nA payment plan exists it was set up in 2014, no payments have been made \nas of yet because the loan[s] were deferred up until February (est) of this \nyear. Payment should still be defed [sic] as I am enrolled in the [military] \nStudent Loan repayment. I am 87 Days Delinquent. \n \n \nApplicant added that he would establish a payment plan as soon as he returned to a \nfull-time position. Applicant also indicated that he owed $9,997 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) to the \nuniversity he first attended because he had withdrawn from classes. He added that the \nstate withheld his income tax refund for tax year 2015, but that the debt was not fully \nresolved. Applicant disclosed another $3,500 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) for his college studies in \n2014. Under the additional comment section, Applicant explained that his educational \ndebts to the state were in the process of being placed on a repayment plan. (Item 3.) \n \n \nAs of August 2016, Applicant\u2019s Federal student-loan debt had accrued to $25,610. \nHe was in default since May 2016, when his loans came out of deferment. His student \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(Item 4.) \n\n5 \n \ndebts with the state were in collection for $10,185 and $2,978. Applicant was making timely \npayments of $279 per month on an $11,205 five-year auto loan obtained in July 2015. He \nhad three open credit card accounts that were rated as current. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant left his employment with company X because of a \nmilitary deployment with his Guard unit. He was on a military installation preparing for \ndeployment when, on March 2, 2017, he was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He provided the OPM investigator with a \nletter from the U.S. Department of Education notifying him that his loans were in default \nand that he had 60 days to make repayment arrangements before his default status would \nbe reported to the credit bureaus. The balance of his loans was then $27,054 ($25,690 in \nprincipal and $1,364 in interest). (Item 7.) He could not afford the $275 monthly payments \ninitially required in repayment because of a lack of full-time work. Applicant acknowledged \nthat the loans had been 87 days delinquent as of May 2016, but he was enrolled in a \nmilitary student-loan repayment program. He expressed his intention to immediately \narrange for repayment and to pay at least $500 per month toward the loans during his \nimpending deployment from April 2017 to April 2018.3 About his state education debts, \nApplicant explained that he became delinquent on the account in SOR \u00b6 1.m one year after \nhe withdrew from the university, and he could not afford the required first payment of 20% \nof the balance. The other debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) became delinquent in August 2015. He provided \nevidence of a $200 payment in February 2017, which was allocated between his two state \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m), and added that the state took his $600 income tax refund in \npartial repayment. He expressed an intention to continue to make $200 payments. \nApplicant described his financial situation as good in that he was meeting his financial \nobligations on time. (Item 4.) \n \n \nOn February 28, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator about \nhis college debts. He provided documentation showing that the state withheld his income \ntax refund of $607, and that he made payments of $200 on January 23, 2017, and again \non March 5, 2017, which were split between his two accounts. Applicant was re-contacted \nabout the debts on May 9, 2017, but was unable to provide any additional information. \n(Item 4.) \n \n \nAs of late October 2017, Equifax was reporting that Applicant owed past-due \nFederal student loan balances totaling $26,416. A $116 medical debt from December 2016 \nhad been placed for collection in May 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). Applicant had not been late on his \ncar loan or credit-card payments. (Item 6.) \n \n \nOn February 15, 2018, the DOD CAF issued a SOR to Applicant because of his \ncollege debts and the $116 medical collection debt. (Item 1.) Applicant asserted in April \n2018 that his Federal student loans were now current. He explained that, in the process of \nmoving, he was not aware that his Federal student loans had become 180 days overdue. \nHe provided documentation showing that he made $200 monthly payments from March 14, \n                                                 \n3 Applicant had apparently not been deployed as of May 9, 2017, when he was interviewed in person by an \nOPM investigator. The investigator subsequently had no success in contacting Applicant because he was \ndeployed until January 2018. (Item 4.) \n\n6 \n \n2017, through March 8, 2018, toward his Federal loans, of which almost $1,895 went to \npay interest on the loans in 2017. Applicant maintained that he had paid the $116 medical \ncollection debt, although he provided no proof. He provided documentation of credit-card \npayments totaling $3,003 between January 23, 2017, and December 8, 2017, to resolve \nthe college debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, and of three credit-card payments of $100 each between \nJanuary 2017 and May 2017 toward his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. (Item 2.) In rebuttal to the \nFORM, Applicant provided a payment receipt showing that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m was fully \nsatisfied as of December 11, 2017, with $2,977.95 collected by the state at that time. (AE \nA.) \n \n \nOn July 23, 2018, Applicant entered into a formal loan rehabilitation program for his \nFederal student loans then totaling $25,609, inclusive of interest. Applicant agreed to make \nat least nine monthly payments of $228 beginning on July 28, 2018. Because he was \nrehabilitating Direct Loans (Item 7), he was required to complete the initial payment and at \nleast eight of the other required monthly payments within a ten month period starting in July \n2018. On rehabilitation of the loans, the loan servicer will set a new monthly payment \namount and due date. (AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on his Federal student loans initially totaling $22,379, and on \n$13,163 in state-university debts. A $116 medical debt was referred for collection after he \nfailed to pay it before his recent military deployment. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d \nare established. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nFour of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some consideration and could potentially \napply in whole or in part. They are: \n\n8 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe medical collection debt from 2016 is minor and was likely just overlooked as \nApplicant prepared for deployment with the Guard. His defaults of his Federal student \nloans and of his obligations to the state for his education raise security concerns that are \nnot mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). His Federal student loans became 180 days past due after \nhis latest deferment ended in May 2016. His state debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l became delinquent in \nAugust 2015. His state debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m was placed for collection in 2011, but a debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-\n06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. \n13, 2016)). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s illness led him to \nwithdraw from school only a few days after the semester started in 2010. He could not pay \nthe tuition debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m because he had no income apart from his part-time duties \nwith the Guard. Regarding his more recent education debt, Applicant did not offer an \nexplanation for why he did not continue to pursue a degree after 2014. He was working as \na security guard when the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l came due. The file contains no specifics about \nhis income or expenses, although it is noted that his debt repayment commenced during \nhis deployment with the Guard, when he would have had extra income to make those \npayments. \n \n \nApplicant received documentation in February 2017 advising him that his Federal \nstudent loans were in default and that he had 60 days to make repayment arrangements \nbefore his loans would be reported in default status to the credit bureaus. Applicant \nindicated during his subject interview in early March 2017 that he would immediately make \nrepayment arrangements. Available payment records show that he began making $200 \n\n9 \n \nmonthly payments on March 14, 2017. He continued to make the payments through at \nleast March 2018. In its FORM, the Government expressed concern that Applicant had not \nprovided documentation to show that he had a repayment arrangement. Applicant \nthereafter entered into a formal loan rehabilitation program in late July 2018. The file \ncontains no evidence about whether he has complied with the terms of the rehabilitation \nprogram. However, his $200 monthly Federal student-loan payments made between March \n2017 and March 2018, 12 of which predate the issuance of the SOR, constitute a good-\nfaith effort to address his delinquent student loans under AG \u00b6 20(d). Regarding the state \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, he submitted a letter in response to the FORM showing that the debt \nwas fully satisfied as of December 2017. Applicant documented his payments totaling \n$3,003 in 2017 toward the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, so that debt was apparently satisfied as well. I \naccept Applicant\u2019s assertion that he paid the $116 medical debt, given his track record of \npayments on his education debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and \u00b6 20(d) fully apply in mitigation of the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.m. \n \n \nAfter at least 13 months of payments toward his Federal student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.j), Applicant\u2019s balance was a substantial $25,609 as of late July 2018. An applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off every debt in the SOR. He is \nrequired to demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial problems \nand taken significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Applicant\u2019s track \nrecord of payments on his Federal loans before he entered the loan-rehabilitation program \ninspire confidence that he will make the nine monthly payments of $228 each to fully \nrehabilitate them. While it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c) in mitigation of his \nFederal student-loan delinquencies without some evidence of compliance with the loan- \nrehabilitation program, student loans are an investment in one\u2019s future and do not carry the \nsame judgment concerns as would excessive credit card debt. Applicant has no record of \nirresponsible spending or overreliance on consumer credit card debt. He has a record of \ntimely payments on his credit cards and car loan. In that regard, he has shown that he can \nmanage his expenses responsibly, provided he has the income to do so. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s situation is not unlike that of many students of his generation who take \nout loans for their college education expecting to land a job at some future date at an \nincome sufficient to repay them, but then find themselves underemployed when the loans \ncome due. It is all the more difficult to find a well-paying job when an applicant has yet to \nearn a degree. Because Applicant requested a decision on the written record without a \nhearing, much remains unknown about his circumstances, his income, and his expenses. \nApplicant has worked more than one job at a time for the income needed to meet his living \n\n10 \n \nexpenses. His service in the Guard weighs in his favor under the whole-person concept, \nand he began and continued making monthly payments toward his educational loans when \nhe was deployed. Applicant\u2019s candor about his delinquencies reflects positively on his \nsecurity clearance suitability. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. At \nthe same time, Applicant owes a considerable debt to the Federal government. In \nexceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated.4 Applicant\u2019s record of debt repayment starting in January 2017 favors \ngranting a conditional clearance in this case. In exercising this discretionary authority, I \nhave carefully considered and weighed the financial considerations security concerns and \ndecided Applicant earned an opportunity to show that he can be counted on to rehabilitate \nand continue to repay his Federal student loans. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is conditioned on him providing documentation to his facility security officer of his \nFederal student loan balance; of his loan-rehabilitation plan and compliance payments; and \nof payments for an additional six months after his loans are current to demonstrate that he \nhas the ability and willingness to make the payments set by the loan servicer after the \nloans are rehabilitated.5 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                 \n4 Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative judges the \ndiscretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an \nissue(s) that can be partially but not completely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. \nSee also Memorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January 12, 2018 \n(\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making adjudicative decisions to \ngrant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position . . . \nEffective immediately, authority to grant clearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated in \nAppendix C is granted to any adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant \nclearance eligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \n \n5 The above conditions are easily verifiable and place the reporting requirement on the Applicant. Currently, \nDOHA administrative judges do not have the authority to compel a third party, such as an employer, to monitor \na person\u2019s compliance with conditions. However, a facility security officer has an independent obligation to \nreport to the Government any information raising a security concern, including a cleared employee\u2019s failure to \nmake his student loan payments. \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance subject to the aforesaid \nconditions. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 28, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \n \nOn January 17, 2018, and February 5, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to another administrative judge (AJ1) on \nAugust 27, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice \n\n \n2 \n \n \nof hearing that same day, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on September \n7, 2018. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and offered exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C, which were admitted without objection. The record remained open until \nSeptember 21, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence. He submitted one \nadditional document that was marked by the judge as Post-hearing Exhibit A and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr1.) on September \n17, 2018. \n \n \nOn October 26, 2018, AJ1 issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant appealed that decision to the DOHA Appeal Board \n(Appeal Board) and on March 6, 2019, the Appeal Board issued a decision remanding \nthe case to another judge for a new hearing. \n \nThe remanded case was assigned to me on March 7, 2019. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on March 29, 2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nApril 11, 2019. By email dated April 4, 2019, I informed both parties that I had read and \nreviewed all the testimony and exhibits from the first hearing and that I intended to \nconsider that evidence for this hearing. I informed them that only new evidence should \nbe offered at the remand hearing, although I further stated that Applicant would have \nthe opportunity to testify again if he desired.1 \n \nAt the remand hearing, the Government called one witness and did not offer any \ndocuments. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, but did not offer any exhibits at the \ntime. The record remained open until April 26, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence. He submitted one additional document that was marked as remand \nexhibit (RAE) A and admitted without objection. An email string from Applicant showing \nhis consent on closing the record is reflected by remand hearing exhibit (RHE) I. The \nrecord was then closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr2.) on April 26, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nI amended SOR \u00b6 1.b to reflect the date of \u201cAugust 16, 2016\u201d and SOR \u00b6 1.c to \nreflect the date of \u201cAugust 17, 2016\u201d to conform to the evidence produced during the \nremand hearing.2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, but provided explanations, which \nessentially denied the underlying conduct of each allegation. After a thorough and \ncareful review of all the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \n                                                          \n1 Remand Hearing Exhibit (RHE) I (April 4, 2019 email to Applicant and Department Counsel (p.4-5)). \n \n2 Directive (enclosure 3 at E3.1.17) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He worked for a government contractor (GC3) \nemployer most recently beginning in October 2016 until he lost his clearance. \nPreviously, he worked for a different government contractor (GC1) from September \n2015 to August 2016. From January 2015 to September 2015, he worked for a \npredecessor government contractor (GC2). GC1 took over the contract GC2 had with \nthe Air Force (AF) and Applicant was retained as an employee for GC1. The allegations \nin this case arise from his employment with GC1. He is married with three children. He \nhas a master\u2019s degree.3   \n \n \nApplicant is a medically retired warrant officer from the U.S. Army. He served for \n13 years. He was retired because of injuries sustained while deployed to Afghanistan. \nHe received the Army Commendation Medal and two Air Medals for his service. He \nreceived a 90 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for \nhis service-connected injuries.4   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged: (1) that on June 9, 2016, Applicant replied to an email stating \n\u201ccomply and adjust fire\u201d after being instructed to come to work and leave work on time; \n(2) that on August 16, 2016, Applicant made a statement regarding \u201cretaliation\u201d after \nfinishing a discussion with his program manager (PM); (3) that on August 17, 2016, \nApplicant stated \u201cmisquoting me is dangerous\u201d after walking out of a meeting with his \nPM; (4) that on August 18, 2016, Applicant stated to a coworker \u201cprepare to go to war in \nfive minutes\u201d that led the coworker to report this statement and Applicant\u2019s behavior to \ncommand officials; (5) that in August 2016, Applicant was terminated from his \nemployment for erratic behavior.   \n \n \n \nJune 9, 2016 Comment. The factual basis for this allegation was stated in a \nJoint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) report written by GC1\u2019s security manager, \nwho had no first-hand knowledge of any of the allegations, but received input from \nApplicant\u2019s PM who was his first-level supervisor. AF personnel had become concerned \nwith Applicant\u2019s hours of work schedule. On the morning of June 9, 2016, the AF \ncontracting representative (CR) sent Applicant an email setting forth the expectation of \nApplicant regarding his work schedule.5 At 1:44 pm, the same day, Applicant replied to \nthe CR\u2019s email and copied his PM along with several other people. The text of the email \nwas: \n \nAfter writing and deleting a response about seven times I will just say, \nthanks for the candid feedback. It is refreshing and appreciate [sic] and if \nyou know anything about me it is that I will comply and adjust fire \n(emphasis added). There are greater issues at hand though that will be \n                                                          \n3 Tr1. 6; Tr2. 6; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr2. 144-147; GE 3 (personal subject interview (PSI), October 24, 2016). \n \n5 Under this type of contract with the AF, GC1 employees and AF government employees (military and \ncivilian) worked side by side. The AF was the customer of GC1. While Applicant\u2019s direct boss was the PM \nworking for GC1, the customer\u2019s input was always considered. This explains why the CR, an AF \nemployee, would be directing Applicant\u2019s actions in this instance. \n\n \n4 \n \n \naddressed in the immediate future, you will be kept in the loop. Thanks \nagain. \n \nTen minutes later the CR sent Applicant a two word reply stating, \u201cCopy all.\u201d This \nphrase commonly means message received. Applicant\u2019s PM testified that he knew \nApplicant and the CR met and talked after this email exchange, but he was not present. \nThereafter, the following email exchange took place. First from Applicant to the CR at \n5:00 pm: \n \nThanks so much for the conversation this afternoon regarding the series of \nemail, again I apologize for providing a confusing response that clearly did \nnot covey [sic] the message I intended it to. I value your candid tone, and \nwill comply with your recommendations. \n \nThe CR responded to this email from Applicant at 5:02 stating: \n \nNot an issue [Applicant]. Please continue to communicate clearly and \ncontinuously as u [sic] did in our conversation and with different elements \nof your surroundings and all will stay peachey [sic].6   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer explained that his use of the \u201ccomply and adjust fire\u201d \ncomment was simply stating in commonly understood and commonly used military \nlanguage that he would comply and adjust his course of action in reference to his work \nhours. He also testified that his comment was taken out of context. Applicant\u2019s PM \ntestified that he was \u201calarmed\u201d by Applicant\u2019s email using this comment. He admitted he \nwas not alarmed by the comment itself, but based upon his knowledge of Applicant (he \nhad supervised Applicant from June 2015 to August 2016), the PM felt there was an \nunderlying menacing element of the email directed toward the CR. He believed it was \nan implied threat. The PM met with Applicant after the emails on June 9, 2016, for the \npurpose of reiterating that Applicant had to stick to his established work schedule \nwithout deviation, unless so authorized. He claims he documented this discussion with \nApplicant, but no documentation was produced for the hearing. No disciplinary action \nwas taken against Applicant at that time for the email comment.7   \n \n \nAugust 16, 2016 Comment. The factual basis for this allegation was also from \nthe security manager\u2019s JPAS report. On this date Applicant, his PM, and a \nrepresentative from Human Resources (HR) met (HR joined the meeting via telephonic \ncontact) and Applicant was issued a Disciplinary Notice (Formal Warning). The Notice \nwas issued to address Applicant\u2019s work schedule and management\u2019s concern that he \nwas not complying with previously issued instructions. After he was issued the Notice, \nApplicant was allowed to provide comments in the body of the letter, which he did. His \ncomments were as follows: \n                                                          \n6 Tr2. 31, 82; GE 2; AE A. \n \n7 Tr1. 38; Tr2. 30-31, 35-36, 38-39, 76-77; AE A; SOR Answer. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe context and representation of events is heavily bias [sic] to one side. \nWhile I will comply entirely with the recommendations and action of this \n\u201cDisciplinary Notice,\u201d I have an entirely different perspective that brings to \nlight the motivation behind these events. The retaliation [emphasis \nadded] and level of harassment endured by me is being documented and \nsubstantiated with support from to [sic] leaders in the organization I \nsupport.8 \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant explained that the use of the word \u201cretaliation\u201d \nreferred to his belief that he was being retaliated against because he made \nwhistleblower complaints (see discussion below on whistleblowing allegation) against \ntwo AF employees (GS1 and GS2) for time-card abuse. He did not mean that he was \ngoing to retaliate against anyone. Applicant\u2019s PM testified that other than Applicant \nreferencing \u201cretaliation\u201d in his comment to the Disciplinary Notice, there was no other \nreference to retaliation. The PM knew that Applicant was using this in the context of his \nperceived whistleblower activity and he knew the comment was not a threat.9    \n \n \nAugust 17, 2016 Comment. The factual basis for this allegation was also from \nthe security manager\u2019s JPAS report. On this date another meeting was held with \nApplicant, his PM, and HR (participating through a video teleconference). The purpose \nof this meeting was to discuss Applicant\u2019s allegation that he faced reprisal because of \nhis whistleblower activities. The subject came up at the meeting held the day before, but \nHR wanted this topic deferred and discussed separately. During the meeting, Applicant \nstated his belief that the recent complaints about his work hours and adhering to his \nwork schedule were coming from GS1 and GS2 and were in reprisal for his reporting \ntheir timecard abuse several months before. HR indicated the allegations would be \ninvestigated. While Applicant and his PM were leaving the room, both describe a \nconversation they had in very different ways. Applicant stated in his SOR Answer and \nduring his testimony that the statement he made, \u201cmisquoting me right now is \ndangerous,\u201d was referring to it being dangerous for the Applicant. His testimony \nexplained his meaning as follows: \n \nSo, after I walked out, [PM] had said that I made a comment \u201cI have legal \ncounsel in waiting,\u201d which was not a true statement. And I told him \nmisquoting me is dangerous right now because this is going to come back \nand harm me if you report stuff like that. That\u2019s the context that that was \ngiven in, and it was a very polite, respectful conversation. \n \nThe PM testified that he felt the words \u201cmisquoting me right now is dangerous\u201d were a \ndirect threat towards him at that moment based upon Applicant\u2019s body language and \n                                                          \n8 Tr2. 82; GE 2; AE B. \n \n9 Tr1. 50-52; Tr2. 78-79; SOR Answer. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \noverall demeanor. He described Applicant\u2019s as having clenched fists and he believed \nApplicant was trying to stare him down and intimidate him.10  \n \n \nThe PM testified that after leaving the meeting with Applicant he went back to his \noffice and thought about what just transpired. He called his Chief Operating Officer \n(COO) and told him that Applicant had just threatened him and that he was \u201cover this\u201d \nand that he \u201cdid not have to put up with this.\u201d He wanted to fire Applicant. The COO \nagreed with the PM, and with HR coordination the decision was made to fire Applicant \nthe next day, August 18, 2016. The PM stated he memorialized his conversation with \nthe COO in an email, but that email was not offered into evidence. The PM told the AF, \nthrough the CR, of the decision to terminate Applicant. Later that evening, the PM \nreceived a call from the AF colonel in charge. They discussed implementation of the \nplan to notify and terminate Applicant the next day.11 \n \n \nAugust 18, 2016 Comment. The factual basis for this allegation was also from \nthe security manager\u2019s JPAS report. On this day the PM received a call from the AF \ncolonel that an employee reported that Applicant was behaving erratically at his work \nsite (erratic behavior was not explained) and that he made a strange comment to the \neffect, \u201cprepare to go to war in five minutes.\u201d There is no evidence showing that an \ninvestigation was conducted or that witnesses to the alleged event were interviewed. \nThe AF Colonel wanted the timing of Applicant\u2019s termination moved up. At this point, \nApplicant had not been notified of his impending termination. With this new information, \nthe PM called his COO and discussed moving up the time they would notify Applicant. \nThey made the decision to do it immediately rather than wait until the afternoon as \noriginally planned. The PM met with Applicant and told him he was terminated and to \nturn over his base access cards. Applicant complied and asked the reason for the \ntermination. The PM told him he would receive a formal letter in the following days. The \nfollow-up termination letter was not offered into evidence. Applicant complied with the \ninstructions, was escorted to his car, and peacefully left the area.12   \n \n \nThe PM testified that he did not know who the employee was that notified the \ncolonel about Applicant\u2019s behavior and statement that day. He never did find out who \nreported this information. He memorialized the day\u2019s actions in a memo he sent to HR \nthe same day.13  \n \n \nApplicant explained a different context for the \u201cprepare to go to war\u201d comment. In \nhis SOR Answer he stated that he made the comment in reference to the action of the \ncleaning woman who came through his work section. He claimed that the cleaning \nwoman was clumsy, often knocked things off desks, tangled up the vacuum cord, ran \n                                                          \n10 Tr1. 54-55; Tr2. 54-58, 79-80; SOR Answer. \n11 Tr2. 59-63; GE 4. \n \n12 Tr2. 64-66, 70-71; GE 2, 4. \n \n13 Tr2. 67, 71; GE 4. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninto people, and was generally chaotic when she worked the area. This led Applicant \nand others to note her impeding arrival by saying words to the effect, \u201cprepare for battle, \nshe will be here in five minutes.\u201d Applicant reiterated this context during his testimony \nand added that all these comments were said with a degree of levity as an inside joke \namongst coworkers. He believes the employee who reported him was GS1.14  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Claim of Whistleblower Reprisal. Applicant claims that the \ncomplaints about his comments and his termination were the result of reprisal by GS1 \nand GS2 because he reported time-card abuse and they were both disciplined as a \nresult. GS1 was an AF employee whose duties were parallel to Applicant\u2019s duties on the \ncontractor side. GS2 was GS1\u2019s supervisor and was responsible for monitoring GS1\u2019s \ntime-card activities. Applicant believed GS1 and GS 2 were friends. He claims that he \nnoticed GS1, who was the time keeper for that duty section, was not properly \naccounting for her time. In March 2016, he notified GS1\u2019s branch chief about the \npossible fraud and was told his anonymity would be protected. Applicant claimed that \nthe next day he was treated differently by both GS1 and GS2. He believed they became \nrude and belligerent in their conversations with him. He also believed that GS2 was \nresponsible for demanding that Applicant change his work schedule to one that was \nless flexible for him. Applicant also claims that both GS1 and GS2 were disciplined for \ntheir actions regarding time-card fraud. He believed they were counseled by the division \ndeputy (a GS-15 employee) and their schedules were adjusted. There was no \ndocumentation corroborating Applicant\u2019s version of these events (other than his own \nnotes, which he provided after his first hearing). He claimed he could provide supporting \nwitness statements, but he did not.15 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s PM testified that his knowledge that complaints were made against \nGS1 and GS2 for time card abuse came from Applicant. He does not know if they were \ndisciplined for it. He knew GS1, but he had never met GS 2. He first became aware of \nApplicant\u2019s reprisal concerns on June 9, 2016. He never received any complaints from \nGS1 or GS2 about Applicant. The PM testified that the several discussions (from 4 to 6) \nhe had with Applicant before August 2016 were strictly about him adhering to his \nestablished work schedule. He gave examples of when Applicant altered the schedule \non his own without permission.16  \n \n \nCharacter Evidence. A witness (W1) who has known Applicant for 15 years \ntestified for him at both hearings. He hired Applicant to work for GC2 in January 2015 \nand was his supervisor. Applicant was in the same job position then as he would be \nlater when working for GC1. W1 never received any complaints about Applicant. He \nstated that the division deputy for GC1 loved his work. After Applicant was fired in \nAugust 2016, he came to work at GC3 where W1 was then working, which is also \n                                                          \n14 Tr1. 56-60, 69; SOR Answer \n \n15 Tr1. 22-24, 39-40, 42; GE 3; App. Post-Hearing1 Exh.

W1 has never known Applicant to become violent towards \na coworker or do anything in the workplace that would cause a safety concern for other \nemployees. He is aware of the allegations against Applicant. He recommends granting \nof his clearance because he believes Applicant presents no security risk based upon his \noverall good character.17  \n \n \nA second witness (W2) testified at Applicant\u2019s remand hearing. He has known \nApplicant for two to three years. He hired Applicant to work for GC3 located on the \nsame Air Force Base as where GC1 was located. Applicant worked there until losing his \nclearance. W2 testified that he knew about Applicant\u2019s firing at GC1. Applicant told him \nabout it and W2 talked to several people working for GS1, including the division deputy \nabout Applicant. He hired Applicant with full knowledge of the events that took place at \nGC1. W2 said the division deputy at GC1 spoke highly of Applicant and wished he was \nstill there. While working for GC3, Applicant was an outstanding employee. W2 wanted \nto promote him. W2 would hire him back if he gained his clearance. W2 received no \ncomplaints about Applicant concerning his behavior or allegations of verbal abuse \ntoward other employees. He recommends that Applicant be granted a clearance.18 \n \n \nApplicant offered letters of support from his former division deputy and two \ncoworkers at GS1. The division deputy stated Applicant worked for her as an \nadministrative specialist and that he was reliable and honest. She believes he is a man \nof \u201cvalor and dedicated to our country.\u201d She opined that he is \u201cworthy of a security \nclearance . . . .\u201d His two coworkers from GC1 worked with him on a daily basis. They \nfound him to be trustworthy and honest. They were both aware of the difficult \ncircumstances Applicant faced in dealing with his work environment. Even with those \nchallenges, both coworkers stated that Applicant remained dedicated to his job and was \nprofessional. Both recommend that he be granted a clearance.19  \n \n \nApplicant also offered letters of support from his most recent supervisor at GC3 \nand two coworkers from there. His supervisor described Applicant as \u201cextremely reliable \nand forthright\u201d and that \u201c[h]e has a passion for doing the right thing first.\u201d Applicant\u2019s two \ncoworkers describe him as a dedicated, hardworking man of integrity. He was known for \nhis respectful, cordial, and approachable interactions with coworkers and supervisors. \nOne coworker who worked with Applicant for 18 months stated: \u201cHe has always handled \nhimself in a very professional and courteous manner in all matters of business dealings, \npersonal conversations and interactions at all times.\u201d20 \n \n \n                                                          \n17 Tr1. 78-79, 83-86; Tr2 118-120, 122-123, 125-126. \n \n18 Tr2. 130-140. \n \n19 AE C; RAE A. \n \n20 AE C. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nThe allegations in the SOR consist of four statements by Applicant and a fifth \nallegation stating he was terminated as a result of the his statements and related action. \nThe fifth allegation is a consequence of the four previous allegations and does not, on \nits own, provide a basis for disqualification. Applicant\u2019s email using the phase \u201ccomply \nand adjust fire\u201d in the context of how it was used does not support a basis for \ndisqualification. The evidence indicates Applicant\u2019s use of \u201cretaliation\u201d in his reply to the \nDisciplinary Notice was in the context of his reference to his whistleblowing activities \nand not as a threat to others. The evidence does not establish that his use of the term \namounted to disruptive, violent, or inappropriate behavior, or that it established a pattern \n\n \n11 \n \n \nof rule violations. Concerning Applicant\u2019s comment \u201cmisquoting me now is dangerous,\u201d \nthe evidence is equivocal. Clearly the PM believed the comment was an implied threat \nto him. Applicant, on the other hand, provided a context for the statement which takes it \nout of the realm of a threat, but at best puts it as an ill-advised statement at the time. \nApplying the substantial evidence standard, this statement amounted to inappropriate \nbehavior by the Applicant. AG 16(d)(2) applies to this allegation. I find that the evidence \nis insufficient to establish a disqualifying condition related to Applicant\u2019s statement of \n\u201cprepare to go to war in five minutes.\u201d The Government\u2019s evidence is based upon an \nunknown declarant who apparently made the report to some level of supervision which \nfound its way to Applicant\u2019s PM. No investigation was conducted and no corroborating \nwitnesses were offered. The PM never found out who made the statement. Applicant \ntestified about the statement and the context in which it was made, which was \nunrefuted. His explanation, in proper context, makes his statement benign and does not \namount to inappropriate conduct or any type of rules violation.  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and   \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant\u2019s statement (SOR \u00b61.c) to the PM occurred in August 2016. Since that \ntime, Applicant was hired by another government contractor (GC3) at the same location \nwithout any similar incidents occurring. His recent supervisor and coworkers specifically \nnoted that Applicant is a great employee. Even his former coworkers noted that he was \ndealing with a difficult situation when he worked at GC1. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies.  Although, I \ndetermined that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d were not established by the evidence, I also \nfind that they would be mitigated under 17(c). Likewise, AG \u00b6 17(f) applies to SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. \nWhistleblower Reprisal Issue \n \nContractor employees are protected from reprisal for reporting any DOD gross \nwaste of funds, or a violation of law, rule regulation related to a DOD contract.21 \nApplicant claims he reported time card abuse or fraud by a DOD employee (GS1) and \nthat as a result GS1 and GS2, her supervisor, were disciplined. He further claims that \nbecause he made these disclosures and the employees were disciplined, they set out to \nretaliate against him by complaining to the PM and by treating him differently after his \n                                                          \n21 See 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409; 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3341 \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \ndisclosure. The evidence is sufficient to support that Applicant made protected \ndisclosures. The PM gave evidence, through his testimony and his written memos, \nestablishing the basis for his actions against Applicant. According to the PM, he acted \nbecause Applicant was not following the directive to maintain a fixed working schedule. \nNone of his actions were because Applicant made a protected disclosure. The evidence \nis sufficient to support that actions taken against Applicant were not done based upon \nhis protected disclosures. There was no reprisal against Applicant based upon his \nprotected activities.   \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.               \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, his VA disability, his supervisors\u2019 statements, particularly the statement from his \nformer division deputy from GC1 and his supervisor from GC3, as well as the statement \nfrom coworkers from both GC1 and GC3. I also considered the time elapsed since his \ndifficulties working at GC1 and the lack of evidence of any similar situations. Applicant \nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude the security concerns under the Guideline E, personal conduct, were either \nnot established or were mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs     1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

His history of financial problems was due, in part, to \ncircumstances largely beyond his control; namely, a difficult relationship with a \ncohabitant, a dispute over their daughter, and a change of jobs and resulting decline in \nincome so he could be near his daughter. He has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by resolving nearly all of the delinquent debt at issue, and he is disputing \na collection account stemming from an apartment lease. He also fixed his tax problems \nand is in compliance with both state and federal tax authorities. Accordingly, this case is \ndecided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non September 14, 2014. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on April 24, 2018, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \n\n \n2 \n \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 4, 2018. He admitted the SOR allegations \nexcept for a $912 collection account, which he disputes, and two minor medical \ncollection accounts. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on August 20, 2018, and then \nreassigned to me on October 2, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on October \n12, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Both Department Counsel and Applicant \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4 and A-L, \nrespectively. No witnesses other than Applicant were called.  \n \nThe record was kept open until October 31, 2018, to allow Applicant an \nopportunity to provide additional documentary evidence. He made a timely submission, \nand the post-hearing matters are admitted without objections as Exhibits M-U.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He is employed as a technician who installs and repairs security systems at \noverseas locations. He has been so employed in Afghanistan since July 2016. He has \nhad multiple overseas job locations with the same employer since he began working for \nthem in mid-2014. His formal education includes a high school diploma and some \ncollege. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps during 1995-1999 and \nreceived an honorable discharge. He married recently in July 2018, and he has three \nstepchildren from his marriage. (Tr. 69-71) He also has a 12-year-old daughter from a \nprevious relationship to whom he pays child support and provides health insurance. He \nis now a resident of a state that does not impose an income tax.   \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant has a history of financial problems, \nwhich he does not dispute. The SOR concerns the following matters: (1) five delinquent \naccounts, charged off or in collection, ranging in amounts from $164 to $5,966 for a total \nof about $10,321; (2) failure to timely file income tax returns in the state of Virginia for \ntax year 2012 and failure to timely pay income tax for the same year; (3) failure to timely \nfile income tax returns in the state of Oklahoma for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014; and \n(4) failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 and \nfailure to timely pay income tax for those years. Except for the $912 collection account \nhe is disputing and a $271 medical collection account, Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations in his answer to the SOR or during his hearing testimony or both. Additional \nevidence establishing the SOR allegations is found in the documentary evidence.   \n \nApplicant attributed his history of financial problems to a difficult relationship with \na cohabitant during 2006-2009, which ended in separation in June 2009, and the \n\n \n3 \n \nresulting dispute over visitation with and custody of their daughter. He explained at \nlength that his cohabitant was financially irresponsible, failed to pay bills on a timely \nbasis, and overspent during their relationship. For example, he stated that she wrote 40 \nbad checks in less than a year and failed to pay for daycare while he was working in \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 35-36) After the separation in 2009, Applicant stopped working \noverseas and took a job where he could live near his daughter and be involved with her. \nAs a result, he earned less money. In 2012, he brought an action in family court, which \nwas unsuccessful. At that point he decided he could no longer afford to live in a high-\ncost of living area along with paying child support and meet his other financial \nobligations. He moved to Oklahoma in mid-2012 for a job as a junior field engineer in \nthe energy industry. He lived about half of 2012 in Virginia and half in Oklahoma, which \nis the basis for the requirement to file two state income tax returns for tax year 2012. He \nworked in Oklahoma for about two years until June 2014, when he decided to leave the \nenergy industry and resumed working overseas as a technician, which is more lucrative.  \n \nTaken together, the circumstances noted above put Applicant in a financial hole \nand created some chaos in his financial affairs. He described it as a \u201cmess.\u201d (Tr. 35) \nAfter departing Oklahoma and returning to working overseas, he became more \nfinancially stable and was able to begin the process of putting his financial house in \ngood order. For example, he filed the past-due federal income tax returns for 2012 and \n2013 in mid-2015.  \n \nAddressing the five delinquent accounts first, the charged-off account for $5,966 \nstems from a deficiency balance on an automobile loan obtained from a credit union. \n(Tr. 49-50; Exhibits B and M) The vehicle was repossessed in August 2013. The \nbalance due was adjusted to $4,733, and Applicant made a series of payments during \nAugust and September 2018. The debt was paid in full on September 28, 2018. \n \nThe charged-off account for $3,008 stems from a line of credit obtained from a \ncredit union. (Tr. 50-51; Exhibit N). The debt was settled in full as of May 11, 2018.  \n \nThe $912 collection account stems from an apartment lease Applicant had when \nhe was living in Oklahoma. (Tr. 51-54; Exhibit L) He explained at length that he did not \nbreak the lease and left the apartment in good order. He challenged the $912 bill when \nhe received it from the landlord, but they refused to provide the basis for the bill and \nwould not deal with him. He hired an attorney in January 2014 who formally disputed \nthe bill with the landlord. No response was received from the attorney\u2019s demand letter. \n \nThe $271 medical collection account is a mystery to Applicant. (Tr. 54-55; Exhibit \n4) He had no information on the account and was unable to verify the account. While \nthe debt is reflected in an October 2017 credit report, it was not reflected in the most \nrecent credit report in the Government\u2019s possession. (Tr. 55) Given these \ncircumstances, I find that this debt is no longer a concern.  \n \nThe $164 medical collection account stems from a medical visit or appointment in \nOklahoma. (Tr. 54-55; Exhibit A). The bill, after payment by insurance, was sent to an \n\n \n4 \n \naddress he had since departed. He was able to verify the account and paid it off with a \n$170 payment in August 2018.   \n \nTurning to the tax problems, Applicant presented extensive documentation to \nestablish that he is now in compliance with state and federal tax authorities, has filed all \nthe required returns, and does not owe back taxes. (Exhibits C-K and O-S) As noted \nabove, Applicant filed the past-due federal returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 in mid-\n2015. He self-prepared the returns with the aid of TurboTax. (Exhibit P) For tax year \n2012, the IRS account transcript shows an extension was granted to October 15, 2013; \nthe return was filed on June 12, 2015; penalties for late filing and late payment of tax \nwere assessed; a $3,844 credit was transferred in from tax year 2015; and the balance \nwas $0 as of May 2016. (Exhibit C) Likewise, for tax year 2013, the IRS account \ntranscript shows the return was filed on July 13, 2015; penalties for late filing and late \npayment of tax were accessed; a $1,310 payment was made with the return; and the \nbalance was less than $1 and written-off as of September 14, 2015, the effect of which \nis a $0 balance. (Exhibit D) In addition to the tax years at issue, IRS transcripts for tax \nyears 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, show that Applicant timely filed returns and has $0 \nbalances. (Exhibits E, F, G, and H) \n \nMore recently in April-May 2018, after the SOR was issued in this case, Applicant \nretained the services of a CPA in Oklahoma to review his tax returns. (Tr. 60) As a \nresult, federal returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 were filed in May 2018. (Exhibit O) \nThese returns are not reflected in the IRS account transcripts mentioned above, which \nwere issued on July 30, 2018.   \n \nTurning next to the Oklahoma tax matters, Applicant filed returns for tax years \n2012, 2013, and 2014 in approximately March 2015, which means the 2014 return was \ntimely filed. (Exhibits P and Q) He self-prepared the returns with the aid of TurboTax. \nHe filed as an Oklahoma nonresident/part-year taxpayer for tax years 2012 and 2014. \nHe was due refunds of $95 and $53 for tax years 2012 and 2013. He owed a balance of \n$9 for tax year 2014. As with the federal returns in April-May 2018, Applicant tasked the \nOklahoma CPA to review his Oklahoma tax returns. (Exhibit O) Returns were filed in \nMay 2018 reflecting a $17 refund for tax year 2012, a $53 refund for tax year 2013, and \na balance due of $1,044 for tax year 2014. He subsequently contacted the Oklahoma \ntax authority and was told that he owed $19. (Tr. 61) He paid that amount through the \nstate\u2019s online system. (Exhibit K) \n \nTurning last to the Virginia tax matters, the 2012 tax return was not filed until May \n2018, as it was also prepared by the Oklahoma CPA in April-May 2018. (Exhibit O) \nApplicant conceded that he did not have a good answer why the 2012 return was filed \nso late, he lost track of it while addressing other matters, and receipt of the SOR in April \n2018 got his attention. The May 2018 Virginia return reflects an amount owed of $3,279. \nHe made a payment of $550 in July 2018. (Exhibit I) Upon his return to Afghanistan \nafter the hearing, he received a notice of assessment from the Virginia tax authority for \na total amount owed of $5,349. (Exhibits R and S) Applicant believed it was mistaken \ndue to using his combined income from both Virginia and Oklahoma, as he was a part-\nyear resident of Virginia in 2012. He attempted to contact his Oklahoma CPA several \n\n \n5 \n \ntimes. After not receiving a timely response, he retained the services of a Virginia CPA \nin mid-October 2018. (Exhibit T) An amended return for tax year 2012 was filed on \nOctober 31, 2018, and it reflects a small refund and no further tax owed. (Exhibit U)   \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s current financial situation appears to be stable. He earns an \nannual gross income of about $140,000. (Tr. 58) He pays $744 monthly for child \nsupport and about $235 in health insurance for his minor daughter, and he is current \nwith his payments. (Tr. 58-59) He has a 401(k) account with his current employer with a \nbalance of about $17,185. (Tr. 81) He has a brokerage account with a balance of about \n$15,000. (Tr. 82) He has a savings account with a balance of about $11,000, and he \nhas a checking account with a balance of about $1,100. (Tr. 83) He traveled from \nAfghanistan at his own expense for the hearing in this case.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n\n \n6 \n \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n                                                          \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s problematic financial history is traceable to a difficult relationship with \na cohabitant during 2006-2009, when they separated that year in June. The separation \nwas largely due to the cohabitant\u2019s financial irresponsibility, failure to pay bills on time, \nand overspending. They fought over visitation with and custody of his daughter, and he \nchanged jobs and worked for less money so he could be near his daughter during 2009-\n2012. He attempted a career change to the energy industry during 2012-2014 until \ndeciding to return his previous employment working overseas for more money. Many of \nthose circumstances were largely beyond his control. Moreover, his motive in making \nthose changes was, he believed, in the best interests of his daughter.  \n \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. He resolved nearly all \nof the delinquent debt at issue, and he is disputing a collection account stemming from \nan apartment lease. He also fixed his tax problems and is in compliance with both state \nand federal tax authorities, although he could have acted more promptly, especially with \nthe state of Virginia. He is now in a much stronger financial position, meaning that it is \nunlikely that a similar problem will recur. By way of example, I note that he has timely \nfiled federal income tax returns since 2014.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 14, 2010, and again on June 9, 2016, Applicant applied for a national \nsecurity position, essentially a public trust position, and submitted Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On December 18, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was \nunable to make an affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to \nsupport a contract with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated January 22, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 23, 2018. The case was \nassigned to me on January 10, 2019. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 13, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for April 3, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5 and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE F were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 15, 2019. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE G through AE W, \nwithout objection. The record closed on May 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations \npertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.o.), as well as \nthe sole allegation pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a financial technician (travel auditor) with his current employer since April 2019, after \nserving in a different position as a clerk with the same employer since July 2016. A 1983 \nhigh school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, and earned a \nnumber of additional credits towards a higher degree. He served on active duty as an \ninfantry officer with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) from August 1992 until June 1998, \nwhen he accepted a regular commission, and continued serving with the USMC until he \nresigned his commission and received an honorable discharge as a major in June 2000. \nHe was granted a secret clearance in 1994, and has been occupying a position of public \ntrust since 2016. Applicant was married in 2000, and he has been separated since 2010, \nwith an intention of divorcing, once he has the money to do so. He has one child, born in \n2004. \n \nMilitary Record \n \n \nDuring his military career, Applicant was deployed overseas to Kuwait, Korea, \nJapan, and Somalia, and while in the United States, was involved in counterdrug \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \noperations. He was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, a Certificate of \nAppreciation, the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, the Armed Forces Expeditionary \nMedal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Meritorious Unit \nCommendation, and the Marine Corps Recruiting Ribbon.1  \n \nFinancial Considerations2 \n  \nAs noted above, after the hearing was conducted, Applicant accepted another \nposition from his employer, with an immediate increase of his annual salary, as well as \novertime.3 However, before his recent string of favorable employment experiences, he \nwent through a series of unemployment periods commencing in August 2008, during the \nnational housing crisis and plummeting national economy. He had previously been hired \nas a pharmaceutical sales specialist in April 2004, and when his mentor left the company \nfor a competitor, Applicant joined his mentor in May 2007. Because he was unable to sell \nhis residence in one city, he could not afford to maintain two mortgages. His new \nemployer had a policy that mandated that he reside fulltime within his designated \ngeographical territory within six months of being hired. Recognizing the difficulties, \nApplicant\u2019s district manager extended him an extra 12 months to move. However, senior \nmanagement refused to permit an additional extension, and Applicant was terminated in \nAugust 2008.4  \nAlthough he sought employment in his field in entry-level positions in multiple \nlocations, he was unsuccessful because he was deemed overqualified and because he \nhad previously made too much salary. Applicant was eventually able to gain a variety of \nfull-time and part-time seasonal positions starting in February 2010, but he went through \nadditional layoffs and unemployment from August 2010 until October 2013; July 2014 \nuntil January 2015; and July 2015 until March 2016.5 \nApplicant\u2019s savings were eventually depleted, and some accounts became \ndelinquent. At least one account was charged off. The SOR identified 15 purportedly \ndelinquent accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, as generally \nreflected by Applicant\u2019s June 2016 or October 2017 credit reports. Those debts total \napproximately $45,544. The current status of those accounts is as follows: \n                                                          \n1 AE H (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated June 3, 1998); \nAE I (DD Form 214, dated June 15, 2000); AE J (List of Deployments, undated); AE L (Award List, undated). \n \n2 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated June 23, \n2016); GE 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated October 19, 2017); GE 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nJuly 19, 2017); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated January 22, 2018.   \n  \n3 AE G (Comments, undated); AE Q (Official Job Offer E-mail, dated April 24, 2019). \n \n4 GE 2 (E-QIP, dated June 9, 2016, at 10-18); GE 3, supra note 2, at 4. \n \n5 GE 2, supra note 4, at 10-18; GE 3, supra note 2, at 4. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a home mortgage with a high credit of $180,000 and a past-\ndue balance of $5,164, which was placed for collection after Applicant\u2019s June 2016 credit \nreport was issued.6 The account was actually current until mid-2016, when Applicant\u2019s \nwife was involved in an automobile accident. It occurred during a transition period when \nApplicant was between employers and health coverages, leaving him fully responsible for \nthe unanticipated approximately $6,000 in medical payments and vehicle repair costs. He \neventually managed to substantially reduce the delinquency, but a natural disaster \u2013 \ncalled Hurricane Michael \u2013 occurred in October 2018, leaving him further behind. That \nhurricane was the first category 5 hurricane to strike the contiguous United States since \n1992. Applicant had previously been granted annual leave, and, as an hourly employee \nrather than a salaried employee, he was required to take the leave although the facility \nhad shut down. Because of his reduced income caused by the shutdown, Applicant did \nnot have sufficient funds to make his monthly mortgage payment. He managed to make \nmultiple monthly payments in early 2019 in an effort to catch up, and as of April 3, 2019, \nhe was only two months behind. His parents became aware of his situation, and they \nwere scheduled to make his April payment, an action that would bring his mortgage to \nonly one month delinquent, and Applicant planned to make his May payment on the due \ndate to bring it back into a current status.7 The account has either been resolved or is the \nprocess of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is a bank-issued credit-card account with a $16,659 credit limit \nthat was placed for collection and a disputed amount was reported to have been charged \noff in June 2012. Applicant\u2019s June 2016 credit report stated that $16,659 was charged off, \nbut his October 2017 credit report seems to indicate that there was a past due balance \nof $10,320 and an unpaid balance of $14,609.8 In 2014, approximately three years before \nthe SOR was issued, Applicant entered into a repayment arrangement with the creditor\u2019s \ncollection agent under which he agreed to make monthly $50 payments commencing on \nJanuary 31, 2014. He continued to make his payments in compliance with those \narrangements through October 2018, when the creditor withdrew the account from the \ncollection agent, eventually reducing the unpaid balance from $16,659.91 to $13,909.91.9 \nApplicant contends that the creditor informed him in May 2019, that it anticipates issuing \nhim a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, in the amount of $13,901.91,10 but he failed to \nsubmit any documents to support his contention. Notwithstanding the absence of such \nsupporting documentation, it appears that the account is in the process of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.e.): These are three bank-issued credit-card accounts from \nthe same bank with reported unpaid and past-due balances of $12,165, $6,986, and \n                                                          \n6 GE 4, supra note 2, at 8; GE 5, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n7 Tr. at 25-32; AE S (Memo, dated May 2, 2019); AE R (Statement, undated); AE U (Account Detail, \nundated); AE T (Mortgage Statements, various dates). \n \n8 GE 4, supra note 2, at 6; GE 5, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n9 AE V (Account Payment History Report, dated May 1, 2019); Tr. at 32-33. \n \n10 AE R, supra note 7. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n$3,127 that were placed for collection.11 Applicant was not aware that his wife had \nstopped making the monthly payments on the accounts because she was handling the \nbills and never told him about the delinquencies. When he found out about the \ndelinquencies and questioned her, she denied knowing that they were in collection.12 The \ncreditor issued Applicant three Form 1099-Cs, cancelling the three debts: on May 3, 2014, \ncancelling the debt for $5,404.40 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.); on November 15, 2014, cancelling the \ndebt for $10,900.63 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.); and on December 31, 2015, cancelling the debt for \n$3,054.02 (SOR \u00b6 1.e.).13 While the two older Form 1099-Cs were to be applied to \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 income, and the most recent one was to be applied to his 2015 income, \nApplicant seemingly amended his earlier filings and added all three to his federal income \ntax return for the tax year 2014, which he filed in March 2018.14 Because his withheld \nincome tax, earned income credit, and child tax credit were more than his total tax, \nincluding the income from the cancelled debts, Applicant anticipated a tax refund.15 Those \naccounts have been resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.n., and 1.o.): These are eight medical debts, \ntotaling $3,063, purportedly generated in 2013 by unidentified medical providers with \nunpaid balances of $1,211, $588, $420, $389, $274, $130, $31, and $31 that were placed \nfor collection, as reported solely by Equifax (with one exception regarding an account \nreported also by TransUnion) in Applicant\u2019s June 2016 credit report.16 None of these \ndebts are reported in Applicant\u2019s October 2017 Equifax credit report. Although he \n\u201cverified\u201d the information pertaining to the accounts during his interview with an \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in July 2017, in fact, \nhe was under the impression those debts were related to his May 2016 accident and \nresulting injuries while at work. Moreover, when asked about each particular account, \nApplicant had no specific information to discuss because the charges should have been \nhandled by his workers compensation claim.17 Applicant contacted both the hospital and \nthe billing department of the medical group that he thought had generated the bills, but \nthey had no record of any outstanding accounts in his name. He contacted Equifax, but \nit too had no such information.18  \nDuring the hearing, because he was unable to obtain any information regarding \nthe accounts, he stated that they might be related to his wife\u2019s June 2016 accident.19 \n                                                          \n11 GE 4, supra note 2, at 6-7. \n \n \n12 Tr. at 38-40. \n \n13 AE A (Forms 1099-C, various dates). \n \n14 AE W (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return \u2013 2014 (Form 1040), dated March 31, 2018). \n \n15 AE W, supra note 14, at 2. \n \n16 GE 4, supra note 2, at 12-13. \n \n17 GE 3, supra note 2, at 4-9. \n \n18 AE R, supra note 7. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife managed to locate two explanations of benefits (one for herself and one \nfor their son) which indicated that the charges related to a June 9, 2016 incident were, for \nsome unexplained reason, sent directly to Medicaid rather than to the primary insurance \ncompany. Neither bill was in an amount listed in the credit report or in the SOR.20 The \nAppeal Board previously explained:21 \n  \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply.  \nIn attempting to meet his burden, Applicant contacted the credit reporting agency, \nthe hospital, the billing department of his medical group, and the only identified collection \nagent. His wife contacted the insurance companies and potential medical providers. No \nrelevant information pertaining to 2013 medical charges was furnished to them. Since the \nidentities of the unidentified creditors have not been reported to Applicant, despite his \nbeing motivated and able to resolve these purported debts, it is impossible for him to take \nfurther action. While it is not dispositive of the allegations, it is significant that neither \nExperian nor TransUnion (with the one exception) reported the accounts in Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2016 credit report, and Equifax, after reporting them in that credit report, did not \nreport the accounts in the October 2017 credit report.  \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. and 1.m.): These are two medical debts, totaling $519, purportedly \ngenerated in 2014 by unidentified medical providers with unpaid balances of $389 and \n$130 that were placed for collection, with one reported by Equifax and TransUnion, and \none reported solely by Equifax in Applicant\u2019s June 2016 credit report.22 Applicant and his \nwife took the actions described above regarding the 2013 medical accounts, with the \nsame results. \nOther than the accounts alleged in the SOR, there is no evidence of any other \ndelinquent accounts. During the hearing, Applicant indicated that in the past, he had \nearned six-figure salaries and bonuses, and that became a major issue in his inability to \nobtain employment over the ensuing years.23 During the tax year 2018, Applicant\u2019s \nincome was $32,236.49.24 As noted above, on April 24, 2019, Applicant received an \nofficial job offer for a civil-service positions with a salary, including locality pay, of $37,843, \n                                                          \n19 Tr. at 41. \n \n20 AE B (E-mail, dated March 26, 2019, with attached explanations of benefits). \n \n21 ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd.

Some of those questions \nasked if, in the past seven years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; \nand had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay \nas agreed. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions, and certified that his responses \nwere \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief.26 In fact, his \nanswers were incorrect, for Applicant actually had several delinquent accounts that \nclearly came within the scope of the questions asked.  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had deliberately falsified the \nmaterial facts in his responses to the e-QIP inquiries, although during the hearing he \nmodified that admission by claiming that he did not purposely try to deceive, and did not \nknow why he had answered as he had.27 He claimed that he had used his 2010 e-QIP for \nmost of his entries, and noted that in that 2010 e-QIP, he answered the same questions \nwith a \u201cyes.\u201d He reiterated that it was not his intention to deceive.28 \n \nWork Performance and Character References \n  \n \nSeveral individuals have known Applicant for over 30 years. One former senior \nnon-commissioned officer \u2013 a member of a special forces group, and now with the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security \u2013 has had years of interaction with Applicant when he \nwas an infantry officer and a recruiter. He is aware that Applicant holds on to the traditions \nand codes of conduct. He does not believe that Applicant is capable of trying to deceive \nthe U.S. Government about his financial status.  He knows Applicant is very serious about \nsecurity issues, and based on 30 years of interaction, he is confident that Applicant\u2019s error \nwas unintentional and would not be repeated. He is also aware that Applicant is dealing \nwith an estranged wife, and based on his experience in dealing with such situations, it is \nquite common for the estranged spouse not to share certain financial issues.29  \nA retired U.S. Navy lieutenant commander has also known Applicant for 30 years. \nWithout reservation, he does not believe that Applicant would ever purposely attempt to \n                                                          \n25 AE Q, supra note 3.

She stated that Applicant \n\u201chas more integrity than any person I have known. His strength of character is evident as \nhe will not compromise his morals for any reason. I have never known this man to tell a \nlie or deceive in word or action.\u201d She added, that he possesses all of the following \nattributes: honesty, integrity, strong core values, and the strength to stand by them.32 \nThe director of the Navy\u2019s largest personnel support detachment has had Applicant \non his staff for three years. Applicant is considered very proficient and knowledgeable, \nwith a proactive approach in all tasks assigned. He is considered loyal, trustworthy, and \ndedicated to mission success. He is also versatile, self-motivated, and very reliable.33 \nApplicant has received several performance awards, including one for initiative.34 \nApplicant\u2019s military performance reports reflect an individual with outstanding future \npotential who is detailed, mature, motivated, and efficient, who always maintains a crisp \nmilitary appearance, has outstanding organizational skills, has an imaginative and \nproactive approach to problem-solving skills, and who is an honest broker.35 \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d36 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.

The memorandum directed the Defense \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d38 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.39  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.40 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n                                                          \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n38 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n39 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n40 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to \nquestions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his \ntestimony. It is my impression that his explanations regarding his financial considerations \nand personal conduct issues are consistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, as \nwell as an assessment of Applicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the \nallegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant failed to maintain several accounts in a current status and a number of \nthem became delinquent. Accounts totaling $45,544 were placed for collection or charged \noff. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nbecause there is no evidence that Applicant had the ability to pay his debts but was \nunwilling to do so.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;41 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;42 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n                                                          \n41 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n42 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all fully or partially apply. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties arose after he joined his mentor at a new employer after Applicant \nhad been very successful at his old employer. Because of the national housing crisis and \nplummeting national economy, he was unable to sell his residence and comply with his \nnew employer\u2019s policy-mandate that he reside fulltime within his designated geographical \nterritory within a certain time period. The result was unemployment. He endured lengthy \nperiods of unemployment, interrupted by relatively brief or seasonal periods of \nunderemployment, largely because he had previously been too successful and was now \ndeemed overqualified \u2013 situations that were largely beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s \nsavings were eventually depleted, and accounts became delinquent. Other factors \nexacerbating Applicant\u2019s financial situation were (a) his wife\u2019s failure to properly process \nthe family bills and she withheld significant financial information from him; (b) her injuries \nfrom an automobile accident in 2016; (c) his work-related injuries in 2016; and (d) \nHurricane Michael in 2018.  \nApplicant acted responsibly by seeking and obtaining even entry-level positions \nwherever he could find them, and by working with his creditors or collection agents.43 He \nentered into repayment arrangements with his mortgage holder, and eventually either \neliminated the delinquency or is within a month of doing so. He received Form 1099-Cs \nfor three accounts from one creditor, and the amounts cancelled were added to his \nincome on his tax return. And, although he has little evidence that he has resolved \npurportedly delinquent medical bills, it was not for lack of trying to resolve the unidentified \naccounts. Those entities that should have been aware of the accounts \u2013 the credit \nreporting agency, the hospital, the billing department of his medical group, insurance \ncompanies, and potential medical providers \u2013 all had no relevant information for him or \nhis wife. Applicant offered substantial evidence to indicate that his financial situation is \nnow under better control. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances no longer cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.44 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, however, \n                                                          \n43 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nApplicant transitioned into positive action well before the SOR was issued, and he now \nhas a history of fulfilling his promises. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise trustworthiness concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nAs noted above, in June 2016, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded \nto certain questions pertaining to his financial record in Section 26. Some of those \nquestions asked if, in the past seven years, he had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency; and had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for \nfailing to pay as agreed. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions, and certified that \nhis responses were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief. \nIn fact, his answers were incorrect, for Applicant actually had several delinquent accounts \nthat clearly came within the scope of the questions asked.  \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nAlthough Applicant admitted in his Answer to the SOR that he had deliberately \nfailed to disclose the material facts in his responses to the e-QIP inquiries, during the \nhearing he modified that admission by claiming that he did not purposely try to deceive, \nand did not know why he had answered as he had. He claimed that he had used his 2010 \ne-QIP for most of his entries, and noted that in that 2010 e-QIP, he answered the same \nquestions with a \u201cyes.\u201d He reiterated that it was not his intention to deceive. \n \nApplicant\u2019s comments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submission was \na deliberate failure to disclose negative financial information, as alleged in the SOR, or \nmerely an inaccurate answer that was the result of oversight or misunderstanding of the \ntrue facts on his part. Proof of incorrect answers, standing alone, does not establish or \nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the falsification or omission occurred. \nAs an administrative judge, I must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine \nwhether there is a direct or circumstantial evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s intent or state \nof mind at the time the alleged falsification or omission occurred. I have considered the \nentire record, including Applicant\u2019s initial and subsequent comments.45 \nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP, there were several issues taking place. First, \nApplicant was using his 2010 e-QIP responses as a guide in entering his 2016 responses. \nEverything was essentially the same, but, for some unknown reason, he did not use his \n2010 response for the 2016 response with respect to the financial inquiries. Instead of \nreporting the same correct answer and citing financial issues, he simply marked \u201cno.\u201d \nRegarding the home mortgage, Applicant\u2019s account was actually current until mid-2016, \nafter the e-QIP was submitted. As for the three credit-card accounts for which Form 1099-\nCs were issued in 2014 and 2015, his wife never acknowledged to him that the accounts \nwere delinquent and the balances cancelled, and he did not find out the true status of the \naccounts until substantially after the e-QIP was submitted. With respect to the alleged \ndelinquent medical bills from 2013 and 2014, Applicant assumed they were bills from \n2016 accidents, but he was wrong. Unable to track down the unidentified creditors, \ninformation regarding the accounts from providers, collection agents, insurance \ncompanies, or credit bureaus, Applicant\u2019s efforts have been blocked. If he was unaware \nthat the accounts existed or were delinquent until his OPM interview, Applicant could not \nhave lied about them in 2016. Recognizing Applicant\u2019s reputation for honesty and \n                                                          \n45 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden \nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). See also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant\u2019s level of \neducation and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to \ndisclose past-due debts on a security clearance application was deliberate).  \n \n\n \n15 \n                                      \n \ntrustworthiness, as described by people who have known him well for over 30 years, it \nappears that if Applicant\u2019s answers to the e-QIP inquiries were incorrect, it would have \nbeen aberrant behavior on his part to have done so deliberately. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.46 \n \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant failed to \nmaintain several accounts in a current status and a number of them became delinquent. \nAccounts totaling $45,544 were placed for collection or charged off. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nfinancial technician (travel auditor) with his current employer since April 2019, after \nserving in a different position as a clerk with the same employer since July 2016. A 1983 \nhigh school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1990, and earned a \nnumber of additional credits towards a higher degree. He served on active duty as an \ninfantry officer with the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) from August 1992 until June 1998, \nwhen he accepted a regular commission, and continued serving with the USMC until he \nresigned his commission and received an honorable discharge as a major in June 2000. \nApplicant was deployed overseas to Kuwait, Korea, Japan, and Somalia, and while in the \nUnited States, was involved in counterdrug operations. He was granted a secret \nclearance in 1994, and has been occupying a position of public trust since 2016. \n                                                          \n46 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances appear to be much better, and it is anticipated that they will improve \nnow that he has been installed into his new position with the civil service. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:47 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a good track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, resolving, or in the process of resolving, nearly all of his debts. As far as the $3,582 \nin unidentified medical debts, Applicant must be credited with good-faith efforts to resolve \nthem, but the absence of information regarding those debts has blocked his efforts to do \nso. Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a position of public trust.48 For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has successfully mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n                                                          \n47 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n48 As noted above, while Applicant initially applied for a position of public trust, his current position \nwith the civil-service is not a position of public trust, but rather a position that requires a secret clearance. \nThe adjudicative standards for both are identical. My decision would be the same whether his position is a \npublic trust position or requires access to classified information. \n\n \n17 \n                                      \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of public \ntrust to support a contract with the DOD, or a security clearance.

Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by her unwillingness to repay a debt to a former \nemployer incurred under unfavorable circumstances. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 31, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for a determination whether to deny \nher security clearance.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on September 26, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \neffective June 8, 2017.   \n03/27/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nwithout objection. Applicant did not submit any documentation. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on October 4, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 34, has worked for her current employer, a federal contracting \ncompany, since February 2018. She was initially granted access to classified \ninformation when she served in the U.S. Navy between 2004 and 2008. She completed \nher most recent security clearance application in July 2016, while working for a different \nemployer, and disclosed a $200 delinquent debt. An April 2016 entry in the Joint \nPersonnel Adjudication System (JPAS) indicated that Applicant resigned from a position \nin September 2015 after allegations that she falsified her timecard in June 2015. The \nensuing investigation also revealed that Applicant owed that employer a $13,000 debt \nfor tuition assistance.2 \n  \n \nBetween October 2012 and September 2015, Applicant worked for a different \nfederal contracting company. She accepted tuition assistance to pursue her graduate \ndegree with the understanding that she would be required to repay any benefits she \nreceived if she left the company within 12 months of receipt. In July 2015, Applicant \nlearned that she was the subject of an investigation into allegations that she was doing \nschoolwork during work hours. While the investigation did not substantiate that \nallegation, it prompted a review of her time cards, which showed that Applicant over \ncharged her time on three days in June 2015. Applicant believes a coworker with whom \nshe had a bad relationship made the initial allegation of misconduct.3  \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant resigned in lieu of termination. Upon her \nresignation, Applicant signed a promissory note, agreeing to repay $13,000 in tuition \nassistance benefits. Under the terms of the promissory note, she agreed to pay $1,088 \nfrom her last paycheck and $665.01 for 18 months. She claims that the employer told \nher that someone would contact her with the details of submitting her monthly \npayments. Because no one from the company reached out to her, she did not make any \npayments. However, the promissory note provided payment instructions, including point \nof contact information.4  \n \n \nWhen she reported the resignation on her July 2016 security clearance \napplication, Applicant indicated that she left the job \u201cfor a better opportunity.\u201d5 She then \nreported three months of unemployment. When asked about the disclosure during her \nAugust 2017 interview, Applicant admitted that she was concerned about how the \ndeparture would affect her background investigation. She also admitted that she quit the \njob before she was fired. At the hearing, Applicant stated that she was not informed that \n                                                          \n2 Tr. 13-14; GE 2 - 4. \n \n3 Tr. 15-16, 21-22. \n \n4 Tr. 16-18; GE 1 - 4.  \n \n5 GE 1.  \n\n \n3 \n \nshe was going to be fired, but that she chose to leave on her own terms before the \ninvestigation was completed. She claims to have contacted her former employer after \nthe background interview to honor the promissory note, but she failed to follow through.6  \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have a household income of over $200,000. In 2017, \nthey purchased a home for $725,000 and a vehicle for $80,000. She testified that she \nhas the means to repay the education benefits, but has chosen not to do so, prioritizing \nother issues in her life.7   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 18-19, 23, 34-38; GE 1, 4. \n \n7 Tr. 19, 27-30, 33-34.  \n\n \n4 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.8 Applicant admits that she owes a previous employer $13,000. \nShe has been on notice since her August 2017 background interview that the \noutstanding debt raised a potential issue. Despite having the means to pay the debt, \nshe is unwilling to do so.9 She failed to present any evidence to explain, rebut, refute, or \nmitigate the underlying concern. None of the financial considerations mitigating \ncondition apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nAccordingly, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s security worthiness. In reaching \nthis decision, I have considered the whole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). It is not the \npurpose of security clearance adjudications to serve as debt collection proceedings, but \nrather to determine if an applicant\u2019s treatment of their financial obligations is indicative \nof an inability to follow the rules related to the protecting and handling of classified \ninformation. Here, Applicant\u2019s continued unwillingness to repay her debt raises ongoing \nissues about her judgment and trustworthiness. Her inconsistent statements during the \nadjudication process regarding the circumstances of her September 2015 resignation \nalso raise concerns about her credibility and reliability. While Applicant\u2019s finances are \nnot a likely source of vulnerability or exploitation, her behavior regarding the treatment \nof her outstanding debt support a negative whole-person assessment that indicates that \nshe may not honor her fiduciary duty to the government when faced with negative or \nseemingly unfair consequences.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n9 AG \u00b6 19(b). \n\n \n5 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 22, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines D and J.1 The SOR further \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new \nAG, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was issued under the previous \nAG. Applicant was provided with a copy of the new AG prior to the hearing, and permitted time after the \nhearing to submit further argument based on the new guidelines. (Tr. 4-6.) \n01/31/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 14, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on October 22, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nOctober 11, 2018, scheduling the hearing for October 26, 2018. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which \nwere admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf. Applicant \nsubmitted 12 exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibit (AX) A through L, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record then closed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on November 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 through 3.2 After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges in (1.a) under Guideline D, a June 2017 arrest and an August \n2017 guilty plea to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and indecent exposure. \nShe was sentenced to twelve months in jail, with eleven months suspended and \nordered to pay fines. It cross alleges under Guideline J, the same information (2.a). \nUnder Guideline E, an amended SOR (3.a) alleges written falsifications that occurred in  \nJanuary 2017 to Applicant\u2019s employer regarding allegations about an inappropriate \nrelationship with a minor student; (3.b) falsification of material facts during a May 2017 \ninterview with an investigator in failing to disclose that she participated in a sexual act \nwith a student; and in another investigative interview in July 2017, (3.c) not disclosing \nthat after a minor student exposed himself to Applicant in a car, that nothing further \nhappened when in fact she did touch him and provided oral sex. \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is single and \nhas one young child. She received her undergraduate degree in 2008 and her graduate \ndegree in 2016. (AX C, F, G, I) Applicant taught high school from 2015 to 2017, when \nshe was fired for alleged workplace misconduct. (GX 1) She has been employed with a \ndefense contractor for about one year. (Tr. 59)  She has received a number of training \ncertificates in cyber security and counterintelligence. (AX L)  \n \n \nApplicant tutored a tenth grade male student while teaching in a high school. On \none occasion, she and the student were in a public library after school. (Tr. 21) The \nstudent\u2019s ride did not appear and Applicant stated that she would take him to his home. \n(Tr. 22) Applicant claimed that the student exposed himself while in the car and he \ndemanded oral sex. She acknowledged that she tried to fend him off but he was bigger \nthan she was. She testified that he tried to force her to give him oral sex. She continued \nto refuse but eventually she complied. (Tr. 23) \n \n \nAfter an investigation by the school, Applicant received a criminal complaint from \nthe police, and Applicant was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor \n                                                          \n2 Before the hearing the Government amended the SOR to include Personal Conduct. It alleged three \nfalsifications as noted above. \n\n \n3 \n \nand indecent exposure for the incident that occurred in May 2016. (GX 3, 4, AX H)  In \nAugust 2017, Applicant pled guilty to the misdemeanor charges. She received \nconsecutive sentences for the two charges. The total sentence was 24 months.  \nApplicant was sentenced to twelve months in jail, with eleven months suspended. (AX \nH) Applicant served her incarceration on the weekends.  Applicant \u201cshall be of good \nbehavior\u201d for a total of six years from the release from confinement. She has not had \ncontact with the student since the conviction. (AX H) \n \n \nApplicant initially denied that the criminal incident occurred when she received a \nletter of suspension from the school due to sexual misconduct. (Tr. 53) She told her \nemployer that it was a rumor and was spread on social media. On January 13, 2017 \nApplicant responded in writing concerning the incident.  She acknowledged that she had \ntutored the student and given him a ride home. She did not disclose any information \nabout the incident of oral sex in her car. (GX 3) \n \n \nDuring a May 12, 2017 investigative interview, Applicant described the May 2016 \nincident with the minor student and mentioned a social media post concerning romantic \nbehavior between Applicant and a minor student. She explained that she was not \ninvolved with the student. She made no mention of the fact that she gave the student \noral sex in her car. (GX 2) \n \n \nOn July 26, 2017, Applicant was again interviewed by a DOD investigator. She \nstated that the student exposed himself to her in the front passenger seat of her car. \nShe explained that she told the student that was not appropriate behavior and took him \nhome.  Applicant further stated that nothing happened, that she did not touch him, and \nshe did not know why the student made up this story. (GX 2) Applicant did not receive \nany counseling after this incident. \n \n \nWhen cross examined at the hearing, Applicant explained that she did not \nprovide the truth or the entire story as it happened because it was humiliating and \nembarrassing. (Tr. 56) During the interviews she never mentioned the oral sex. \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation. Each reference from a \nformer employer knew Applicant for at least two years and described her as honest with \na positive attitude. Applicant has exceptional organization and communication skills. \nShe is reliable and motivated. One letter of recommendation commended Applicant for \nher ability to encourage her students and build self-esteem. (AX A)  She attends church \nand is a member of her church community. (AX I, K) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \n\n \n5 \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. All are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n \n  \nApplicant provided oral sex to a minor student who she was tutoring. This \noccurred in her vehicle while she was taking him home. She did not show good \njudgment and put herself in a positon of vulnerability at the high school where she was \nteaching. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \n\n \n6 \n \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.  \n \nApplicant was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and \nindecent exposure in August 2017. She completed her consecutive sentences and is on \na condition of \u201csix years of good behavior.\u201d The evidence establishes the disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSufficient time has not passed since Applicant\u2019s 2017 conviction. She breached \na position of trust that a teacher has with a student. Granted this is a one-time \noccurrence and she has a good employment record, but given the fact that she used \nincredibly poor judgment with a minor student in 2016 and has not received counseling, \nshe has not met her burden in this case. The evidence does not establish mitigation \nunder either of the above conditions. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsifications, the following disqualifying \ncondition could apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant admitted the three separate falsifications under personal conduct. She \nexplained that she was very humiliated and embarrassed. She admitted that she did not \ndisclose the full story either in writing to her employer or during two investigations.  She \nis 32 years old. Granted she is a small woman, but the student, although larger than  \nApplicant, was a minor. She stated that initially she refused the student\u2019s request but \n\n \n8 \n \nthen agreed to perform the oral sex. She told officials at school that the student was \nstarting rumors. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.3 An applicant\u2019s level of education \nand business experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose \nrelevant information was deliberate.4  \n \nIn this instance, it is clear from Applicant\u2019s comments that she was embarrassed \nand humiliated and hoped nothing would occur. She deliberately falsified and omitted \nrelevant information on three separate occasions in 2017. I find substantial evidence of \nan intent by Applicant to intentionally omit, conceal, or falsify facts from her employer \nand the government. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is  established. \n \n \nApplicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct her falsifications or \nconcealment.  She spoke to two investigators and did not reveal the May 2013 incident \nand the oral sex. She also denied any oral sex in a letter written to her employer. \nApplicant has not persuaded me that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. \nShe did not seek counseling and she deliberately withheld relevant information on three \nseparate occasions. There is no information in this record to demonstrate that she did \nnot intentionally falsify and mislead the Government on three separate occasions. None \nof the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n                                                          \n3 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n\n \n9 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, E, and D in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant on three different occasions failed to disclose that she gave oral sex to \na minor student that she was tutoring in May 2016.  She was convicted in 2017. She \ndenied three different times that the incident occurred. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \npersonal conduct, sexual behavior, and criminal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nStatement of Case\nOn November 22, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, by Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2006. \n02/27/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 22, 2017, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on August 3, 2018, and scheduled for hearing on October\n23, 2018. The Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits (GEs 1-4) that were admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and seven exhibits. The\ntranscript was received on October 31, 2018.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documented IRS payments.  For\ngood cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the record. Department\nCounsel was afforded two days to respond.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documentation\nof satisfaction of payments owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 2013,\nan endorsement from her supervisor, and a performance evaluation. Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions were admitted without objection as AEs H-J.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated delinquent tax debts with\nthe IRS in the amount of $13,273 for tax year 2013; (b) accumulated delinquent state tax\ndebts in the amount of $1,073 for tax year 2013; (c) failed to timely file her federal income\ntax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014; and (d) failed to timely file her state income tax\nreturns for tax years 2013 and 2014.  Allegedly, Applicant has not resolved her delinquent\ndebts and filing lapses. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a and 1.c-1.d with explanations. She denied the allegations covered by SOR 1.b,\nclaiming she paid the taxes owed for tax year 2013 in September 2017. She further\nclaimed that she filed her federal and state tax returns late due to extenuating\ncircumstances (bad years, her words).\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old security systems specialist for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR that were admitted are\nincorporated by reference. Allegations that were denied by Applicant are reserved for\nfact-finding based on the developed evidence at hearing. \nBackground\nApplicant never married and has one three-old-son.  (GE 1; Tr. 23, 25) She earned\na high school diploma in June 1993. (GE 1; Tr. 23) She attended a community college\nbetween September 1994 and August 2005 but earned no diploma. (GE 1; Tr. 24)\nBetween April 2004 and August 2004, she took college on-line courses but did not earn a\ndiploma. (GE 1; Tr. 24) Applicant reported no military service. (GE 1)\n2\n\nSince February 2013, Applicant has worked for her current defense contractor as a\nsecurity systems specialist. (GE 1) She previously worked for this firm between October\n2005 and September 2010 as a security analyst. (GE 1; Tr. 27) Between October 2010\nand February 2013, she worked for another defense contractor as a principle security\nanalyst. (GE 1)\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant admits and IRS transcripts confirm that Applicant filed her federal income\ntax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 out of time in September 2017, after exceeding\nthe extension granted her by the IRS to October 2014. (GE 2 and AE A) Transcripts\nconfirm, too, that she owed the IRS $13,273 for delinquent taxes accrued for the 2013 tax\nyear. (GEs 2 and 4-5 and AE A)  For filing her 2013 federal tax return out of time in 2017,\nthe IRS penalized Applicant  $1,880. (AE A) Similar penalties were imposed on Applicant\nby the IRS for filing her 2014 federal return out of time in 2017. (GEs 2 and 4)  Applicant\nis credited with the timely filing of her 2015 and 2016 federal and state income tax\nreturns. \nBesides filing late federal tax returns for tax years 2013-2014, Applicant also failed\nto timely file her state income tax returns for these tax years. Ultimately, she filed her\nstate income tax returns in September 2017, well past the time reserved for filing timely\nstate returns for these tax years. \nApplicant attributed her late filing of her federal and state tax returns to extenuating\ncircumstances associated with her two surgeries, caring for her young son, and attending\nto her mother who became gravely ill before passing away in August 2014. (GEs 1-2 and\nAE F; Tr. 32-33) And she experienced emotional struggles with her father\u2019s passing. (GEs\n1-2 and AE G; Tr.  26)\nIn December 2017, Applicant  entered into an installment agreement with the IRS.\nIn compliance with her installment agreement she has made monthly payments of $190\nsince January 2016 and documented paying off the $12,361 balance owing in federal\ntaxes for tax year 2013 in November 2018. (AE A) Applicant also documented her paying\noff delinquent state taxes for tax year 2013 in September 2017 in the amount $1,589. (AE\nB; Tr. 37-38)\nApplicant currently grosses $120,000 a year and is able to maintain her financial\nobligations (inclusive of child care and rent) in current status. (GE 3; Tr. 39-40, 44) She\nhas a 401(k) retirement account with approximately $50,000 in the account. (Tr. 40-41)\nAnd she is aided by the occasional child support she receives from the father of her son.\n(Tr. 46)\nEndorsements\nApplicant is highly regarded by her program manager and colleagues. (AE E) The\ndirector of the DOD program she is assigned to credited her with being one of the most\n3\n\nconscientious and thorough employees with whom he has ever worked. (AE E) He\nconsidered to be highly reliable and trustworthy in handling sensitive data and interacting\nwith customers. Colleagues who have worked with her for several years described her\ncharacterize her as highly responsible in maintaining the security of the hospital networks\nshe works she is committed to protecting. (AE H) \nIn October 2017, Applicant was nominated by her benefits manager for a company\ncore value award. (AE I) And she is credited with solid performance assessments in all\ncategories of rating for the review period of 2016-2017. (AE J) \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n4\n\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n5\n\nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her federal and\nstate income tax returns for tax years 2013-2014 and her accrual of delinquent federal\nand state taxes for tax year 2013. \nFinancial Concerns\n      Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns for tax years\n2013-2014 and her incurring of delinquent federal and state taxes for tax year\n2013warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state,\nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.\u201d\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt\ndelinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of filing federal and state tax returns and resolving federal\nand state tax delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and guidelines\nnecessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a sensitive\nposition. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No.\n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating circumstances\n(i.e., surgeries, caring for her ailing mother and young child as a single mother, and her\nemotional struggles associated with the passing of her father) provide some mitigation\ncredit for her failure to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years\n2013-2014 and to address her federal and state taxes due for tax year 2013.s 2005-\n2013. Based on her cited circumstances, MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has some application to\nApplicant\u2019s situation\nBased on Applicant\u2019s  cited circumstances, the \u201cacting responsibly\u201d prong of  MC\n\u00b6 20(b) has considerable application. She is credited with filing her federal and state\nincome tax returns for tax years 2013-2014 in September 2017 (untimely, but still two\nmonths before the issuance of the SOR) and paying her delinquent federal and state\nincome taxes in full for tax year 2013. While Applicant was late in filing her 2013-2014\nstate and federal income tax returns, the IRS implicitly accepted her late filings in\napproving her installment agreement. With her payoff of the delinquent taxes she owed\n6\n\nher state taxing authority and satisfactorily completing her installment agreement with\nthe IRS, Applicant is able to demonstrate a good track record of compliance with the\nagreement\u2019s terms, and credibly claim the benefits of MC \u00b6 20(b)  See ISCR Case No.\n15-06440 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.\nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). For similar\nreasons, MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a  good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is available to mitigate her federal\nand state tax return filing lapses regarding tax years 2013-2014 and incurring of federal\nand state tax delinquencies for tax year 2013.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely filing of tax\nreturns. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)  In Applicant\u2019s case,\nshe has established a measurable track record of addressing her late state and federal\ntax returns and paying off her delinquent federal and state tax payments due with the\nadded benefit of an installment agreement with the IRS. Her collective efforts are\nenough to warrant favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised security\nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is favorable to Applicant. She has shown sufficient \nprogress to date in filing her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013-2014 and\npaying off delinquent federal and state taxes due for tax year 2013 with the aid of an\napproved IRS installment agreement to merit substantial mitigation credit. Applicant\u2019s\nmitigation efforts are aided by her demonstrated substantial contributions to her\nemployer and the U.S. defense effort generally. She is highly regarded by her manager\nand colleagues and has received solid awards and performance evaluations recognizing\nher service to her employer.\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing her finances reflect\nconsiderable evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment, sufficient to\novercome raised doubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect\nclassified information or occupy a sensitive position. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are\nwarranted that her finances are sufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum\neligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. Favorable conclusions are\nentered with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.  Eligibility to hold a\nsecurity clearance under the facts and circumstances of this case is consistent with the\nnational interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n7\n\n     GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT\n   \n                Subparagraphs. 1.a-1.d:\n                    For Applicant\n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a\nsecurity clearance.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 12, 2017, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n12, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing (NOH) on September 17, 2018, scheduling the hearing for October 9, 2018. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. \n03/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nI appended to the record, as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II, the Government\u2019s \ndiscovery letter and exhibit list. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through P, which I admitted in evidence without objection. At \nApplicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until November 6, 2018, for additional \nevidence. By that date, Applicant submitted additional documentation, which I marked \ncollectively as AE Q and admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on October 16, 2018.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 57 years old. He married in \n1993 and divorced in 2008. He has an adult daughter, and both she and his grandson \nlive with him.1 \n \n \nApplicant obtained a high school equivalency diploma in approximately 1980. He \nhas attended college since 2010 but had not yet earned a degree. He honorably served \nin the U.S. military from 1982 to 1986. He has worked as a graphic artist for a DOD \ncontractor since December 2016. He has never held a security clearance.2  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to the 2008 economic downturn; his \ndivorce; his job loss in 2010 and subsequent periods of unemployment or employment \nwith limited income; and his diabetes-related expenses when he did not have health \ninsurance. Applicant testified that through his divorce, he was held primarily responsible \nfor the debts incurred during his marriage. After he lost his job of five years as a \nmultimedia director at an architectural firm in May 2010, he went from an annual salary \nof $85,000 to being unemployed until June 2011. During this and his subsequent two \nperiods of unemployment, he attended school through a program available to military \nveterans, and supported himself, in part, through student loans.3  \n \n \nApplicant worked as a truck driver from October 2011 to December 2012, until \nhis diabetes affected his ability to work and he became unemployed for a second time \nuntil June 2013. He incurred medical expenses for his diabetes because he did not \nhave health insurance. In 2011, though he worked as a janitor and did part-time work in \ncomputer animation through his service-disabled veteran-owned small business, he \ncould not afford the mortgage on his $340,000 home that he purchased in around \nFebruary 2009. He moved out and found tenants for his home, but fell behind on his \nmortgage when two separate tenants failed to pay rent and the homeowners\u2019 \nassociation (HOA) fees from 2011 through 2014. During this period, he lived with his \nbrother; he rented an inexpensive apartment at $700 monthly; and he lived with his best \n                                                     \n1 Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; Tr. at 8, 76, 89; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 8-9, 73, 76, 92-93; GE 1, 3; AE F, L, M. \n \n3 Tr. at 16-18, 34-109; GE 1, 3; AE E, F. \n\n \n3 \n \nfriend for seven months. He was unemployed for a third time, from June to December \n2016.4 \n \n  \n \nThe SOR alleges two judgments from 2014 and 2015 totaling $2,407 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.b) and six delinquent consumer accounts totaling $36,847 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h). The \ndebts are established by a 2017 credit bureau report and court records. Applicant also \ndisclosed and discussed his debts in his 2017 security clearance application (SCA) and \n2017 background interview.5  \n \n \nThe two judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b for $2,407 from 2014 and 2015 stem \nfrom Applicant\u2019s tenants\u2019 failure to pay rent and HOA fees for his home. Applicant \ntestified that he used money from his 401k retirement account to resolve both \njudgments. The judgments were paid in December 2017.6  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a credit card charged off for $3,050. Applicant testified that this \nwas a joint credit card with his then wife, which he used to pay his mortgage. Applicant \nprovided documentation reflecting that he settled this debt for $1,835 and paid it in \nOctober 2018.7 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a credit card charged off for $7,708. Applicant was the primary \naccount holder but he permitted his then wife to be an authorized user. Applicant \ntestified that she continued to use the card after the divorce, but the card was later \ndestroyed. Applicant testified that he disputed this debt through the credit repair service \nLexington Law, and the debt was consequently removed from his credit. He also \nindicated that he attempted to contact the creditor to settle the debt, but was told that he \ncould not do so because the debt was forgiven. He indicated that he had not yet \nreceived an IRS Form 1099-C from the creditor, despite his attempts to obtain one.8 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a $294 charged-off account for a printer, which later turned out \nto not work. Applicant provided documentation to show that he paid this debt.9 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a $24,927 charged-off debt-consolidation loan. Applicant \nobtained the loan in 2009 to resolve debts from his marriage that were lingering after his \ndivorce. He indicated that after he lost his job, he used money from his 401(k) \nretirement account to pay down the balance of this debt to $13,504, with the intention of \ncontinuing to pay it once he found a job. He exhausted the money from his retirement \naccount and was unable to find another job, so the balance climbed to $24,927.  He \n                                                     \n4 Tr. at 16-18, 34-109; GE 1, 2; AE D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L. \n \n5 GE 1-5; AE Q. \n \n6 Tr. at 57-58, 60-63, 72, 80; GE 3-5; AE A, B, G, H, I, J, Q. \n \n7 Tr. at 63-65, 67-69, 72; GE 3; AE Q. \n \n8 Tr. at 63-65, 67-69, 72, 80-82, 102-105; AE N, Q. \n \n9 Tr. at 65-68, 71-72, 80-81; AE C, Q. \n\n \n4 \n \ntestified that he was advised by Lexington Law to obtain another debt-consolidation loan \nto resolve it. However, he provided documentation to show that he instead settled the \ndebt in October 2018 for $13,804, for which he would pay at $100 monthly until it was \npaid in full.10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a $676 apartment fee placed in collection. Applicant was \ncharged a fee by his apartment for his daughter living with him. Applicant indicated that \nhe paid this debt in June 2017. He provided documentation reflecting that this debt is \npaid.11 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is for a telecommunication account charged off for $192. Applicant \nindicated that he paid this debt in June 2017. He testified that he requested that the \ncreditor send him documentation reflecting his payment, but the creditor did not comply. \nHe provided documentation from the creditor reflecting that the debt was being removed \nfrom his credit reports.12 \n \n \nApplicant brought his mortgage current by utilizing a program available through \nhis mortgage holder that permitted him to make partial mortgage payments, while \ntacking the remainder onto the balance of the loan. He exhausted the money from his \n401k retirement account, obtained a student loan, and supplemented with money from \nhis janitorial and computer animation work to make his mortgage payments. He \nindicated that he has not had problems paying his mortgage since obtaining his current \njob. He testified that he is current on his monthly mortgage payments of $2,167, and he \nhas been current on his two monthly HOA fees totaling $240 since November 2017.13 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has worked diligently to improve his credit score by \ntackling his debts one at a time. He testified that he prioritized bringing a delinquent \nstudent loan current, which he did in June 2018, and paying other bills not alleged in the \nSOR. He testified that he has received telephonic financial counseling from Lexington \nLaw once every two months since June 2017, and he pays them $68 monthly. He \ntestified that he took their advice to continue rebuilding his credit by timely paying his \nbills, so that he could obtain a debt-consolidation loan to resolve any remaining debts at \nonce; he had not obtained such a loan as of the date of the hearing. Meanwhile, he \ntestified that Lexington Law was negotiating with his creditors for forgiveness of any \ninterest and penalties on his outstanding accounts. He provided a copy of his budget, \nreflecting a monthly income of $4,876 and a monthly net remainder after expenses of \n$785. He testified that he has not had a credit card for eight to ten years, and his sole \nline of credit was for his car. He testified that he commutes 106 miles daily to get to and \nfrom work.14 \n                                                     \n10 Tr. at 68-69, 71-73, 78-80, 102-105; GE 1, 3; AE C, N, Q. \n \n11 Tr. at 71-72, 106-107; GE 3; AE Q. \n \n12 Tr. at 71-72, 100; GE 3; AE Q. \n \n13 Tr. at 16-18, 34-109; GE 1, 3; AE C, K, O, N. \n \n14 Tr. at 16-18, 34-109; GE 1, 3; AE C, K, E, L, N, O, P, Q. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother testified that Applicant lived with him after losing his job. The \nbrother testified that he was aware that Applicant had just purchased his \u201cdream home,\u201d \nand encouraged Applicant to find tenants to live in it. He corroborated Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony that Applicant worked as a truck driver, then as a janitor, to make ends meet. \nThe brother testified that one set of tenants sued Applicant when he attempted to move \nback into his home. When they lost, they vandalized the home, which Applicant had to \nspend money to repair. The brother testified that Applicant\u2019s strength of character pulled \nhim through his difficult times.15 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s best friend of 25 years testified that Applicant also lived with him for \naround seven months in 2014, when Applicant faced difficult times and could not afford \nto pay the mortgage on his home. He testified that he never witnessed Applicant live \nbeyond his means. He testified that he found it commendable, and a reflection of \nApplicant\u2019s dedication, perseverance, and commitment, that Applicant ultimately held \nonto his home without having to file bankruptcy. As a clearance holder, the witness \nvouched for Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness.16 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n                                                     \n15 Tr. at 47-56. \n \n16 Tr. at 34-45. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to his \nfinancial problems. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. He credibly testified that he tried to continue to pay his debts during his \nperiod of hardship, by using his 401k retirement account, student loans, and the limited \nincome from his computer animation work. He continued his efforts upon receipt of the \nSOR and when he had the financial capability to resolve his debts once he obtained his \ncurrent employment. He also sought and received credit counseling. He provided \ndocumentation to show that he paid all of his debts, with the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.f. He was awaiting an IRS Form 1099-C from the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.d, and he \nsettled SOR \u00b6 1.f and was scheduled to make payments of $100 monthly until this debt \nis paid. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 1) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant failed to pay a $1,190 property tax bill for her home. In her \nMarch 2018 Answer to the SOR, she claimed she was paying $50 per month toward this \ndebt. She did not provide proof of payments, nor did she indicate when she started making \npayments, or how many payments she had made. (Item 1; Item 6 at 22)  \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.b. In 2014, Applicant purchased a home directly from the owner for \n$89,000. She fell behind on her $810 monthly payments, and in approximately March \n2017, she stopped making all payments per the recommendation of an attorney. Applicant \nwas advised to stop making payments to force a strategic foreclosure and a subsequent \nloan modification. She is currently delinquent in the amount of $14,618. In her Answer, \nshe claimed she was making monthly payments of $1,700. She did not provide proof of \npayments, nor did she indicate when she started making payments, or how many \npayments she has made. This debt was included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. \n(Item 1; Item 3 at 12, 19; Item 6 at 22; Item 7 at 11-15)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. This $349 medical account became delinquent in 2014.

This is an $8,656 balance on a car loan for a vehicle that was \nrepossessed. In her Answer, Applicant claimed that she is negotiating with her ex-\nhusband regarding this debt. She co-signed for the vehicle loan in 2007, but her ex-\nhusband was the primary user, and he stopped making payments in 2012. Applicant told \nthe government investigator that her husband was assigned this debt in their divorce. \n\n \n \n3\nHowever, this debt is not listed or addressed in their May 2016 divorce decree. (Item 1; \nItem 3 at 13, 15; Item 4 at 5; Item 6 at 26; Item 7) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. This $1,157 credit card account became delinquent in 2011. In her \nAnswer, Applicant claimed she was negotiating a payment with the creditor. (Item 1; Item \n4 at 11; Item 5 at 5) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September 2017. \nHer liabilities totaled almost $175,000, and her assets totaled over $121,000. According \nto the filing, her ex-husband owed her $1,800 for back child support. In her Answer, she \nclaimed she was in a payment plan with the court, but did not provide a status for the filing \nor proof of payments. (Item 1; Item 5 at 1; Item 6; Item 7 at 17) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit bureau report (CBR) shows that in March 2018, she \nwas three months behind on two student loan accounts. The delinquent amount totaled \n$478, and the total outstanding balance owed was $20,832. (Item 5 at 4)  \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d1 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d2 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d3 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n2 Egan at 527. \n \n3 Executive Order (EO) 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n\n \n \n4\nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d4 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.5 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d6 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability.7 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.8 An applicant has the burden of proving a potential mitigating condition, and the \nburden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.9 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d10 \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d11 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under Guideline F is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n                                                          \n4 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n5 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n6 See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7 See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n8 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n9 ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n10 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant experienced personal issues that contributed to her financial \ndelinquencies; however, she did not establish that she acted responsibly to address the \nalleged unpaid debts. Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in September \n2017 to address and repay her obligations; however, she failed to provide proof of \npayments toward the bankruptcy. Additionally, her most recent CBR shows that she is \nthree months behind on her student loan payments, demonstrating that her financial \nsituation is an ongoing issue. Her debts remain unresolved, and they are significant.    \n \n \nApplicant did not provide proof of any payments toward her delinquent debts in her \nAnswer.

Charles McCullough, III, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has filed her delinquent income tax returns, obtained a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge of approximately 90 percent of the outstanding balance due, and has \norganized a payment plan for the remaining balance. These facts, when considered \ntogether with the cause of her income tax problems, compel me to conclude she has \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns.  Eligibility to continue working in a public trust \nposition is granted.   \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 4, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \ntrustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a position of trust. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/05/2019\n\n2 \n \nOn December 22, 2017, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of \nthe allegations, and requesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on July \n20, 2018.  On September 13, 2018, the hearing was scheduled for October 31, 2018. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. I received eight Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 8) and 12 \nApplicant exhibits (AE A \u2013 AE L). In addition, I considered the testimony of Applicant and \ntwo character witnesses. At the close of the hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel\u2019s request, to allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted two additional exhibits that I incorporated into the record as \nAE M and AE N. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 9, 2018. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nWhile reviewing the case file, I discovered an additional exhibit that Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel submitted, which was unmarked and unidentified. After informing both parties of \nthe oversight, I marked it as AE O, and provided a copy of the document to Department \nCounsel, who had no objection to its admission.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 45-year-old single woman with two children. She has been married \npreviously, from 2000 to 2014. The marriage ended in divorce. (Tr. 74) She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1995. Applicant is an information technology professional who \noversees the processing of military health data. (AE J at 5) She has been employed in this \nline of work since 1995. (Tr. 42) \n \n \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. Her supervisor characterized her work as \nstellar. (Tr. 17) Per a team member from another company, Applicant has in-depth \nknowledge of data processing and is a critical member of the team. (AE J at 4) \n \n \nApplicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns timely for tax years \n2009 to 2013. (Answer at 1) She attributes her failure to file income tax returns to her \ntroubled marriage, which by 2009 had begun to deteriorate. Specifically, her husband \nwhose $140,000 salary exceeded hers by $40,000, \u201cwasn\u2019t pulling his weight\u201d with the filing \nof tax returns and the corresponding tax bills, leaving her solely responsible for their filing \nand payment each year. (Tr. 50) By 2009, she \u201chad had it.\u201d (Tr. 50) Consequently, she told \nhim that she was no longer going to file the tax returns and pay the tax debts, and that he \nhad to do it. (Tr. 51) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband did not file the federal and state tax returns either for 2009 or \n2010. (Tr. 53) Periodically, Applicant would ask him if he had filed them, and he would \nreassure her that he was working on them. (Tr. 81-83) Unbeknownst to Applicant, her \nhusband filed his income tax returns individually. Ultimately, she did not discover that he \nwas not filing the income tax returns jointly until 2011, when he moved from the family \nhome. (Tr. 83)  \n \n\n3 \n \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s husband left her, her financial problems snowballed. (Tr. 53) \nDespite earning a higher salary, he paid less than half of the children\u2019s expenses. \nMoreover, although they shared joint custody, the children stayed with Applicant \napproximately 75 percent of the time. (Tr. 80) \n \n \nApplicant remained hopeful that she and her husband would reconcile and that he \nwould help her with her financial problems. Although they made some attempts at \nreconciliation, he never moved back into the home. In 2015, he told her that he was in love \nwith someone else, was filing for divorce, and getting remarried. (Tr. 44) Preoccupied and \nemotionally devastated by her failing marriage,1 Applicant had failed to file her state and \nfederal income tax returns for 2011 to 2013, in addition to 2009 and 2010, by the time her \ndivorce was finalized. (Tr. 57) \n \n \nAs part of the divorce settlement, Applicant\u2019s ex-husband was supposed to pay part \nof the tax delinquency. (Tr. 55) He did not do so. After the divorce was finalized, Applicant \nretained an attorney to help her file her delinquent income tax returns. (GE 7) By this time, \nthe federal government had entered a lien against her property for $214,039 in federal \nincome taxes, and she owed approximately $15,000 in delinquent state income taxes for \ntax years 2009 through 2014. (GE 7 at 1; Item 2 at 3-4; Answer at 1) With the help of her \nattorney, she filed her state income tax returns, and negotiated a payment plan with the \nstate tax authority. (Item 2 at 4) Beginning in September 2015, she began making $950 \nmonthly payments consistent with the plan. By September 2017, she had satisfied her \nstate income tax delinquency. (GE 3 at 20)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s attorney attempted to negotiate an offer-in-compromise (OIC) with the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). Through her attorney, Applicant proposed to make \nmonthly payments for the part of the delinquency from 2009 through 2013 that remained \nlegally collectible, totaling 24 months. (GE 7 at 2) OIC negotiations lasted approximately a \nyear between 2016 and 2017. While negotiations were pending, Applicant paid $675 per \nmonth towards the delinquency. (Tr. 120) \n \n \nThe IRS rejected the proposed OIC. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant\u2019s attorney then referred \nher to a bankruptcy attorney. On August 14, 2017, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection (AE D at 1) The case was later converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nUnder the plan, she sought a discharge of her tax debts from 2009 to 2014. On September \n12, 2018, the court discharged all of the debt for tax years 2009 through 2013. (AE B, AE \nC) It denied her request to discharge the 2014 bankruptcy, reasoning that it remained a \npriority debt because of its recency. (AE D at 1) \n \n \nApplicant then contacted the IRS and entered into an installment agreement to pay \nthe remaining 2014 income tax balance, totaling $26,868. (AE D at 1; AE E) Monthly \npayments of $430 were scheduled to begin in November 2018. (AE N) The lien remains \noutstanding. \n \n                                                 \n1 Applicant\u2019s emotional distress from the marital separation was so acute that it prompted her doctor to \nprescribe her anti-depressants. (Tr. 122) \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant has been filing her taxes timely since 2015. Her federal tax payments from \n2015 through 2017 are all up-to-date and no balance is owed. (AE M) She has been \nmaking payments on her 2018 tax returns on a quarterly basis. Payments are current. (Tr. \n57) \n \n \nApplicant currently earns between $100,000 and $110,000. She maintains a budget \nand has between $200 and $300 of monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 117) She credits the \nfinancial management course she took as part of the bankruptcy proceedings with \nimproving her financial management skills. (Tr. 114)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination. \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \n                                                 \n2 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n\n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 \n18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified [or sensitive] information. . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant failed to file or pay her federal and state income tax delinquencies on time \nbetween 2009 and 2013. As of 2017, a lien was entered against her property for \noutstanding delinquent income taxes, including for tax year 2014. The following \ndisqualifying conditions apply under AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f)  failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual federal state, or local income taxes, as \nrequired. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n\n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file and pay her federal and state income taxes coincided with \nher emotional trauma resulting from the deterioration of her marriage. Conversely, her \nfailure to file her income tax returns began two years before her marital separation and \nlasted for two additional years through 2013. Ultimately, however, after Applicant finally \naccepted that she and her husband were not reconciling, she began actively attempting to \nresolve her income tax debts. She retained an attorney, filed her returns, satisfied her state \ndelinquency through a negotiated payment arrangement, and attempted to negotiate a \npayment arrangement with the IRS. After her attempts at executing an OIC with the IRS \nfailed, she consulted a bankruptcy attorney upon the advice of her tax attorney, and filed \nfor bankruptcy protection. She obtained a discharge of all of her federal income tax debt \nexcept $25,000 owed for tax year 2014, which she has arranged to pay through an \ninstallment plan. Consequently, although Applicant did not initially act responsibly with \nrespect to her financial problems when her marriage first began to deteriorate, she has \nbeen acting responsibly since 2015 after the divorce was finalized. On balance, I conclude \nthat AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant has filed all her delinquent federal and state income tax returns. She has \nsatisfied the state income tax delinquency in its entirety, attended financial counseling, and \ndeveloped an installment plan to pay the remaining federal tax delinquency. She maintains \na budget and has enough money to pay the anticipated $430 monthly tax payment. Under \nthese circumstances, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g), apply. In sum, Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nFailure to file one\u2019s income tax returns is a serious transgression. Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, however, was clouded by the emotional trauma she experienced related to the \ndeterioration of her marriage. Once she accepted that her marriage was over, she began \ntaking prudent steps to resolve her delinquent income tax debts. Currently, all but \napproximately ten percent of her federal and state income taxes have been either \ndischarged, or satisfied, and she has developed a plan to pay the remainder. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for a position \nof trust. Eligibility for a position of trust is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant accumulated \ndebts from a business venture from 2001 to 2005, and defaulted on other debts and credit \ncards. The largest SOR debt is an $18,734 new car loan from 2011 that became \ndelinquent in 2012 after Applicant had an accident and stopped paying. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Since \nshe was uninsured and could not afford the repairs, she abandoned the car with the auto \ndealer. This debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.i are duplicate debts for $2,876, for damage to a rental property. \nApplicant paid the collection company (SOR \u00b6 1.i) in May 2018, and provided evidence \nin her post-hearing submission. These allegations are resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account for a credit card that is past due in the amount \nof $896. Applicant testified that it was unpaid, and that she had not contacted the creditor \n\n \n3 \n \nor collection agent. In her post-hearing submission, she stated that intends to dispute the \namount owed with the assistance of a second credit repair company. This debt remains \nunresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - 1.f,2 1.l - 1.n, and 1.p - 1.q, are medical debts. Applicant testified that \nnone of the debts were resolved. However, in her post-hearing submission, she provided \nevidence of payments or partial payments toward the medical debts. They are now \nresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a 2009 judgment for $3,184 from an appliance and furniture company \nthat has not been paid. Applicant testified that she has not resolved the debt. In her post-\nhearing submission, Applicant stated that she was advised by a credit repair attorney that \nalthough the judgment is current, she should not make efforts to pay it so that it does not \nreappear on her credit report. However, the debt stays in the public record for 20 years. \nThis debt is unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a cable company debt for $600 on an item that was returned but not \naccounted for by the company. The debt also appears as SOR \u00b6 1.o. Applicant disputed \nthe debt and was issued a lost equipment ticket. She stated that after 30 days, the \nequipment will be considered permanently lost and the charge will be removed. SOR \u00b6 \n1.k is a credit card account for $290 placed for collection. In her post-hearing submission, \nApplicant stated the account has been paid in full. These debts are resolved. \n \nDuring testimony, Applicant stated that after her divorce in 2011, she believed that \nshe filed her 2012 Federal income tax return, and sent in a check for $13,000 in taxes. \nThe IRS notified her that they could not match the check with a tax return. Applicant stated \nthat she mailed in a copy of the return, but continued to receive letters from the IRS. This \nincident caused her to lose confidence in her ability to file tax returns, so Federal returns \nafter 2012 were not filed. Regarding state returns, Applicant claimed that she filed her \n2013 tax return in another state, but has not filed any other state returns. She testified \nthat she hired an accountant to file all tax returns owed, however she did not provide \nevidence of additional tax return filings or the current status of her efforts to resolve SOR \n\u00b6 1.s in her post-hearing submission. SOR \u00b6 1.s remains unresolved. In testimony, \nApplicant also admitted that she did not report her failure to file tax returns on her 2016 \nSCA. \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross income is $178,000. She testified that she had $2,500 in bank \naccounts and about $90,000 in a 401K retirement account. She borrowed about $30,000 \nfrom the 401K, and owes $9,000. Her spouse restarted a bath and beauty product \nbusiness at home, and earned about $8,000 in 2017 and $20,000 in 2018. Their business \ninventory is worth $15,000 - $18,000. Applicant testified that she needed to learn to be \nresponsible and manage her debts, and had never had formal credit counseling. She \nacknowledged in her post-hearing submission that her hearing was a \u201cwake up call,\u201d and \nthat she was ashamed that she allowed her financial neglect to impact her clearance. She \n                                                     \n2 SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of 1.q; and 1.e is a duplicate of 1.m. \n\n \n4 \n \nnoted that she needed to do better and needed help to be successful. She attended \nemployee sponsored debt counseling, created a budget, cut expenses, and started to \nsave for an emergency. She also contacted a debt resolution attorney to assist her with \nher debts. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n\n \n5 \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n6 \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial irresponsibility that dates back to at least 2005, \nwhen she filed Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Despite full-time employment since 2003, she has \nnot responsibly addressed her delinquent debts in good faith or in a timely manner. Her \ndelinquent debts may have been incurred under circumstances that were beyond her \ncontrol, to include her divorce in 2011, but she has not shown sufficient evidence of \nattempts to resolve the debts until after her hearing in this case. Her failure to file Federal \nand state tax returns for several years is further evidence of gross financial \nirresponsibility.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that became delinquent when Applicant abandoned the \ncar after an accident. It remains unresolved. SOR \u00b6 1.c is not resolved, but Applicant \nintends to dispute the amount owed with the assistance of a second credit repair \ncompany. She did not submit sufficient evidence of the disputed amount, but agrees that \nsome amount is owed. Applicant has not made sufficient effort to resolve the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, rather she is choosing to ensure her credit is not damaged by \nresurrecting the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.s concerns delinquent income tax filings. There is \ninsufficient evidence that this allegation has been resolved. No mitigating conditions apply \nto the allegations. \n \nApplicant is well educated, makes a substantial income, and has experience \nrunning a business. Her unexplained failure to pay debts and a judgment when incurred, \nand to file income tax returns when due, is troubling and inconsistent with a long-standing \nsecurity clearance holder. Applicant\u2019s testimony appeared to be honest and \nstraightforward, but her failure to report her tax return delinquencies on her SCA is \nunfavorable and does not give me confidence that she has a handle on her finances. \n\n \n7 \n \nDespite her efforts to address the smaller debts after her hearing, I am not \nconvinced that Applicant has control of her finances, can live within her means, and that \nfurther delinquencies are unlikely to recur. There is insufficient evidence of resolution of \nthe larger debts, filing of overdue tax returns, or financial responsibility. Mitigation credit \nis applicable for debts she has finally resolved, but no mitigating credit fully applies to \nunresolved debts, her failure to file tax returns, and her overall history of financial \nirresponsibility. I have not seen sufficient evidence of financial reform and a track record \nof financial responsibility to overcome the security concerns raised in the SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent, experienced employee who has shown a history of \ndisregard for financial matters. She has not shown that she is now financially stable and \nable to adequately address her financial responsibilities in a timely manner. Accordingly, \nI conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.s: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d - 1.f, 1.h - 1.q, and 1.r:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A.

Tilford, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant refuted the personal conduct security concerns, and he mitigated the \nforeign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 12, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and E (personal conduct). Applicant responded to the SOR on April 20, 2018, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to \nanother administrative judge on July 13, 2018, and reassigned to me on July 26, 2018. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 14, 2018.  \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, but he did not submit any documentary evidence.  \n12/18/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iraq. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2015. He seeks to obtain a security clearance. He has a \nmaster\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2013. He is married with three children.1 \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He attended college in Iraq. He then \nperformed his mandatory service in the Iraqi military for two years. He worked under \ndangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. military in Iraq from 2005 to 2007. \nBecause of his work with the military, he was eligible for a special immigrant visa. \nApplicant and his immediate family immigrated to the United States in 2007. He became \na U.S. citizen in 2013, while maintaining his Iraqi citizenship. His wife and three children \nalso became U.S. citizens.2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother, four siblings, and parents-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq. His mother has never worked outside the home. His \nbrother is a music teacher. His three sisters are married and do not work outside the \nhome. Their husbands have no direct connection to the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law retired from the Iraqi military. He receives a pension for his service, but he \nhas no other ongoing connection to the Iraqi military or the Iraqi government.3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandfather passed away in 2007 or earlier. Before he immigrated to \nthe United States, Applicant bought the family home in Iraq for the equivalent of about \n$15,000. His mother was living in the house at the time. He bought the house so that his \nbrother could live in the house and take care of his elderly mother. Applicant has no \nintention to ever return to live in the house. He estimated the current value of the house \nto be between about $40,000 and $45,000. He also owns a house in the United States \nthat he purchased in 2009.4 \n \nApplicant regularly contacts his mother by telephone. He will speak to his brother \nand sisters when he calls his mother. His wife regularly contacts her parents by \ntelephone. Applicant will usually get on the phone to say hello. He sends his mother \nabout $200 to $300 per month to help with her living expenses.5 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 47-48; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 19, 47-48, 51-53; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. at 18-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n4 Tr. at 19-21, 28-29, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. at 18, 21-22, 26-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant voted in an Iraqi election while in the United States in 2014. He wanted \nto promote democracy in Iraq. He returned to Iraq to work for defense contractors in \n2009, 2010 to 2011, and periodically since 2015. He does not visit his family while he \nworks in Iraq. He periodically visits his mother and other family members in Iraq during \nperiods he is not working in Iraq. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq could not be \nused to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.6 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nSeptember 2015. He answered in the negative to questions about foreign military \nservice; real estate in a foreign country; financial support for a foreign national; and \nvoting in a foreign election. Applicant testified that he did not intend to provide false \ninformation. He did not think he had to report the information about Iraq, because as an \nIraqi citizen, Iraq was not a foreign country to him.7 One of the primary definitions of \nforeign by Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary is \u201csituated outside one\u2019s own country.\u201d Since \nIraq was one of Applicant\u2019s two countries, his interpretation is not unreasonable. In any \nevent, I find it was honest and genuine. \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 18, 20-21, 45-49, 60-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n7 Tr. at 17-20, 30-45, 49-51, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, four siblings, and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of \nIraq. His father-in-law retired from the Iraqi military. Applicant owns a house in Iraq. The \npotential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, \nand it continues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and \nproperty create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying \nconditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \n\n \n6 \n \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.8  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He stated that his family in Iraq could not \nbe used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The Appeal \nBoard has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, unless there \nis record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the past in \ncomparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security.9 \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed \nthis issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n9 ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s work under dangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. military in \nIraq from 2005 to 2007 earned him a special immigrant visa. He has returned to Iraq to \nwork for defense contractors in 2009, 2010 to 2011, and periodically since 2015. I find \nthat Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. I further find that the property in Iraq is unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) \nand 8(f) are applicable.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about his \u201cforeign\u201d \ncontacts on his 2015 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through \n2.d are concluded for Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him a special immigrant \nvisa. He returned to Iraq several times since his immigration to work for defense \ncontractors. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in \ndefense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an \napplicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d10 The complicated state of affairs in Iraq places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign family \nmembers do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, and he mitigated the foreign influence security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Analysis Guideline F, Financial Considerations The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18: Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information.

Henderson, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information in a public trust position is \ndenied. \n Statement of the Case \nOn December 12, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for \nSORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on December 27, 2017, and elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 24, \n2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \n(NOH) on March 22, 2018, scheduling the hearing on April 10, 2018. However, \n04/30/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant did not receive either the physical copy or e-mail copy of the NOH because \nshe moved recently. (Tr. 12) So, Applicant was contacted telephonically and agreed to \nhave her hearing on April 11, 2018. (Tr. 15) Applicant affirmatively waived her right to \nwait 15 days from the NOH to the date of her hearing. (Tr. 13) Also, since Department \nCounsel\u2019s luggage was sidetracked in route to the hearing, he did not have the \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) for the hearing. I left the record open until April 25, 2018 for \ndepartment counsel to mail the GE\u2019s to Applicant and give her an opportunity to object. \nShe had no objections and submitted post-hearing documents during this period.1 I \nconducted the hearing on April 11, 2018. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on April 20, 2018. \n \n \n \n                   .    \n \n  \nApplicant is 25 years old. She graduated from high school in 2010. She was \nnever married, but has a two-year old daughter. Applicant lives with the child\u2019s father, \nwho is her fianc\u00e9. Applicant took some college courses, and she intends to return to \ncollege in the future to pursue a nursing degree. (Tr.19) She has been working in a \nposition of trust at a health care corporation for one year, with no problems. (Tr. 11) \nApplicant testified that she was attending college full-time when she incurred three of \nthe debts from rental arrearages. She was working, oftentimes at two jobs; she was 18-\n19 years old; and she conceded her financial mismanagement at that time in her life. \n(Tr. 22) She was laid-off from her job as certified nursing assistant (CNA) in December \n2010 and could not make rental payments. (Tr. 23)  \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the alleged delinquent debts \nplaced for collections at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.d, and the charged-off debt at SOR \u00b6 \n1.c. She also stated she was looking for a second job to pay off these debts. She \ndenied the medical debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e and disputed it because she had health \ninsurance, which should have covered it. After she disputed it, this debt was removed \nfrom her credit report. (GE 4) She testified that the delinquencies alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b and 1.d, resulted from her inability to pay her rent when she was in college from \n2010 to 2012. (Tr. 24-25) She provided a transcript of her college courses. She did not \nobtain a degree. (AE A) Her credit reports reflect that these debts first became \ndelinquent in 2012. (GE 2, 3, 4) Applicant provided post-hearing documents showing \nthat she reached out to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d and established a payment plan, \nmaking an initial payment of $107 toward that $982 debt. (AE B) Her five delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR total just over $13,000.  \n \nApplicant testified that the charged-off debt for $2,725 at SOR \u00b6 1.c was for a \nbank-credit card that she opened in 2015. (Tr. 27) She and her live-in fianc\u00e9 used it to \npay living expenses. When he lost his job in 2015, and she became pregnant, they \ncould not keep up with the payments on this credit card. She had to give up her CNA \njob due to the pregnancy. (Tr. 27-28) Applicant stated her intent to pay all of her \ndelinquent debts. (Tr. 29) Applicant testified that she is current on payments of $400 per \nmonth on $52,000 in student loans, which are outstanding. (Tr. 31) She is looking for a \n                                                          \n1 E-mail from Applicant to Department Counsel dated April 23, 2018 stating that she had no objection.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsecond job to help with expenses, and she is exploring an income-based repayment \nplan for her student loans.4 \n \nApplicant claims to have disputed the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.e for $172. The record \nwas left open for two weeks specifically so that she could produce some documentary \nevidence of this dispute, along with a budget and other substantiation of any \ncorrespondence with creditors. (Tr. 29-30, 43) She did not provide the requested \ndocuments. She testified that she did have some semblance of a budget, and usually \nhad approximately $300 left over each month, after paying expenses. (Tr. 43) She had \nno financial counseling. (Tr. 38) Applicant presently earns $34,000 per year, and her \nfianc\u00e9 earns $30,000. She stated that now that they have two incomes, she plans to \nstart a repayment plan with her creditors and buy a home. (Tr. 46) She provided no \nevidence of any correspondence or repayment plans with her creditors.           \n  \n \n \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n4 The SOR does not allege delinquencies on the student loans.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s exhibits support the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant admitted four of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling \napproximately $13,000. She provided a post-hearing document to show a payment \npursuant to a plan on SOR \u00b6 1.d. These longstanding debts are evidenced by her most \nrecent credit bureau report. She has endured periods of unemployment. In her Answer \nto the SOR, Applicant claimed that she disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e (medical) but \nprovided no evidence. Applicant produced no documents to show that she \ncorresponded with, or established repayment plans with the bank in SOR \u00b6 1.c, or the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. There is sufficient evidence to support the application \nof the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that she intended to pay her debts. Intentions to pay debts in the \nfuture are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 23, 2013). She testified \ncredibly that she disputed the $172 medical debt at SOR \u00b6 1.e, and it was removed \nfrom her credit report. Otherwise, she produced no documentation to show payments or \nprogress on any of her delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. The delinquencies alleged \nin the SOR are longstanding and ongoing. Her periods of unemployment were \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, but short-lived. She has not demonstrated that \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances. She provided no evidence of financial \ncounseling, good-faith efforts to repay creditors, or a budget to show that her financial \nproblems have been resolved and are under control. None of the mitigating conditions \nenumerated above apply except for \u00b6 20 (e) in connection with SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant is the mother of a two-year old child. She \nhas endured brief periods of unemployment and struggled through a downturn in the \neconomy.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a trustworthiness concern. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1. a \u2013 1.d:                       Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:                                   For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a  public trust \nposition.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On December 21, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n  \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on January 18, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on January 31, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on March 9, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 1, 2018. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 8, 2018.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor involved in technical \nsales. He is married with two children, and has a Master\u2019s degree. He has worked for his \nemployer since 1999, and is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security \nclearance in connection with his work with the DoD.  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegations 1.a and 1.b under this \nparagraph. He denied allegation 1.c. \n \n \n1.a and 1.b. Applicant used marijuana once or twice a month from approximately \n1990, when he was in high school, until December 2017, after Applicant received the \nSOR. During that entire period he would purchase marijuana once or twice a year, ending \nin June or July 2017. He bought it from friends, and eventually from a marijuana \ndispensary once marijuana purchase and use was made legal in his state. The longest \nperiod Applicant had gone without using marijuana was six months during the time he \nwas in graduate school from 1994 to 1996. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23, and \nExhibit 2; Tr. 19-25, 30, 36.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant denied that he stated in an interview in April 2017 that he intended \nto continue to use marijuana. Applicant stated that he would not use marijuana in the \nfuture if he received national security eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant testified \nthat he stopped using marijuana after he received the SOR in December 2017, \napproximately five months before the hearing. However, he indicated that he would \ncontinue marijuana use if he was turned down for national security eligibility, since he saw \nnothing wrong with marijuana use. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 31-35, 38.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his employer has a zero-tolerance policy for drug use, \nincluding marijuana. That policy has been in effect the entire time he worked there. \nDespite his failure to follow his company\u2019s drug use policy, Applicant stated that he was \notherwise trustworthy and followed his company\u2019s policies and procedures. (Tr. 28-29, \n36-37, 39-45.) \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of purchasing and using illegal drugs. Applicant repeatedly \nused marijuana between 1990 and 2017. He only stopped using the drug because he \nwas applying for a security clearance. His statement that he would discontinue drug \ninvolvement was not unequivocal, clear, or convincing. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nApplicant had not used marijuana for five months as of the date of the hearing. \nThat is too short a time to demonstrate that he will not return to marijuana use in the \nfuture. Applicant argued that marijuana was not an important part of his life, yet he was a \nconstant user of the drug for approximately 27 years, purchasing it during that entire time. \nEventually Applicant obtained a medical marijuana card to make purchasing easier. It is \nalso telling that he has violated a company rule against drug use during the entire time of \nhis employment. There is little to no evidence, other than his self-serving testimony, that \nhe will not return to drug use in the future if granted national security eligibility. Applicant \nhas not met his burden of persuasion to mitigate concerns arising from his lengthy history \nof drug involvement. This allegation is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns resulting from his long-term drug involvement. His expressed intention \nto discontinue drug abuse if required to obtain security clearance eligibility lacks \ncredibility, in light of his knowing and extensive violation of his employer\u2019s zero-tolerance \npolicy towards drug abuse. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to \nApplicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n                                                \n \n \n \n \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He testified \nthat she was being physically combative. He said he defended himself, but also said he \nbelieves she wanted him to hit back so she could press charges. His eldest daughter \nwas present. Applicant called police, and his wife left the house with them. She stayed \nwith her parents. A few days later, after she filed charges, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with assault and battery of a family member. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He later pled not \nguilty. In February 1999, he was tried and found not guilty after a bench trial, and the \ncharge was dismissed. Applicant and his second wife divorced later in 1999. (Tr. 52-54, \n81-83; GE 1; AE C)  \n \nDuring the winter of 2015-2016, Applicant purchased a new firearm, a bolt action \nrifle. He kept his firearms in a gun safe in the basement. He said friends came over to \nsee his weapons. He believes that, without his knowledge, one of them loaded a \nmagazine into the rifle with a round in it, and then put the rifle back into the safe. \nApplicant was out of the room at the time. (Tr. 42-44, 82-87) \n \nAbout a month later, in March 2016, Applicant was just getting over the flu, and \n\u201cwasn\u2019t thinking straight.\u201d (Tr. 132) He took the rifle out of the safe to clean it. His wife \nwas drifting in and out of sleep on a couch across the room. He testified, \u201cI opened up \nthe safe door, took the weapon out and grabbed it. I brought my hand down to support \nthe stock, and my finger caught the trigger and [it] went off.\u201d (Tr. 45, 100) The weapon\u2019s \nsafety was not engaged. He was holding the weapon upright. He did not know it was \nloaded. A round discharged and travelled over his wife\u2019s feet on the couch, went \nthrough a window pane, and hit a neighbor\u2019s parked car across the street. (Tr. 42-46, \n82-88, 100) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife \u201cscreamed and asked him what had happened.\u201d (GE 3 at 3) After \ncomforting her, he went outside to see if his neighbors were all right. He could not find \nthe bullet. (GE 3 at 3) Neither she nor any neighbors reported the incident. He and his \nwife had not been in an argument that day. (Tr. 44, 48) About a week later, a neighbor \nnoticed damage to her car and told Applicant about it. He paid for repairs \u201cright away\u201d \n(about $600-$800). (Tr. 48-50) \n \nApplicant and his wife separated in May 2016. In June 2016, she filed charges. \nHe believes that she did so at the urging of her daughter, with whom he does not get \nalong. (Tr. 88-90) Applicant was arrested and charged with brandishing a firearm (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and reckless handling of a firearm. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Answer; GE 1 at 36-39; GE 2; \nGE 3 at 3-4; GE 7) He pled not guilty. His wife later wanted to reconcile and she \ndropped the charges, which were dismissed with prejudice in February 2017. She \nmoved back in with Applicant in May 2018, and they remain together. (Tr. 50-51, 88-93, \n98-99; AE A; AE B) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he \u201cbroke protocol\u201d and did not handle the weapon \nsafely, in accordance with his training. (Tr. 47) He said he should have looked more \n\n \n4 \n \n \nclosely to see if the weapon was loaded. (Tr. 132) He has been familiar with firearms \nsince childhood. He had never had an \u201caccidental\u201d or \u201cnegligent\u201d discharge of a firearm \nbefore. He admitted he was negligent and expressed remorse. (Tr. 46-47, 88, 97-98, \n103, 138) After the hearing, he took a refresher course in gun safety. (Tr. 94; AE F)4  \n \nGuideline E \n \nIn 2014, Applicant was employed with defense contractor X. A female service \nmember made a sexual harassment claim, alleging that a particular employee of \ndefense contractor X had made inappropriate comments to her and had asked for her \nphone number. When the service member said she had a boyfriend, the worker told her \nhe was \u201colder and more stable and could take care of me.\u201d She also reported that he \ntouched her unnecessarily. Two other service members made statements reporting that \na contractor had also touched them unnecessarily or made inappropriate comments to \nthem. (Tr. 55-72; GE 6 at 1-4) \n \nApplicant is not specifically named in the statements. However, contractor X\u2019s \ninternal investigation, conducted by representatives from human resources, soon \ncentered on Applicant and another employee, Mr. A, based on their age, physical \ndescription and clothing. Both men were interviewed multiple times. The complainants \nwere shown photographs of both Applicant and Mr. A, and they identified Applicant as \nthe employee who acted inappropriately towards them. (GE 4, 5, 6)  \n \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s co-workers told the company interviewers that Applicant \nhad a history of getting inappropriately or uncomfortably close to other people at work \n(both men and women) and of making inappropriate comments, particularly to and \nabout women. (GE 6 at 4, 5, 6, 8) At hearing, Applicant testified that he felt that several \nof the employees who made negative comments about him during the company\u2019s \ninvestigation were racially biased against him.5 \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by the company\u2019s interviewers (both of whom \nwere women), he denied making inappropriate comments to the female service \nmembers and denied touching them inappropriately or unnecessarily, as alleged. (GE 6 \nat 7) He also speculated to the company interviewers that he was falsely accused: \u201cIt is \npossible the females got together to collaborate and bring charges possibly against \nthem;\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s the gospel truth (when asked why female [service members] would \nmake false allegations against them). (GE 6 at 6) \n \nAccording to the company\u2019s report (which paraphrases what Applicant said to the \ninterviewers), he also made several comments to the interviewers about the female \n                                                          \n4 Applicant also submitted a newspaper article about an incident in which a police officer accidentally shot \nand killed someone during a professional role-playing exercise. (AE D) Applicant offered the exhibit to \nshow that even for professionals with constant firearms training, \u201ceveryone makes mistakes.\u201d (Tr. 97) \n \n5 Tr. 60; GE 4 at 4-5.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nservice members\u2019 appearance: 1) \u201cIf we (HR) saw the [service member], she should be \nflattered because she looks like nothing and is not that attractive;\u201d6 2) \u201cWith regard to \nthe female [service member], if we can see what she looks like she should never make \ncomplaints and he would not waste his time;\u201d7 and 3) \u201cIf he was going to do that he \nwould not go after someone like that.\u201d8  \n \nThe company\u2019s interviewers concluded that Applicant met the general description \nof the subject employee, and wore specific clothing identified by the complainants. The \ninvestigation also concluded that in his own statements, Applicant \u201cwas very open about \nfemale [service members\u2019] behaviors to include whether they are attractive or not and \nhow [they] are perceived by their male counterparts when they get rejected.\u201d (GE 4 at 5) \nThe investigation also noted that Applicant\u2019s co-workers describe him as one who is \nknown to make inappropriate comments to females and touch them.  \n \nThe company investigation also confirmed that Applicant was trained in company \nX\u2019s code of ethics, conduct, and workplace harassment on February 10, 2014, 11 days \nbefore the complaint was made against him. Applicant acknowledged this at hearing, \nand said he had gone through similar harassment training earlier in his career at \ncompany X. (GE 4 at 6; Tr. 74-76) \n \nIn addition, company X\u2019s human resources substantiated that in 2009, Applicant \nwas reprimanded or moved to another workplace for what was perceived as acting \ninappropriately towards a female employee after he spoke to her in Arabic, stared at her \nand made her uncomfortable. (GE 4 at 6, 7) At hearing, Applicant acknowledged being \nreprimanded but said he had been smiling at another employee and applauding her for \ngetting an award. He disputed that he had acted inappropriately. He recalled being told \nby his supervisor to treat people with dignity and respect. Applicant told his supervisor \nthat he agreed but did not understand what he did wrong. (Tr. 72-74, 77-79) \n \nThe company\u2019s investigation concluded that the number of incidents reported \nabout Applicant carried greater weight than his adamant denials that he engaged in the \nbehavior, making it more likely than not that it was Applicant who behaved \ninappropriately towards the female service members. (GE 4 at 5, 6) As a result, in \nMarch 2014, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated, \u201ceffective immediately for \nviolating [contractor X\u2019s] Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and Workplace \nHarassment policies.\u201d Mr. A was exonerated and returned to work. (GE 4 at 7; Tr. 77) \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b) \n \nApplicant reported his termination from company X, and the reason for it, on his \nSCA. (GE 1 at 14) In the summary of his background interview, he explained that he \n                                                          \n6 GE 6 at 6.  \n \n7 GE 6 at 12.  \n \n8 GE 6 at 12.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nneeded access to a secure area. When he saw a female service member exit the \ncompartment, he asked to access it, but this was denied. He then said he asked for a \nphone number to contact supervisors who might grant him access to the space. (GE 3 \nat 1) In his Answer to the SOR, he provided similar information. He acknowledged \nreceiving a letter of termination. He said his termination was \u201cdue to allegations of \nsexual harassment,\u201d which he denied \u201cto the fullest extent.\u201d (Answer) \n \nAt hearing, Appellant denied making sexually suggestive comments to the \nservice members, or anything that might be construed as such. (Tr. 62-63) He did not \nacknowledge any specific action he allegedly took, or any specific statement he \nallegedly said, to the female service members. (Tr. 79-81) He stressed several times \nduring his testimony that he felt he had been wrongly accused, both by other contractor \nemployees (Tr. 60-61) and the female service members. (Tr. 100-101, 138)9  \n \nApplicant testified that his current employer \u201chas provided classes for sexual \nharassment and workspace ethics, and I have taken it, and I understand it, and I adhere \nto it.\u201d (Tr. 96) He submitted documentation of his training after the hearing. (AE F) He \nalso testified that he worked with women on active duty, mentored them and considered \nthem \u201clike my sisters.\u201d He also worked with female customers in his current job, and \n\u201cI\u2019ve never had any complaints. I\u2019ve had a lot of praises.\u201d (Tr. 101) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified that he has known and supervised Applicant since \nFebruary 2016. The witness has held his position, with a clearance, for eight years. He \nworks with Applicant on a daily basis. He has never witnessed Applicant engage in any \ninappropriate behavior, nor is he aware that Applicant has done so. He has not heard \nthat Applicant has ever made any lewd or improper comments. Applicant \u201calways \nseems to go out of his way\u201d to be professional. He has never had to counsel Applicant. \nApplicant has been through sexual harassment training, as required. Prior to the \nhearing, he was aware of the firearms charges but not the other allegations. (Tr. 105-\n113) \n \nAnother witness, a longtime close friend, has known Applicant for 18 years, since \nthey served together in the Navy Reserve. They are also former co-workers. The friend \nhas had a clearance for many years. He has never seen Applicant treat people with \nanything other than courtesy and respect. He took care to stress that he has no \npersonal knowledge of the allegations in this case, other than what Applicant has told \nhim, since he was not there when they occurred. (Tr. 114-123, 129) \n \nBoth men are experienced and practiced gun owners. They have gone to the \nshooting range together, and he is not aware that Applicant has ever had any other \nnegligent discharges. He does not believe Applicant discharged the weapon \nmaliciously. (Tr. 127-129) \n \n                                                          \n9 Applicant also submitted an academic article to bolster his view that that women make false sexual \nallegations. (AE E) \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe friend testified that sometimes a person might say something that could be \nmisinterpreted or misconstrued by the person who heard the comment. He attributed \nthis, in part, to generational differences. He acknowledged, however, that that is why \nsexual harassment and ethics training exists, to allow protections in the system for \ncomplainants, so they can address such issues with their supervisor. (Tr. 124-125)  \n \nThe friend is not aware of anything Applicant has said of a sexual nature that \nmight be misconstrued by someone who heard the comment. The friend never \nwitnessed Applicant being counseled or reprimanded for making physical contact that \nwas \u201cnot well received.\u201d (Tr. 126) The actions that led to Applicant\u2019s termination, \nhowever, are \u201cway out of his character.\u201d (Tr. 114-123, 128) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d10 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n                                                          \n10 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is applicable: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nIn 1998, during his second marriage, Applicant was arrested and charged with a \ndomestic violence offense against his second wife. In 2016, he was charged with two \nfirearms offenses after a negligent discharge of his weapon at home, while his wife was \npresent. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are alleged separately, though they arose from the same \nincident.11 Thus, they are more properly considered as a single allegation. SOR \u00b6 1.b is \nfound for Applicant, as it is largely duplicative of SOR \u00b6 1.a. Further, Applicant is also \nalleged to have committed both firearms offenses \u201cwhile holding a clearance.\u201d This is \ntrue, but the fact that he held a clearance at the time does not constitute additionally \ndisqualifying conduct under either guideline alleged. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to the offenses \nat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, even though they were later dismissed.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n11 Tr. 136-138.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions:    \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies to the 1998 domestic violence charge. The incident occurred \nabout 20 years ago, during a marriage that ended shortly thereafter. Applicant was also \nfound not guilty. He has had no other domestic violence charges in the years since \nthen. The offense at SOR \u00b6 1.c is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to mitigate the firearms charges (considered as a \nsingle allegation, as noted above). Applicant credibly testified that the charges resulted \nfrom a negligent discharge of his weapon, something which had never happened \nbefore. He was remorseful, and accepted full responsibility. He is an experienced gun \nowner, and he acknowledged that the incident should never have happened, and could \nhave caused great harm. He voluntarily took refresher firearms training afterwards. The \ngun charges are unlikely to recur and he took rehabilitative action. He has mitigated the \ncriminal security concerns.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \n\n \n10 \n \n \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n \n                     (2) any disruptive . . . or inappropriate behavior;  \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and  \n \nThe criminal conduct allegations, noted above, are also cross-alleged as SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. The general personal conduct security concern (AG \u00b6 15) and AG \u00b6 16(c) are \nsatisfied.  \n \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the Government had the burden to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant \u201cwas fired from \nhis position with [contractor X] in 2014 for sexual harassment.\u201d Applicant admitted that \nhe had been terminated and that it was due to allegations of sexual harassment. SOR \u00b6 \n2.b, as written, is established by the record evidence.  \n \n \nHowever, Applicant adamantly and consistently denied that he committed the \nacts of sexual harassment that led to his termination. He did so: 1) during the \ncompany\u2019s investigation of the complaints; 2) during the background interview for his \nclearance; 3) in his Answer to the SOR; and 4) at hearing.  \n \n \nWhen three female service members made allegations of sexual harassment \nagainst a company X employee, Applicant\u2019s employer conducted a thorough \ninvestigation. The company interviewed the subjects, Applicant and another employee, \nMr. A, twice. They interviewed several other employees, who verified Applicant\u2019s actions \nand described him as one known to make inappropriate comments to females and \ntouch them inappropriately or unnecessarily. Applicant was also identified in \nphotographs shown to the complainants. The company\u2019s investigation concluded that \nApplicant met the general description of the subject employee and wore specific \nclothing identified by the complainants.  \n \nFurther, though he adamantly denied the allegations, Applicant made several \ninappropriate statements to the company interviewers regarding the female service \nmembers\u2019 physical attractiveness and other perceptions about their reactions to male \nattention that lent credence to the allegations that Applicant was the employee who \nspoke to and acted inappropriately towards the female service members in the first \nplace. Given the strength of the independent evidence gathered during the \n\n \n11 \n \n \ninvestigation, and based on Applicant\u2019s own words, the company concluded that it was \nmore likely than not that he had done what he had been accused of, despite his denials.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that an employer\u2019s characterizations of events \nunderlying an adverse action are entitled to \u201csome deference.\u201d12 With that guidance, \nand in consideration of the Government\u2019s evidence as well as Applicant\u2019s testimony, I \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s termination, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, is fully established by \nthe record evidence, as is company X\u2019s rationale for it, as established by their thorough \ninvestigation of the service members\u2019 complaints. I therefore give the company\u2019s \nconclusions about Applicant\u2019s actions, and their reasons for terminating him, significant \ndeference. SOR \u00b6 2.b satisfies the general personal conduct security concern (AG \u00b6 15) \nas well as the \u201ccatch-all\u201d disqualifying conditions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(2) and (3).  \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:    \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and   \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \n \n \nAlthough the criminal conduct allegations are mitigated under Guideline J as \ndiscussed above, I must also consider them as part of the total pattern of Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior and judgment, not just in a piecemeal fashion as a series of unrelated \nincidents.13 Having done so, however, I still conclude that, while Applicant\u2019s criminal \noffenses are also instances of generally poor judgment, they are also mitigated under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) for the same reasons they are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n(d), above.  \n \n \nThis leaves SOR allegation \u00b6 2.b. On the one hand, there is some mitigating \nevidence to consider. Applicant\u2019s actions occurred more than four years ago. His \ncurrent supervisor testified that he is not aware that Applicant has ever engaged in any \ninappropriate behavior, or ever made any lewd or improper comments, in his current \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 14-0114 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 30, 2014)(citing ISCR Case No. 10-03886 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 26, 2012)). \n \n13 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22563 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) (regarding the need to avoid a \npiecemeal analysis). \n\n \n12 \n \n \njob. Applicant has never been counseled for inappropriate comments or behavior. He \nhas taken his employer\u2019s required sexual harassment training, and said he would \nadhere to it.  \n \n \nOn the other hand, several factors weigh against a conclusion that Applicant has \nfully mitigated allegation \u00b6 2.b. Chiefly, he never acknowledged any wrongdoing, either \nduring the company\u2019s investigation at the time, or at any time since, despite strong \nevidence that he committed the acts alleged. This casts significant doubt as to the \nveracity of his statement that he will adhere to the sexual harassment training he has \ntaken from his current employer. He took that training, but has not taken it to heart. \n \nApplicant\u2019s denials stand in stark contrast with his acknowledgment of \nwrongdoing concerning the negligent weapon discharge. In that instance, he credibly \ntestified that he knew he was wrong, that it should not have happened, and that he \nknew better based on a lifetime of training and experience with firearms.  \n \n \nIt is also noteworthy that all of the allegations in this case (even those that are \nmitigated), involve Applicant\u2019s interactions with women. Each time, Applicant asserted \nthat the charges were brought by women who he believed had something against him \n(his second wife, as to SOR \u00b6 1.a; his third wife\u2019s daughter, as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, \nand several female service members, as to SOR \u00b6 2.b) \n \n \nFurther, the credibility of Applicant\u2019s denials of wrongdoing in 2014 must also be \nbalanced against the weight of the independent evidence against him. As company X \nconcluded, the weight of the evidence here falls against the Applicant, and makes it \nmore likely than not that he committed the acts alleged. For AG \u00b6 17(f) to apply, \nApplicant must establish that \u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability.\u201d Here, given the thoroughness of company X\u2019s investigation, the \nopposite is true. The company\u2019s conclusions that Applicant likely did and said what he \nwas accused of, are substantiated and highly reliable. AG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. \n \n \nThe fact remains that Applicant\u2019s demonstrated attitude towards women, and his \nlack of acceptance of any responsibility for his actions towards them, or expressions of \nremorse, undercut any finding that he is rehabilitated, or that his actions are unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (d) do not apply to mitigate the security concerns established by \nApplicant\u2019s actions and comments that led to his 2014 termination, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b. Personal conduct concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make additional findings of fact as follows. Applicant is a 63-year-old research and development mechanic who has worked for his defense-contractor employer since January 2003. He has held a secret clearance since April 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 33.) Applicant and his spouse met in AA in 1985 and married in 1987. They were separated in 1994 but reconciled in 2004. They have been legally separated since April 2016 because of his drinking. They have a 29-year-old son who lives with Applicant and has a ten-year-old son of his own. Applicant\u2019s spouse has two grown daughters from a previous relationship whom Applicant adopted and raised as his own children. (GE 1; Tr. 33-37.) 4 Applicant began consuming alcohol at age 14. From 1969 until he turned of legal age to drink in 1973, he drank two beers or a half-bottle of wine monthly with friends. Over the next decade, he drank 6 to 12 beers twice weekly. In 1984, he began drinking daily, consuming six beers at a sitting in his home or at bars with friends. In 1985, Applicant recognized that he was drinking too much.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/14/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant relapsed into abusing alcohol in 2005 after 20 years of abstinence. He \ncontinued to drink alcohol against medical advice until as recently as July 2017, despite \nseveral inpatient alcohol-detoxification treatments and counseling programs for diagnosed \nalcohol abuse disorder, severe. He is presently committed to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), \nbut it is too soon to conclude that his maladaptive use of alcohol will not reoccur. Clearance \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse), Guideline I (psychological conditions), and Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nhim. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n\n2 \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR allegations on June 6, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn September 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 14, \n2017. \n \nAt the hearing, the Government withdrew the Guideline F allegation (SOR \u00b6 4.a) \nbefore the introduction of any evidence. Ten Government exhibits (GEs 1-10) were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Four documents were marked as hearing exhibits \n(HEs I-IV) for the record but not admitted as evidentiary exhibits: a June 28, 2018 letter \n(HE I) and a November 5, 2018 email (HE II) forwarding discovery of the GEs; an index of \nthe GEs (HE III); and a list prepared by Department Counsel relating the GEs to the SOR \nallegations (HE IV). Two Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted in evidence. Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 27, 2018. \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleges that under one or more of AGs G (SOR \u00b6 1), H (SOR \u00b6 \n2), and I (SOR \u00b6 3) the following: \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was admitted to a hospital in May 2009 for alcohol detoxification \nand diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder and heroin abuse disorder (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was treated from September 2012 to November 2016 for \ndiagnosed opioid dependence, alcohol dependence, and major depression \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a, and 3.a); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was admitted to a hospital in January 2015  (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and in \nJune 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for alcohol detoxification and diagnosed with alcohol \nabuse disorder; \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was admitted to a hospital on two separate occasions in July 2016 \nfor acute alcohol intoxication, i.e., he was transported by ambulance on July \n7, 2016, after he appeared drunk at a local store (SOR \u00b6 1.e(i)), and he was \ntaken by his daughter to a hospital on July 20, 2016 and referred to another \nhospital for detoxification where he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, \nsevere (SOR \u00b6 1.e(ii)); \n \n\n3 \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was admitted to a hospital for acute alcohol intoxication in \nSeptember 2016 where he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe, \nand alcohol dependence and referred for detoxification (SOR \u00b6 1.f); \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was admitted to a hospital for alcohol reasons on four separate \noccasions in October 2016, i.e., he was taken by a local fire department on \nOctober 5, 2016, after expressing suicidal ideation, and was diagnosed with \nalcohol abuse disorder and depression (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g(i) and 3.a); he admitted \nhimself on October 6, 2016, for detoxification and psychological evaluation \nand was diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder and depressive disorder \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g(ii)and 3.a); he requested alcohol detoxification on October 19, \n2016 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g(iii)); and he was taken by a local fire department on \nOctober 31, 2016, after expressing suicidal ideations, and was diagnosed \nwith alcohol intoxication and depression (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g(iv) and 3.a.); \n \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant sought substance-abuse treatment in December 2016 and was \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe, and opioid use disorder, \nsevere\u2014in early remission (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 2.a); and \n \n\uf0b7 Applicant was diagnosed by a duly-qualified medical professional in October \n2017 with alcohol use disorder, severe\u2014in early remission and adjustment \ndisorder with depressed mood (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 3.a). \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations with one \nexception. He denied the diagnosis of heroin abuse disorder in 2009. He submitted no \nexplanations. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the alcohol, opiate, and mental health-related diagnoses \nand to his various treatments are accepted and incorporated as factual findings. After \nconsidering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make additional findings of fact as \nfollows. \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old research and development mechanic who has worked for \nhis defense-contractor employer since January 2003. He has held a secret clearance since \nApril 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 33.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse met in AA in 1985 and married in 1987. They were \nseparated in 1994 but reconciled in 2004. They have been legally separated since April \n2016 because of his drinking. They have a 29-year-old son who lives with Applicant and \nhas a ten-year-old son of his own. Applicant\u2019s spouse has two grown daughters from a \nprevious relationship whom Applicant adopted and raised as his own children. (GE 1; Tr. \n33-37.) \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at age 14. From 1969 until he turned of legal \nage to drink in 1973, he drank two beers or a half-bottle of wine monthly with friends. Over \nthe next decade, he drank 6 to 12 beers twice weekly. In 1984, he began drinking daily, \nconsuming six beers at a sitting in his home or at bars with friends. In 1985, Applicant \nrecognized that he was drinking too much. Following completion of an alcohol-rehabilitation \nprogram, he attended AA meetings until 2001 or 2002. He eventually drifted away from AA, \nbut stayed abstinent from alcohol for some 20 years until 2005. (GE 10; AE A.) He started \ndrinking periodically on business trips with his co-workers. Before long, he was consuming \nalcohol on weekends in quantity of two to three beers or shots of liquor with dinner. He \nconcealed his drinking from his spouse because he knew she would disapprove of his \ndrinking. (GE 2.) \n \nIn 2006 or 2007, Applicant was prescribed a narcotic for pain from a local \northopedist for a condition misdiagnosed as sciatica. Applicant has variously reported that, \nafter two to three months of taking his pain medication as prescribed, he began illegally \nobtaining and using narcotics and OxyContin. He reported illegally using Vicodin on a \nweekly basis for five to six months and OxyContin daily for four months, which he obtained \nfrom friends and associates. (GE 10; AE A.) Medical records from 2009 indicate more \nextensive abuse of narcotics and opiates. (GEs 3-4.) Applicant acknowledged at his \nhearing that he abused prescription pain medications (Vicodin and OxyContin) from 2007 \nto May 2009 (Tr. 48-49) and that he also used heroin a few times when he could not \nillegally obtain OxyContin. (Tr. 51.) Most of the time, he obtained the prescription painkillers \nfrom friends and did not have to pay for the drugs. However, he also testified that he spent \n$5,000 to $6,000 for the drugs over the two years he abused them. (Tr. 56-57.) \n \nApplicant missed a couple of days of work in May 2009 because of his \npolysubstance abuse. On May 18, 2009, Applicant\u2019s spouse brought him to the emergency \ndepartment of a local hospital seeking help for his alcohol problem. His blood-alcohol level \ntested at .285%. He told medical staff that he had resumed alcohol consumption about five \nyears ago; that his drinking had gotten out of control in the past few months; and that in the \nlast three weeks, he had consumed a pint of schnapps per day. He also admitted that he \nhad been abusing opiates. Medical records indicate that he reported abusing opiates \n(OxyContin, Fentanyl patches,1 and some heroin) for the past three years to self-medicate \nfor pain, with his most recent use being on the weekend preceding his presentation in the \nemergency department. Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, opioid abuse, \nand alcohol intoxication, and referred to a hospital specializing in mental health and \naddictions treatment (hospital X) for alcohol-detoxification treatment. (GEs 3-4.) \n \nApplicant received voluntary alcohol-detoxification and opioid-detoxification \ntreatment at hospital X from May 19, 2009, to May 26, 2009. He reported to clinicians that \nhe began taking prescribed Percocet for pain about two years prior, and that when his \nprescription ran out three weeks later, he began obtaining pain medications from friends \n                                                 \n1 Applicant asserts that he used a Fentanyl patch only one time. (Tr. 51, 54.) He admitted that he used heroin \nwhen he could not obtain OxyContin and used heroin twice in May 2009. (Tr. 51-52.) Applicant acknowledged \nthat he had a DOD clearance when he engaged in illegal drug use. (Tr. 55.) \n \n\n5 \n \nand acquaintances. He reported illegally taking 60 mg. of OxyContin per day since then \nwith some increase to 80 mg. daily in the last year. Applicant stated that, at times, he used \n\u201chalf a bundle of heroin per day.\u201d2  He reported using heroin twice, and OxyContin and a \nFentanyl patch once during the May 15-17, 2009 time frame. He stated that he had also \nbeen consuming 1.5 pints of vodka per day for the last two years. Applicant expressed \nconcern about the possible loss of his job if he continued to drink. Diagnoses on admission \nwere alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence, opioid withdrawal, and opioid dependence. \nHe appeared motivated to cease his alcohol and opioid abuse, and was safely detoxified \nfrom both substances. He transitioned to the facility\u2019s partial hospitalization program (PHP) \non Suboxone3 and Trazodone with a fair prognosis if he became engaged in outpatient \ntreatment. (GE 4.) \n \nWhile at hospital X, Applicant began a therapeutic relationship with a psychiatrist. \nShe placed Applicant on Suboxone for his opiate abuse, and she had individual counseling \nwith Applicant weekly to twice weekly in 2009 and then monthly until August 2016, when \nshe terminated their relationship after finding out that he had been drinking alcohol while \ntaking Suboxone. Applicant knew he was required to abstain from alcohol while on \nSuboxone. (GEs 1, 4, 10; Tr. 59.) \n \nOn January 6, 2015, Applicant went to his local emergency department complaining \nof leg atrophy and weakness. He acknowledged that he was drinking approximately ten \nshots of alcohol per day while taking prescribed Suboxone, but expressed no interest in \nalcohol detoxification unless it would help his leg. He was diagnosed with alcohol abuse \nand discharged in stable condition, but advised to decrease his alcohol intake. (GE 3.) \n \nOn June 11, 2015, Applicant presented at the emergency department with moderate \nalcohol abuse. He reported that he had been binge drinking for the past week and wanted \nalcohol-detoxification treatment at hospital X. He was discharged from the emergency \ndepartment in stable condition. (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant had alcohol-detoxification treatment at hospital X from June 11, 2015, to \nJune 15, 2015. On admission, he admitted he had been drinking four to nine \u201cnips\u201d4 on the \nweekends with an increase over the past week to at least six or more drinks (\u201cshots of \nbourbon\u201d and \u201cnips\u201d) per day to intoxication while taking Suboxone. Applicant reported \nmissing several days of work recently because of his alcohol use, although he had the \nleave to cover his lost time and was not reprimanded. (Tr. 73.) He exhibited some \n                                                 \n2 Applicant testified that he was never addicted to heroin. He knew that heroin and OxyContin were both \nopiates and he told clinicians that he was buying a bundle of heroin per day because it was a way for him to \nget accepted into the Suboxone program. (Tr. 50.) \n \n3 Suboxone is a combination of two narcotics, buprenorphine and naloxone, both partial opiate agonists. It was \napproved for the treatment of opioid dependence by the Food and Drug Administration in 2002. According to \nstudies from the National Institute of Health, people addicted to prescription painkillers reduced their opioid \nabuse when given sustained treatment with Suboxone, which reduces withdrawal symptoms. See \nwww.nih.gov. \n \n4 Applicant testified that he drank as many as ten shots per day. Applicant\u2019s \u201cnips\u201d were the small bottles of \nliquor containing 1.5 ounces. (Tr. 74-75.) \n\n6 \n \nsymptoms of alcohol withdrawal, including tremors. He reported that he was actively \ninvolved in AA \u201cas a sponsor,\u201d and he expressed a desire to attend AA meetings on his \ndischarge. He was discharged in stable condition to continue to take Suboxone and follow \nup with his psychiatrist. Diagnoses at discharge included alcohol dependence, continuous, \nand opioid dependence, in remission. (GE 4.) \n \nIn 2015, Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist closed her private practice for a clinic affiliation. \nApplicant began outpatient counseling with a therapist at the clinic in September 2015 for \nhis diagnosed opioid use disorder, severe, in sustained remission; depressive disorder; \nand alcohol dependence. Applicant reported abstinence from alcohol and some \nimprovement in his depression after being placed on mood stabilizers. His psychiatrist \ncontinued to prescribe Suboxone for his opioid use disorder and pain relief, and she \nprescribed Campral medication for alcohol cravings. In early January 2016, Applicant told \nhis psychiatrist that he had thought about drinking a few times, but that he had maintained \nsobriety. Applicant was advised to attend AA. Applicant reported during counseling \nsessions in late February 2016 and early May 2016 that he was still not drinking, although \nhe now acknowledges that he continued to drink alcohol on weekends and hide his alcohol \nuse from his psychiatrist. (Tr. 64.) His mood was noted as stable on Cymbalta, although he \nwas stressed about a new home purchase. During a session at the clinic in mid-June 2016, \nApplicant reported that he had stopped taking Campral and that family stress had led him \nto drink alcohol. He was advised to take Campral, engage in counseling, and attend AA. \nHis opioid dependence was in remission. (GE 7.) \n \nOn July 4, 2016, Applicant began drinking heavily due to chronic pain. Three days \nlater, Applicant was transported by ambulance to his local emergency room because of \nalcohol intoxication. He smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred. He chose to leave \nthe hospital against medical advice, and he was discharged to his wife\u2019s custody. (GE 3.) \nApplicant was unable to work because of his pain, and he went on short-term disability, \nwhich lasted nine months. (GEs 3, 9; Tr. 47.) \n \nOn July 16, 2016, Applicant called his counselor at the outpatient clinic. He was \nintoxicated and was told he needed a higher level of care than the clinic could provide. He \nwas discharged from his outpatient therapy at the clinic on July 20, 2016, but allowed to \nremain in medication management with his psychiatrist as long as he sought a higher level \nof care. Diagnoses at the time of his discharge from the clinic were opioid dependence, on \nantagonist therapy, and alcohol abuse. (GE 7.) \n \n On July 20, 2016, Applicant was transported by his daughter to his local hospital. \nHe was diagnosed in the emergency department with acute alcohol intoxication and \nalcoholism. He reported two weeks of heavy drinking and steady drinking of approximately \na liter of vodka per day for the past five days. Urine screens were negative for opiates, but \nhis blood-alcohol levels were critically high. He had withdrawal symptoms from alcohol, \nincluding anxiety and tremors. Applicant was transferred to hospital X for alcohol-\ndetoxification treatment on July 21, 2016. (GE 3; Tr. 75.) \n \n\n7 \n \nApplicant told staff at hospital X that he had been consuming two pints of \npeppermint schnapps per day and that his increased drinking was precipitated by an \nargument with his wife and their subsequent marital separation. Applicant was diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder, severe. Treatment was attempted with benzodiazepines for a \nfew hours, but he was tremulous, agitated, and hallucinating. He was transported back to \nhis local hospital for medical treatment of suspected delirium tremens. (GEs 3-4.) \n \nOn July 22, 2016, Applicant was readmitted to hospital X for alcohol-detoxification \ntreatment. Notes of an attending psychiatrist indicate that Applicant was involved in AA and \nwas an AA sponsor. He was successfully detoxified from alcohol using the hospital\u2019s \nstandard protocol. At discharge on July 28, 2016, Applicant was prescribed Suboxone and \nurged to maintain sobriety. Aftercare plans included continuing with his outpatient \ncounseling at the clinic and medication management with his psychiatrist. (GE 4.) Applicant \nstayed sober for ten days only to again relapse into drinking alcohol. (GE 6.) \n \nDuring a medication-management session with his psychiatrist on August 2, 2016, \nApplicant exhibited moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. The psychiatrist \nassessed his progress in treatment as minimal, given he had relapsed with alcohol. She \nadvised him to contact hospital X as soon as possible about its intensive outpatient \nprogram (IOP). She noted his need for Suboxone to prevent withdrawal and relapse into \nopioid dependence, recommended counseling for diagnosed major depressive disorder, \nand ended her treatment with him. (GE 7.) \n \nDuring the morning of September 6, 2016, Applicant was brought to his local \nhospital by his son. Applicant was intoxicated at the time. He reported consuming ten or \nmore alcohol drinks per day and also feeling that his life was out of control. (Tr. 75.) He \nattributed his relapse to being discharged from his Suboxone protocol. He went into \nwithdrawals that triggered his relapse. He was seen as ambivalent about his sobriety and \nlacking insight into his situation. He was transferred to hospital X for alcohol-detoxification \ntreatment. (GEs 3, 6.) \n \nApplicant was treated at hospital X from September 6, 2016, through September 12, \n2016. He reported symptoms of helplessness. His treatment plan addressed symptoms of \nanxiety, depression, and substance abuse. On September 13, 2016, he was transferred to \nthe hospital\u2019s IOP consisting of clinical group therapy five days per week with the goal of \nrelapse prevention. On admission to the IOP, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, \nsevere; unspecified anxiety disorder; and unspecified depressive disorder. While in the \nIOP, Applicant was engaged in clinical group therapy, and he admitted that he had stopped \nattending AA, which led to his relapse. He expressed a willingness to return to AA and a \ndesire to remain sober. Over the next few days, he reported no substance use, but he was \nconsidered to be at risk for relapse. On September 15, 2016, Applicant was evaluated by a \nphysician for medication management. Applicant denied any suicidal ideation, and his \njudgment and insight were assessed as fair. He met diagnostic criteria for severe alcohol \nuse disorder and severe opioid use disorder. The physician recommended that he continue \nwith the IOP and regular AA meetings. Applicant continued to attend his IOP group-therapy \nsessions, showing receptivity to treatment interventions, but also some depression and \n\n8 \n \nanxiety. He reported attending AA meetings and contacting his sponsor. He remained \nconcerned about being at home alone, which was a trigger for his abuse. As of September \n29, 2016, he reported attending at least four AA meetings a week. (GE 6.) Despite his \ninvolvement in AA, he was unable to stop drinking. (Tr. 64.)  \n \nOn October 5, 2016, Applicant was transported by ambulance to his local hospital \nfor suicidal thoughts and alcohol intoxication. He had been drinking \u201cas much as he could\u201d \nover the previous five to six days after his son was involved in a car accident. Applicant \nwas diagnosed with alcohol abuse and depression. Applicant initially denied he had been \ndrinking and was belligerent with staff. He was medically cleared for discharge to home \nthat evening with the recommendation that he continue in his IOP at hospital X. As soon as \nApplicant arrived home, he drank alcohol. (GE 3.) \n \nOn October 6, 2016, Applicant went to his IOP and reported that he wanted to kill \nhimself. He went to his local hospital\u2019s emergency department for a mental-health \nevaluation, which was not conducted at that time because he was not sober. (GE 3; Tr. \n62.) Available medical records indicate that Applicant was then treated at hospital X until \nOctober 10, 2016. (GE 6.) \n \n \nApplicant resumed his participation in his IOP on October 11, 2016. He was \nremorseful about his latest relapse and indicated that he was actively returning to AA. He \nwas motivated to stay sober but admitted that he struggled on the weekends when alone at \nhome. Applicant reported significant issues with irritability and depression and being \noverwhelmed by health and financial concerns. (GE 6.) \n \n \nAfter drinking heavily for three days, on October 18, 2016, Applicant went to his \nlocal hospital requesting a placement for alcohol detoxification. He did not exhibit any signs \nor symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal and was referred to his IOP. (GE 3.) At the \nreferral of his therapist, Applicant received alcohol-detoxification treatment at a different \nhospital from October 19, 2016, to October 25, 2016. He admitted that he drank alcohol on \nmost Saturdays and exhibited blunted affect with depressed and anxious mood, but he \nalso appeared committed to sobriety. His judgment and insight were assessed as impaired. \nFollowing an uncomplicated inpatient detoxification, he was discharged in improved \ncondition with a primary diagnosis of alcohol use disorder with uncomplicated withdrawal; \ndepressive disorder, unspecified; and obsessive compulsive disorder trait. He was \nprescribed an anti-depressant, advised to follow-up in his IOP program, and given a \nreferral to an inpatient 28-day alcohol-rehabilitation program. (GE 9.) \n \n \nInstead, Applicant resumed his participation in his IOP. He appeared frustrated by \nhis recent detoxification stay and indicated that he had declined the referral to the \nrehabilitation facility because of the cost. Applicant testified that he had no guarantee of a \nbed. (Tr. 79.) In the IOP, Applicant struggled to accept responsibility for his sobriety. (GE \n6.) \n \n \nOn October 31, 2016, Applicant was transported by the local fire department to his \nlocal hospital\u2019s emergency department for a mental health evaluation. Applicant was \n\n9 \n \ndiagnosed with alcohol intoxication, depression, and suicidal ideation. He possessed a gun \nand expressed fear that he might kill himself.5 Applicant told medical personnel that he had \nbeen drinking seven to nine alcohol drinks on a daily basis for the last five days. He had a \nmental-health assessment on November 1, 2016, and was considered stable for discharge. \nHe was given a referral to a 28-day inpatient alcohol-rehabilitation program in a distant \nstate with treatment to be at no cost to him. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant declined the referral and resumed his participation in hospital X\u2019s IOP on \nNovember 3, 2016. He advised his therapist that he declined residential treatment because \nit was too far away, he had bills to pay, and he had to care for his son. Applicant was \ndepressed, but he had no suicidal thoughts. He expressed an intention to attend an AA \nmeeting daily and several AA meetings on the weekends to offset triggers. He was \npersuaded to attend a PHP more tailored to substance abuse. (GE 6.) \n \n \nApplicant reported to the PHP on November 4, 2016, as \u201cclean and safe and sober.\u201d \nSimilar to his IOP, his treatment plan included attending at least 20 support meetings per \nweek for treatment of alcohol use disorder, severe, to work on identifying triggers for his \nsubstance abuse and to learn coping skills. In addition, he received psychological \neducation and had psychiatrist appointments as needed with a focus on alcohol recovery, \nand depression and anxiety management. His anxiety was high at times because of \nexternal stressors, including a lack of funds. His short-term disability income was less than \nhis regular income, and he was not able to work because of chronic knee pain. He \nappeared motivated for sobriety and remained alcohol and drug-free. All toxicology screens \nwere negative. He attended AA daily and had a sponsor in AA and was receptive during his \ngroup therapy sessions. Applicant was transferred back to the IOP on November 9, 2016. \nOn November 23, 2016, he was successfully discharged from the IOP with diagnoses of \nalcohol use disorder, severe; unspecified anxiety disorder; and unspecified depressive \ndisorder (provisional). He reported no longer experiencing anxiety or depression. In the \nopinion of his primary therapist, Applicant had demonstrated the ability to use several new \ncoping skills. His therapist also noted that Applicant\u2019s main source of sobriety was his \n\u201cstrong connection\u201d with AA. Applicant was discharged with a good prognosis to continue in \naftercare consisting of individual therapy and medications for his anxiety. (GE 5.) \n \nApplicant had an intake session for counseling with an addiction-recovery service on \nDecember 1, 2016, Applicant reported a history of abusing alcohol and prescription \nmedications; sobriety for 20 years with the help of AA after completing an inpatient \nprogram at age 29; but then drinking on and off after going on a \u201croad job\u201d for his employer. \nHe attributed an increase in his drinking after he was cut off from Suboxone six months \nago. At its worst, he drank 13 to 15 nips every night, but he reported no drinking for the \npast 36 days. He admitted that he had spent \u201cthousands\u201d on opiates in the past. He denied \nsignificant symptoms of depression or anxiety. He was diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder, severe, and with opioid use disorder, severe, in early remission. Applicant \nparticipated in two individual therapy sessions and two group therapy sessions in \n                                                 \n5 Applicant now maintains that it was a BB gun. (Tr. 62.) He believes his depression and suicidal ideation were \na product of his heavy drinking. (Tr. 65.) Applicant testified that when he was not working, \u201cthere was no \nreason not to drink during the day.\u201d (Tr. 76.) \n\n10 \n \nDecember 2016. Available medical records from the provider reflect that his treatment was \nexpected to end in June 2017. (GE 8; Tr. 75.)  The last available progress note from the \nfacility is January 4, 2017. (GE 8.) Applicant testified that he completed the counseling in \nJune 2017 (Tr. 80), but he also told a clinical psychologist during an October 8, 2017 \nevaluation for the DOD that he stopped treatment because his insurance would no longer \npay for his sessions. (GE 2.) \n \n \nOn January 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant asserted that he abstained completely \nfrom alcohol from 1985 until 2005, but from 2005 to March 2016, he drank two or three \nbeers or shots of liquor on the weekends. He hid his alcohol consumption from his wife, \nwhom he met in AA, and also from his treating psychiatrist because he knew that she \nwould discontinue his Suboxone medication if he was drinking. He stated that he drank two \nto three nips of liquor three times a week after work from March 2016 to April 2016, when \nhis spouse left him because of his drinking. He then drank daily, although only one to two \nnips per day until July 2016 when his drinking increased to six to eight shots of liquor on \nthe weekends. He claimed he stopped drinking in September 2016 because he started \nattending AA, and he denied any intention to drink alcohol in the future. He acknowledged \nthat he had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, but also stated that he did not consider \nhimself to be alcohol dependent. Applicant discussed his recent treatments for his alcohol \nuse. With regard to the concerns that he was suicidal in October 2016, Applicant denied \nthat he was suicidal and explained that he had been discouraged because he could not \nstop drinking. He was in addictions counseling, and had been going to AA once or twice a \nday since October 2016. He reported an intention to continue with his addictions \ncounseling and with AA. (GE 10.) \n \n \nRegarding his misuse of opiates, Applicant acknowledged that he had illegally used \nVicodin and OxyContin, although he indicated that his abuse was limited to five or six \nmonths for Vicodin and four months for OxyContin starting in 2008. After receiving \ndetoxification treatment for five days for diagnosed addiction to opiates, Applicant was \nprescribed Suboxone, which he took for the next eight years. Applicant acknowledged that \nalcohol was contraindicated with Suboxone, and that after he tested positive for alcohol in \na urine screen in July 2016, his psychiatrist terminated the Suboxone. (GE 10.) \n \n \nOn January 12, 2017, Applicant met with the OPM investigator to provide further \ninformation about his alcohol treatments. He explained that his therapist wanted him to \nattend a long-term recovery program, but he chose to be treated at a more local hospital \nfor detoxification in October 2016. As for his previous claim that he had stopped drinking in \nSeptember 2016, he stated that his therapist told him that he had to drink in order to be \nadmitted, and so he consumed six nips before his admission for treatment in mid-October \n2016. (GEs 9-10.) \n \n \nApplicant remained abstinent from alcohol while attending about nine AA meetings a \nweek. He had surgery in January 2017, which proved effective in alleviating his chronic \npain. He took prescribed painkillers after his surgery with no misuse of prescription drugs. \n(Tr. 47.) He returned to work from disability in April 2017 (AE A; Tr. 46), but mounting \n\n11 \n \nfinancial issues,6 including federal and state tax delinquencies (Tr. 81), and problems with \nhis son led Applicant to feel depressed and overwhelmed. His son was abusing illegal \ndrugs (including crack cocaine and heroin), taking his money, and intimidating him. \nApplicant turned to alcohol to cope in June 2017. He consumed four to five nips of whiskey \nthe first day followed by daily drinking of as much as a pint of liquor. After three weeks of \nheavy drinking, he called his spouse in early July 2017, and she took him to the hospital. \nHe was transferred to hospital X where he received inpatient treatment from July 7, 2017, \nto July 14, 2017, for major depressive disorder, alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence, \nand suicidal ideation.7 He was on suicide watch briefly, but he asserts that he only \nexpressed suicidal ideation at his spouse\u2019s suggestion to ensure that he would be admitted \nfor alcohol treatment. (GE 2; Tr. 81-83.) Applicant now believes that his depression and \nsuicidal ideation were a product of his heavy drinking. (Tr. 65.) Applicant was discharged to \nthe hospital\u2019s IOP where he attended counseling three nights per week for about five \nweeks. (GE 2.) \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s inpatient stay at hospital X, his counselor filed a report of elder \nabuse about his son\u2019s behavior. The state\u2019s child protective services became involved \nbecause Applicant\u2019s son has physical custody of his ten-year-old child four days a week. It \nmotivated Applicant\u2019s son to become involved in treatment himself. As of November 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s son was attending an IOP, reportedly no longer abusing drugs, and employed \nat a donut shop. (Tr. 38-43.) \n \n \nOn September 9, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). Applicant disclosed that he had \nreceived mental-health treatment for an estimated eight months in 2008. In response to an \ninquiry concerning whether he had ever been hospitalized for a mental-health condition, \nApplicant reported that he had undergone voluntary treatment for five days in July 2016 for \nalcohol detoxification and for seven days in July 2017 for alcohol detoxification and \ndepression at hospital X. He also responded affirmatively to whether he had misused any \nprescription drug in the last seven years, but then disclosed that he misused OxyContin \nand Vicodin from January 2008 to May 2008, more than seven years ago. Applicant \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to an inquiry concerning whether his use of alcohol has had a negative \nimpact on his work performance, professional or personal relationships, or finances in the \nlast seven years. He reported that his drinking between March 2015 and May 2015 led him \nto miss work. He listed three alcohol-related treatments: his outpatient therapy at the clinic \nin 2015 and voluntary alcohol treatments at hospital X in May 2015 and July 2017. (GE 1.) \n \n \nAt the request of the DOD, Applicant was evaluated on October 8, 2017, by a duly-\nqualified licensed psychologist. Applicant indicated that he was again living with his son \nand grandson, who was no longer using drugs and was employed. Applicant discussed \n                                                 \n6 Applicant\u2019s disability benefit ran out after six months (Tr. 47), and he began to rely on credit cards to pay bills. \nHe resolved most of his financial stress by a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge granted in October 2017. (AE A; \nTr. 89.) \n \n7 The medical records from this admission were not presented in evidence. Applicant provided a copy of the \nrecords to the psychologist, who evaluated him for the DOD in October 2017. \n\n12 \n \nwith the psychologist his misuse of opiates obtained from friends and associates in the \npast to self-medicate for pain. He denied ever using heroin, although he indicated that he \nvoluntarily sought Suboxone treatment because he was concerned that his opiate use \nwould progress to heroin. He reported taking Suboxone for about six years before being \ndischarged for using alcohol. He denied any misuse of opiate pain medication since 2005. \nApplicant reported experiencing depression and suicide ideation in the past, but only when \nhe was drinking alcohol and facing a number of stressors. He reported that he was taking \nmedications for depression and sleep prescribed during his recent hospitalization in July \n2017, but also that he did not see any benefit to the medications and planned to stop \ntaking them. Applicant denied any consumption of alcohol since July 6, 2017, and any \ndesire to drink alcohol. He was attending seven AA meetings per week, working the steps \nwith his sponsor, and felt that AA had saved his life. Applicant expressed confidence that, if \nhe continued working with AA, he would be fine. (GE 2.) \n \n \nThe clinical psychologist assessed Applicant\u2019s optimism about his sobriety as \n\u201csomewhat excessive at this point considering his relapses despite being involved in AA in \nthe past and his relatively short period of sobriety.\u201d He diagnosed Applicant with alcohol \nuse disorder, severe, in early remission, and with a history of adjustment disorder with \ndepressed mood. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were only present within the \ncontext of Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol use or in the face of significant life stressors. The \npsychologist considered alcohol abuse a significant concern due to Applicant\u2019s long period \nof difficulties and his repeated relapses. He opined that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder, \nsevere, is a condition that would negatively impact his reliability, judgment, stability, and \ntrustworthiness. He noted that Applicant had an appointment to restart addictions \ncounseling, but that Applicant appeared ambivalent about restarting psychotherapy. While \nApplicant appeared strongly invested in AA, the psychologist recommended that Applicant \nalso have treatment and monitoring by professionals, such as in outpatient psychotherapy. \nThe psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis due to his brief period of sobriety \n(since July 6, 2017), his repeated relapses in the past, and his lack of recent consistent \nengagement in treatment. In Applicant\u2019s favor, the psychologist cited his lengthy sobriety of \nsome 20 years in the past; his AA involvement with a supportive sponsor; his resolution of \na number of stressors by recently filing for bankruptcy and filing a complaint of elder abuse \nagainst his son; and his recent outreach for help when needed. The psychologist did not \nconsider Applicant\u2019s drug abuse to be a recent or current problem, given that drug screens \nduring recent hospitalizations have been consistently negative. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant stopped taking his prescribed anti-depressant and sleep medications a \ncouple of months after he regained his sobriety and resumed his affiliation with AA \nfollowing his July 2017 treatment. He did not feel that he needed them. (Tr. 67.) He also \ndid not keep the appointment for addictions counseling. (Tr. 84.) \n \n \nApplicant does not allow alcohol or illegal drugs in his home. (Tr. 64, 89.) He has not \nconsumed any alcohol since July 2017 (Tr. 71), and he does not believe that he will \nrelapse if his son relapses. (Tr. 78.) He denies ever reporting to work drunk or ever drinking \nat work. (Tr. 74.) Available medical records show that he may have been hungover at work \nin the past (GE 2), but he was never reprimanded. (Tr.73.) \n\n13 \n \n \nApplicant describes himself as \u201ca recovering\u2014recovered alcoholic.\u201d He attributes his \npast substance abuse to an incorrect diagnosis of a physical condition which resulted in \nchronic pain that undermined his attempts at sobriety. As of November 2018, Applicant \nwas still attending seven AA meetings a week. Applicant has been an AA sponsor for about \nten months as of November 2018. He sponsors four AA attendees in his home group. In \nMarch 2018, he started a Saturday night \u201cBig Book\u201d meeting. He supports alcoholics in \nlocal sober-house programs by driving several men to area AA meetings multiple times per \nweek. Applicant has attended two weekend retreats and is involved in a group that \nemphasizes the 12-step recovery program. He has worked all 12 steps of the AA program. \nHe has had his current sponsor since August or September 2017. His sponsor has 12 \nyears of sobriety. (AE A; Tr. 85-99.) \n \n \nApplicant was not currently in any formal counseling or psychotherapy as of \nNovember 2018. (Tr. 88.) He does not believe that he currently needs any psychotherapy \nand explained that it never worked for him. (Tr. 93.) When asked to explain why he \nbelieves AA is now sufficient to guarantee against relapse given his relapse history, which \nincludes relapse after 20 years of sobriety with AA involvement for most of that time, \nApplicant responded that he was working the steps, sponsoring people, attending \nmeetings, and \u201cdoing the work that [he] wasn\u2019t doing at the end of that last 20 years.\u201d In the \npast, he got caught up with work and did not think that he needed AA anymore. (Tr. 101-\n102.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor provided a character reference letter attesting to Applicant\u2019s \ninitial struggles in recovery from his alcohol problem. He agreed to become Applicant\u2019s \nsponsor without reservations because Applicant demonstrated to him willingness to change \nhis life. He corroborates that Applicant has been very active in his local recovery \ncommunity by sponsoring others struggling with addiction and by starting a Saturday \nevening AA meeting attended by 30 to 40 people. In the sponsor\u2019s opinion, Applicant has \n\u201calways been a person with integrity, honesty, and morals as a driving force in his life.\u201d The \nsponsor has \u201cthe highest respect\u201d for Applicant. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n\n14 \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is articulated in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol when he was only a teenager. After completing an \nalcohol-rehabilitation program in 1985, he was abstinent from alcohol for about 20 years \nuntil 2005. Periodic consumption of alcohol on business trips progressed to weekend \ndrinking of two or three drinks. By 2009, he had lost control over his drinking, as evidenced \nby his consumption of a pint of alcohol per day preceding his request for alcohol-\ndetoxification in May 2009.  Over the next seven to eight years, he continued to abuse \nalcohol, despite repeated detoxification treatments; participation in counseling, IOP, and \nPHP; diagnoses of alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorder, severe; and while taking \nSuboxone against medical advice. Applicant told an OPM investigator in January 2017 that \nhe had stopped drinking in September 2016 with the help of AA. However, the evidence \nshows that he was not sober when his son brought him to the hospital on October 5, 2016. \n\n15 \n \nOver the month, he abused alcohol, leading to yet additional detoxifications and counseling \nfor his alcohol problem. Applicant maintained sobriety from November 2016 until June \n2017, when feeling overwhelmed by life stressors, he consumed a pint of liquor per day for \nabout three weeks. It led to yet another inpatient stay from July 7, 2017, to July 14, 2017, \nfor major depressive disorder, alcohol withdrawal, alcohol dependence, and suicidal \nideation.8 In October 2017, Applicant was evaluated by a duly-qualified licensed clinical \npsychologist, who opined that Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse disorder, severe (in early \nremission) is a condition that would negatively impact his reliability, judgment, stability, and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of maladaptive use of alcohol triggers the following disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accord with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 23 provides for mitigation \nunder the following conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n                                                 \n8 Neither Applicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol from June 2017 to July 6, 2017, nor his July 2017 detoxification and IOP \ncounseling were alleged in the SOR, even though they were referenced by the licensed clinical psychologist in \nhis report of his October 2017 evaluation. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the \nAppeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision \nof the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3. \n \nApplicant\u2019s latest relapse and treatment cannot be considered for disqualifying purposes, but they are relevant \nto assessing mitigation, including matters in rehabilitation.  \n\n16 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare, and has demonstrate a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \nApplicant asserts, and there is no evidence to the contrary, that he has not \nconsumed alcohol since July 6, 2017. His 16 months of continued sobriety as of his \nNovember 2018 hearing is viewed favorably. However, given his record of relapses after \nrepeated treatments since 2009, AG \u00b6 23(a) cannot reasonably apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) has some applicability, primarily because Applicant has a pattern of \nseeking alcohol-detoxification treatment when he felt that he had lost control over his \ndrinking. Some concern arises as to whether Applicant fully acknowledges the seriousness \nof his alcohol problem. He told an OPM investigator in January 2017 that he does not \nbelieve he is an alcoholic. At his November 2018 hearing, he described himself as \u201ca \nrecovering\u2014recovered alcoholic,\u201d which may be an expression of optimism about his \nrecovery or even more troubling, an attitude of complacency about his recovery. To the \nextent that he now attributes his serious relapses to a medical misdiagnosis which resulted \nin the physical pain that undermined his attempts at sobriety, Applicant shows he has yet to \nfully accept responsibility for his abusive relationship with alcohol. \n \n \nApplicant has never been disciplined at work because of his drinking, and he has \nnot had any legal difficulties because of his alcohol abuse. AG \u00b6 23(c) recognizes that \nindividuals with an alcohol problem are to be encouraged to seek treatment without fear \nthat doing so will cost them their job. Even so, Applicant\u2019s pattern of repeated, serious \nrelapses after several inpatient detoxifications and outpatient counseling efforts not only \nremoves AG \u00b6 23(c) from consideration, but it makes it difficult to fully mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns under AG \u00b6 23(d).  \n \n \nMedical record evidence shows that Applicant was successfully detoxified from \nalcohol in May 2009. He appeared motivated to cease his abuse when discharged to a \nPHP, and yet he continued to drink alcohol. By January 2015, he was consuming ten shots \nof liquor per day while on antagonist therapy (Suboxone) knowing that he had been \nadvised by his psychiatrist to abstain from alcohol. During another detoxification stay in \nJune 2015, Applicant reported he was attending AA. He falsely claimed during counseling \nfrom September 2015 to May 2016 that he was abstinent from alcohol. Applicant drank \nrepeatedly to intoxication in July 2016, which resulted in visits to his local emergency \n\n17 \n \ndepartment and another detoxification at hospital X. He consumed ten or more alcohol \ndrinks per day after his psychiatrist terminated his Suboxone for drinking alcohol, \nculminating in another inpatient admission for alcohol detoxification in September 2016. \nDespite attending AA after his discharge, he was unable to stop drinking. He was \nintoxicated when transported to his local hospital by ambulance on October 5, 2016. After \nyet another detoxification, he expressed remorse about his drinking to staff when \nreadmitted to his IOP on October 11, 2016. Within days, he was already drinking heavily. \nFollowing an uncomplicated alcohol detoxification at another hospital from October 19, \n2016, to October 25, 2016, Applicant still struggled to accept responsibility for his sobriety, \nas evidenced by his consumption of seven to nine alcohol drinks per day for the five days \npreceding yet another emergency department visit on October 31, 2016. \n \n \nApplicant was sober during his five days in a PHP in November 2016 and when \nreceiving counseling in his IOP from November 9, 2016, through November 23, 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s therapist noted that AA was Applicant\u2019s primary source of sobriety. After the \nIOP, Applicant followed up with addictions counseling, which he maintains he completed in \nJune 2017. Surgery in January 2017 alleviated the chronic pain that he submits was a \nfactor in his inability to remain sober. However, financial stress and problems with his son \nthen led to a serious relapse in June 2017. For about three weeks, he consumed about a \npint of alcohol per day. During his latest inpatient detoxification from July 7, 2017, to July \n14, 2017, he was again diagnosed with alcohol dependence. Applicant participated in \naftercare in the IOP three nights a week for five weeks, and he continues to attend AA on a \ndaily basis. However, a duly-qualified psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis in \nOctober 2017 because of his relapse history. The psychologist recommended that \nApplicant not only continue in AA, but that he also obtain professional counseling. \nApplicant did not keep the appointment that he had scheduled for addictions counseling \nbecause he believes AA is enough to maintain his sobriety. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s commitment to AA includes attending seven meetings per week, working \nwith his sponsor, providing other AA attendees transportation to meetings, starting a \nSaturday night meeting, and being a sponsor himself. Applicant\u2019s sponsor indicates that \nApplicant is intensively working his own program and is committed to putting his struggles \nbehind him. While I have no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s current dedication to AA, he is not \npresently engaged in treatment with any medical professional or qualified substance abuse \nclinician that could assist him to avoid alcohol should he face stressful circumstances in the \nfuture. For the reasons noted, the alcohol consumption security concerns are not fully \nmitigated.  \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are articulated \nin AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \n\n18 \n \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \n \nThe evidentiary record establishes that Applicant illegally obtained and used Vicodin \nor Percocet and OxyContin from May 2007 to May 2009, while he held a DOD secret \nclearance. Although he denied ever using heroin when he answered the SOR allegations, \nhe acknowledged at his hearing that he used heroin a few times when he could not obtain \nOxyContin, including twice on the weekend before his treatment for diagnosed alcohol \ndependence, opioid abuse, and alcohol intoxication in May 2009. On his admission for \ndetoxification treatment in 2009, Applicant reported to clinicians that he had used \u201chalf a \nbundle of heroin per day\u201d at times, although he now maintains that he said that only to \nensure that he would be accepted for Suboxone treatment. Applicant has variously claimed \nthat he did not have to pay for the drugs that he obtained illegally from friends and \nacquaintances, and that he spent $5,000 to $6,000 for the drugs between 2007 and 2009. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was treated for diagnosed opioid dependence by his \npsychiatrist from 2012 to November 2016, and for diagnosed opioid use disorder, severe, \nin early remission in December 2016. Available medical records show that Applicant was \ntreated with Suboxone from 2009 to approximately August 2016, when his psychiatrist \nterminated him from his Suboxone after she learned he had been using alcohol while \ntaking the drug against her advice. There is no evidence that he misused his prescription \nfor Suboxone. To the extent that he failed to follow his psychiatrist\u2019s advice regarding \ncombining Suboxone with alcohol, it reflects the seriousness of his alcohol problem rather \nthan illegal drug involvement. Regarding the December 2016 diagnosis of opioid use \ndisorder, severe, in early remission, the diagnosis was based on the fact that he had been \noff the Suboxone maintenance for months. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 apply: \n \n \n(a) any substance abuse; \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof substance use disorder; and \n \n(f) any illegal use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position. \n\n19 \n \n \nNone of the medical records reflect any illegal use of any drugs by Applicant since \nhe was placed on Suboxone following his 2009 inpatient detoxification. While there is a \ndiscrepancy between what he reported to the clinical psychologist who evaluated him in \nOctober 2017 (that he had not used any drugs illegally since 2005) and what is shown in \nthe medical records (illegal use to May 18, 2009), a substantial period has passed without \nrecurrence. Some concern arises because Applicant attributes his termination from the \nSuboxone program for his serious alcohol relapse in October 2016. His psychiatrist noted \nin August 2017 that he needed Suboxone to prevent withdrawal and relapse into opioid \ndependence. He had withdrawal symptoms, but they led him to abuse alcohol, which is his \nprimary substance abuse disorder. It is noteworthy that Applicant testified that he was \nprescribed painkillers after his January 2017 surgery, and that he did not abuse them. His \nson\u2019s abuse of cocaine and heroin in 2017 did not lead him to use illegal drugs. All drug \nscreens that Applicant took during his detoxification and counseling programs were \nnegative for illegal drug use. Applicant was not given a diagnosis of opiate or opiate \ndependence by a duly-qualified psychologist in October 2017. \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are established because of the passage of \nsome nine years since his illegal drug abuse without any evidence of recurrence. They are \nas follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of prescription narcotics and opiates, and of the illegal drug \nheroin while he held a security clearance is certainly not condoned. Should Applicant \nrelapse while in AA, it is likely to be alcohol and not opiates. The drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \n\n20 \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concerns about psychological conditions are articulated in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of depression for which he was first placed on a mood \nstabilizer (Cymbalta) while in counseling from September 2015 to July 2016. During a \nmedication management session with his then treating psychiatrist in early August 2016, \nApplicant exhibited moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. When his psychiatrist \nterminated her relationship with him because he drank alcohol while taking Suboxone \nagainst clinical advice, the psychiatrist recommended that he seek counseling for his \ndiagnosed major depressive disorder. Applicant exhibited symptoms of anxiety and \ndepression while being safely detoxed from alcohol in September 2016. At discharge, he \nwas diagnosed, in part, with unspecified anxiety disorder and unspecified depressive \ndisorder. Applicant expressed some suicidal thoughts when intoxicated in October 2016, \nand during his inpatient detoxification in mid-October, he was diagnosed, in part, with \ndepressive disorder, unspecified. He was prescribed an anti-depressant at discharge. Six \ndays later, he was brought to his hospital emergency department after he had expressed \nfear that he might kill himself, although he was considered safe for discharge the next day \nfollowing a mental-health assessment. \n \n \nDuring IOP counseling in November 2016, Applicant exhibited heightened anxiety \nbecause of tight finances. When discharged from the IOP on November 23, 2016, he was \ndiagnosed, in part, with unspecified anxiety disorder and unspecified disorder (provisional), \nwhich suggests that clinicians were not certain whether he met the diagnostic criteria for \nthe depressive disorder. Applicant denied any significant symptoms of anxiety or \ndepression during an intake evaluation for addictions counseling in December 2016. \nFollowing his relapse into drinking in June 2017, Applicant received inpatient treatment for, \nin part, diagnosed major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation. \n \n \nDespite a history of mental-health concerns, the psychological conditions \ndisqualifying conditions have minimal applicability. Applicant\u2019s expressed suicidal ideation \nis not sufficient to trigger AG \u00b6 28(a), given he denies that he had any intention to kill \nhimself; he was drunk when he expressed suicidal ideation; and he took no action to harm \nhimself.  AG \u00b6 28(a) provides: \n \n\n21 \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behavior. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 28(b), \u201can opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness,\u201d Applicant believes his depression was a product of his heavy drinking. \nApplicant exhibited no overt signs of depression, anxiety, or other mental health condition \nduring his October 2017 evaluation. The psychologist diagnosed him with a history of \nadjustment disorder with depressed mood, but also opined that Applicant\u2019s depressive \nsymptoms and anxiety were only present in the context of his excessive alcohol use and/or \nin the face of significant life stressors. The psychologist did not find that Applicant\u2019s \ndepression was currently problematic with regard to causing impaired judgment, reliability, \nor trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(c), \u201cvoluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization,\u201d has some applicability \nbecause Applicant\u2019s mental health was of concern during his inpatient treatments in \nOctober 2016, November 2016, and July 2017. Even so, his inpatient treatments and \ncounseling programs were primary for alcohol detoxification and not for psychological \nreasons. To the extent that AG \u00b6 28(c) is triggered, three mitigating conditions apply under \nAG \u00b6 29. They are: \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nAvailable medical records and the recent opinion of a duly-qualified psychologist, \nwho is recognized by the DOD to provide sound, professional assessments of mental-\nhealth conditions, substantiate that Applicant\u2019s primary issue has been his alcohol abuse \ndisorder. The psychological conditions are not of current security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n\n22 \n \n2(d).9 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(a), there is \nno evidence that Applicant ever allowed his abuse of alcohol to negatively affect his work \nperformance, although there were times when he could not report to work because of his \ndrinking. \n \nEven so, the Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait \nuntil an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or \nrevoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. \n29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). At some future date, Applicant may be able \nto show reform for a sufficiently sustained period to safely conclude that his maladaptive \nuse of alcohol is safely in the past. For the reasons discussed, it would be premature to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility at this time. \n   \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline I:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline F:  \nWITHDRAWN \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nWithdrawn \n                                                 \n9 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n23 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant incurred \ndelinquent debt during a prolonged separation from his ex-wife, and a period of \nunemployment after he separated from the military. Since returning to work in June \n2017, Applicant has resolved $12,000 in delinquent accounts, establishing a record of \ndebt repayment. Applicant\u2019s access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 20, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement Of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an \nadministrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security clearance.  \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as \namended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, implemented on June 8, 2017.   \n03/27/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on September 26, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, without objection. After the hearing, \nApplicant timely submitted AE F through K, which were also admitted without objection.2 \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 4, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 41, has worked as an operations analyst for a federal contracting \ncompany since June 2017. He previously served in the U.S. Army from May 2002 to \nNovember 2016, achieving the rank of major (O-4). He was initially granted access to \nclassified information in 1996 during his service in the Army Reserve Officer Training \nCorps (ROTC). He completed his most recent security clearance application in May \n2017, disclosing outstanding federal and state income taxes and other delinquent \naccounts. Based on Applicant\u2019s disclosures and information developed during his \nbackground investigation, the SOR alleges that Applicant owes $65,000 in delinquent \ndebt. Most of the alleged debt is for the $26,900 past-due balance on a mortgage \naccount.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in approximately 2008, when he received \norders for his new duty station. His wife wanted to remain in State 1 in the family home \nwith the couple\u2019s two minor children. Applicant agreed and moved to his new duty \nstation unaccompanied. His wife did not work outside the home, so Applicant fully \nsupported the household in addition to paying his separate living expenses. Applicant \nand his wife separated in 2010. They did not have a formal separation agreement, but \nApplicant agreed to continue the support arrangement, which cost him approximately \n$2,000 per month. In addition, he also paid $452 in child support for his daughter from \nanother relationship.4 \n \n \nApplicant maintained this arrangement for eight years. The couple agreed to \ncontinue the support arrangement in their 2016 divorce decree. Applicant struggled \nfinancially and began to accumulate delinquent debt. He incurred a 2012 state income \ntax balance after his tax preparer erroneously applied a tax credit that Applicant was not \nentitled to receive. Although he filed his 2015 federal income returns as required, he \ncould not afford to pay his additional tax obligation. He also began falling behind on the \nmortgage of the family home in early 2016 and ultimately lost the house to foreclosure \nin October 2016. After separating from the Army in November 2016, Applicant was \nunemployed for seven months until he began his current position. While unemployed, \nhe received $116 per week in unemployment compensation.5  \n \n                                                          \n2 HE III. \n \n3 Tr. 17-19; GE 1 \u2013 3. \n \n4 Tr. 17, 20-22, 25, 30. \n \n5 Tr. 22-32, 38; AE H.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nWhen Applicant retuned to work in June 2017, he began earning $70,000 \nannually. He has since earned a raise to $84,000. He began repaying his delinquent \ndebt. To date, he resolved the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($6,619), 1.f ($3,701), \n1.h ($60), 1.j ($37), 1.k ($36), and 1.l ($32). He paid the outstanding state income taxes \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m ($2,300) in October 2017. He claims to have entered into \npayment plans to resolve the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($3,761) and 1.g \n($559) and the federal income taxes alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n ($5,312) since May 2017, \npaying $175 each month. However, he did not provide evidence of a payment history for \nthe accounts. Applicant\u2019s home, which was secured by a loan from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, was sold at a foreclosure sale. He does not know how much the home \nsold for and claims that the VA advised him that he does not owe a deficiency balance \non the loan. The record is unclear about the status of the mortgage loan alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($9,542) and 1.d ($6,351) remain unresolved.6  \n \n \nApplicant lives with his girlfriend and their infant daughter. He pays $1,100 in \nchild support for his two minor children and provides his oldest son approximately $400 \neach month to help with his college expenses.7  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgement, or willingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.8 The SOR \nalleged that Applicant owed approximately $65,000 in delinquent debt. The record \nestablishes that he has a history of not meeting his financial obligations and inability to \ndo so. He also failed to pay his federal and state income taxes as required.9  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by events beyond his control, his \nseparation from his wife between 2009 and their divorce in 2016, and a seven-month \nperiod of unemployment after he separated from the military in November 2016. During \nthat time, Applicant expended approximately $2,500 each month to support his ex-wife \nand their two children, his third child from another relationship, as well as his own living \nexpenses. He acted responsibly under the circumstances by resolving his delinquent \ndebt when he returned to full employment. Since June 2017, he has resolved $12,800 in \ndelinquent accounts. Although Applicant paid five of the six accounts after he received \nthe SOR, this is reasonable given that he returned to work less than six months before \nreceiving the SOR. In addition, the amount of support he provides to his ex-wife and \nchildren decreased substantially, giving him more disposable income to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts.  \n                                                          \n8 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n9 AG \u00b6 19 (a), (c), and (f). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n\u201cAn applicant is not required to be debt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all \ndebts immediately or simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act \nresponsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by concomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a serious intent \nto effectuate the plan.10 Although a number of delinquent accounts remain unresolved, \nApplicant has demonstrated a sufficient record of debt repayment to mitigate the \nconcerns raised by his finances.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has held a security clearance without incident for over 20 years. \nThe purpose of a security clearance case is not aimed at collecting debts. Rather the \npurpose is to make \u201can examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an \naffirmative determination that the personal is an acceptable security risk.\u201d11 Here, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems do not raise any behavior that indicates poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or an unwillingness to follow rules and regulations that may hinder his \nability to properly handle or safeguard classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant a security clearance.

National security eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 11, 2017. On \nApril 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement; Guideline D, Sexual \nMisconduct; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Applicant answered the SOR on June \n15, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n \nI was assigned to the case on October 3, 2018, and on October 18, 2018, I issued \nan order to both parties to produce their documentary evidence by November 2, 2018. \nOn October 23, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 14, 2018. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted, without objection. \nApplicant testified, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D were admitted, without \nobjection. I received the complete transcript (Tr.) on November 26, 2018, and the record \nclosed.  \n\n \n \n2\nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 33 years old, unmarried, and has no children. He received a high \nschool diploma in 2004 in Iraq. From 2005 until October 2009, Applicant worked for the \nU.S. military in Iraq as a security guard and as a local interpreter on U.S. military missions. \nHe immigrated to the United States in November 2009 on a special immigrant visa (SVI), \nand he was naturalized in November 2015. He is attempting to get a job as a linguist for \na defense contractor. This is his first security clearance application. He has worked as a \ntruck driver for his current employer since 2006. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 10, 16-21, 39) \n \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nApplicant disclosed in his 2017 SCA that he used marijuana between August 2012 \nand February 2016. In June 2012, while living in a state in which it was legal to use \nmedical marijuana, Applicant broke his leg. Two months later, he obtained a medical \nmarijuana card and started using marijuana as pain relief for the broken leg. He did not \nrenew the card when it expired in August 2013, but continued to use marijuana once a \nmonth or every other month with friends and by himself for medical and personal reasons. \nIn his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana only three to five times after his \nleg healed. He told the government investigator during his May 1, 2017 interview that he \nused marijuana one to two times a week for three months in 2012 to help him sleep. (GE \n1 at 59; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 22-23, 25-26, 30-33) \n  \nIn 2014, Applicant obtained a commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) from the \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) to be a commercial truck driver. Applicant started \nworking for Company A as a commercial truck driver in August 2014. This company drug \nscreened their drivers and marijuana use was not permitted. Applicant had a pre-\nemployment urinalysis and one random urinalysis before he left Company A in May 2015. \nApplicant continued working as a commercial driver for two other companies. For these \nemployments, he had pre-employment urinalyses tests.  \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant was working as a truck driver for a company that \nprohibited the use of drugs. He acknowledged that he was aware of his employer\u2019s policy \nthat employees remain drug-free, and he was subject to random urinalysis tests. \nHowever, Applicant thought the policy only applied to when he was working, not during \noff hours or \u201cprivate time.\u201d That month, Applicant took a random-work-related urinalysis, \nwhich was positive for marijuana. At the hearing, Applicant testified that the last time he \nused marijuana was approximately one week before this positive urinalysis. (GE 1 at 61; \nTr. 23-27) \n \nLater during his testimony, Applicant claimed the positive urinalysis was the result \nof exposure to second-hand smoke at a concert or from innocent ingestion. (Tr. 24, 26) \nHe also made this claim in his Answer to the SOR and in his May 1, 2017 background \ninterview. He also testified that he did not knowingly use marijuana after he received a \nCDL in 2014, because he knew it was forbidden by the DOT to use drugs and hold a CDL. \n(Answer; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 26-29, 33-35)  \n\n \n \n3\nThe following colloquy occurred during the hearing: \n \nMr. Nagel: And you violated that rule? \n \nApplicant: Well, not \u2013 I didn\u2019t use marijuana on the job. \n \nMr. Nagel: Right. \n \nApplicant: I used it as like, in my time off. But, I didn\u2019t know that it stays in \nthe body for that long. And in that case \u2013 and that won\u2019t actually \u2013 I didn\u2019t \neven use it. I think I had a second-hand smoke. I\u2019m not sure about it, but\u2026. \n(Tr. 24) \n \nAs a result of the positive urinalysis, Applicant was sent to drug treatment, but he \nwas ultimately released by the employer. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE B; Tr. 25, 35) \nAccording to Applicant, February 2016 was the last time he was around people who were \nusing marijuana. (Tr. 23-25, 38) His last drug test was in January 2018, and it was \nnegative. (Tr. 37) \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nIn September 2011 Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with forcible \nrape in the second degree, a felony. He was handcuffed and taken to the police station, \nfingerprinted, and photographed. He spent four days in jail; met the $75,000 bail; and \nthen consulted with an attorney. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the attorney told him \nhe did not need to hire anyone to represent him. He testified that he knew he was \narrested, but he thought he was just accused, not charged, which is why he did not \ndisclose the arrest in his SCA. The case was closed, and the charges were ultimately \ndismissed. (GE 1 at 58-59; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE A; Tr. 44-50)  \n \nIn August 2011 Applicant had sex with a women he met through a dating \napplication. She told the police that their first interaction began as consensual; however, \nshe requested that Applicant wear a condom, he refused her request, their interaction \nthen became non-consensual, and he forcibly had vaginal/penile intercourse with her. \nApplicant told the police interviewer in September 2011 that the woman asked him to use \na condom, and he complied with her request. At the hearing, Applicant claimed he asked \nthe woman for a condom, which was inconsistent with his earlier version of events. (GE \n2 at 7; GE 4; GE 5 at 12; Tr. at 40-45)   \n \nApplicant testified that they had sex one time, and it was consensual. The woman \ntold the police and gave a detailed description of how Applicant raped her a second time, \nin late August 2011. Applicant forced his way into her apartment and then forced himself \non her again. The next day, she reported the rapes to the police. (GE 4; Tr. 45-46) \n \n \nApplicant obtained copies of all of the police paperwork in 2014 before he applied \nfor his U.S. citizenship. In his Answer to the SOR, he denied that this was a felony charge, \n\n \n \n4\nbut the documentary evidence reflects that he was charged with a felony. (Answer; GE 5; \nAE A; Tr. 44, 50-51) \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nDespite obtaining a copy of the arrest record, as stated above, Applicant claimed \nat the hearing and in his Answer that he was unaware that he was charged with felony-\nlevel rape. In his April 2017 SCA, Applicant failed to disclose that he was arrested in \nSeptember 2011, and charged with forcible rape, a felony. He did disclose that he used \nmarijuana between August 2012 and February 2016 due to a broken leg. Applicant \nunderstood that when he signed the SCA, he certified that the information he provided \nwas correct. (Answer; GE 1 at 59-61; Tr. 53)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant claimed he did not know he was actually charged with a \ncrime. When he was questioned as to why he did not list the arrest as required in his \nSCA, he claimed he disclosed the arrest in an earlier SCA. At the hearing, he provided a \nFebruary 28, 2017 \u201creview copy\u201d of an SCA, which was unsigned. In the review copy, \nApplicant disclosed the rape arrest and derogatory gambling information. He did not \ndisclose the gambling information and rape arrest in the April 2017 SCA.1 There is no \nevidence that Applicant provided the review copy SCA to his employer or facility security \nofficer. (GE 1; AE D at 36, 39; Tr. 47-50, 54-63, 69-70) \n \nApplicant also asserted at the hearing that an employee of his sponsor may have \nmodified his SCA before it was submitted to the government. Finally, Applicant admitted \nthat he was concerned that if he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA, it might prohibit him \nfrom being hired as an interpreter. (AE D; Tr. at 54-63, 69-70) \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on May 1, 2017 and by a \nU.S. Army investigator in late May 2017. He disclosed the arrest in both interviews. (GE \n2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 1-2; Tr. 56) During his second interview, Applicant stated that he thought \nhe disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA. (GE 3 at 10; Tr. 55-57, 64) \n \n \nApplicant applied for a security clearance because he loved working with the U.S. \nArmy in Iraq. (Tr. 52, 67) He provided several documents relating to his valued work with \nthe U.S. Army in Iraq. (AE C) \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant disclosed in the February 2017 review copy of a SCA that from November 2015 to present he \nhad incurred $17,000 in gambling losses. \u201cAs of now I have close to 35000 [sic] in debt , [sic] but its [sic] \nnot all because of gambling. I still make payments on time each month , [sic] and I 100% on [sic] time \npayments. But if i [sic] did not gamble , [sic] I could have paid all my debt long time ago. I have take  [sic] \naction to stop gambling such as not keeping cash with me all of the time ,  [sic] and I have told some friends \nabout my gambling problem so they can keep me going on the right path of not gambling. And for now I  do \nnot gamble as much as before ,  [sic] and one of the reasons that I\u2019m seeking overseas job is because I \nwant to stay as far as I can from any gambling.\u201d (AE D at 39) \n\n \n \n5\nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d2 As Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to \u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d3 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d4 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative \njudge applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAdverse clearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d5 Thus, \na decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Security Executive Agent have established for \nissuing national security eligibility. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.6 \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than \na scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d7 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \n                                                          \n2 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n3 Egan at 527. \n \n4 EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \n5 EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n6 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n7 See v. Washington Metro.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe record evidence established the following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 \n25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n8 ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n12 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; See also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n \n7\nThe burden shifted to Appellant to rebut or prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant made inconsistent statements in his SCA, interviews, Answer, and at the \nhearing regarding his history of drug use. He claimed he discontinued using marijuana in \n2014 after he obtained a DOT driver\u2019s license; however, his testimony indicates he \ncontinued to use marijuana during his off time. Additionally, his speculations that the 2016 \npositive urinalysis was the result of innocent ingestion lack credibility. Overall, his claims \nregarding his drug usage are inconsistent, self-serving, and minimize his behavior.  \n \nAppellant\u2019s decision to use illegal drugs, while working for an employer with a zero-\ntolerance policy, cannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern of \nbehavior that indicates his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations. Security \nclearance decisions are not limited to conduct during duty hours; off-duty conduct, \nespecially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for the government \nto question an appellant\u2019s security worthiness.13 Applicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard \nfor the law, regulations, and the fiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered into with his \nformer employer and the DOT. \n \nApplicant asserted at the hearing that he has not been exposed to drugs since \nFebruary 2016. However, he failed to be forthright and consistent throughout the \ninvestigation and at his hearing regarding his drug use. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s assertions \nthat he is drug free afforded little mitigation with respect to his drug use, and he did not \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \n \n                                                          \n13 See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. \n320, 321 n.1 (1989). \n \n\n \n \n8\nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress raises a security concern. These issues, together or \nindividually, may raise questions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \n \nThe record evidence established the following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 \n13: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \n \n \nApplicant was accused of raping a woman in 2011. She went to the police and \nmade a detailed statement describing the two times she claimed he raped her. Although \nthe charges were ultimately dismissed, the woman\u2019s statement raises serious concerns \nof a criminal nature, which reflects upon Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s explanations regarding his behavior are \ninconsistent.   \n \n \nAlthough these allegations stem from incidents that are alleged to have occurred \nover seven years ago, the seriousness of the conduct and Applicant\u2019s inconsistent \ntestimony continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 14 (b) does not apply in this case. \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n\n \n \n9\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of \nproving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative \njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of \nmind at the time of the omission.14 An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate.15  \n  \nGiven Applicant\u2019s age, experience, and professional background and his \nexpressed concern about the negative consequences for potential employment if he \ndisclosed the arrest, Applicant deliberately did not disclose the 2011 arrest in his SCA. \n \n \n                                                          \n14 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). \n \n15 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n\n \n \n10 \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nIn this case, Applicant claimed: he disclosed the 2011 arrest in an earlier version \nof his SCA; he was unaware that he was charged with a crime; he was unaware he was \ncharged with a felony; and the person he submitted that SCA to may have made changes \nto the package. Applicant acknowledged at the hearing that he was aware that when he \nsigned the SCA, he certified that the information in the application was correct. He also \nadmitted that he was concerned that the rape arrest may negatively affect his ability to be \nemployed by the government. Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements regarding why he did \nnot list the 2011 rape arrest in his certified and signed SCA cast doubt on his credibility, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. \n \nAlthough Applicant disclosed the arrest to government investigators in 2017, his \nself-serving and inconsistent statements at the hearing limited any potential mitigation. \nAdditionally, his failure to disclose gambling issues in his SCA, further demonstrate his \ndesire to hide derogatory information from the government. \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleged Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior and drug use as concerns \nunder Guideline E. As explained previously, his explanations and denials were \ninconsistent regarding both of these issues, raising questions regarding his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest, drug use and deliberate choice to keep the government in the \ndark regarding his behavior, raising the concern that he is unreliable and untrustworthy. \nIt also calls into question his judgment and willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. This concern has not been mitigated by the passage of time. Neither of the \nmitigating conditions apply in this case. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n \n \n11 \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns at issue. Overall, the evidence in the case raises serious concerns regarding \nApplicant\u2019s truthfulness, reliability, and trustworthiness.   \n \n \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:    \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b:    \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n\n \n \n12 \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s documentation is insufficient to show that he has returned his \ndelinquent student loans to a current status. He provided no evidence of steps taken to \nresolve the delinquent medical accounts. Overall, the guidelines for financial \nconsideration and personal conduct are unmitigated. Eligibility for security clearance \naccess is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 17, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make \nthe affirmative findings necessary to grant a security clearance. DOD issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 21, 2017, detailing security concerns \nraised by financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n04/02/2019\n\n \n  2 \n \namended (Directive); and the Director of National Intelligence issued Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs). The guidelines are applicable to all individuals who require \ninitial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a \nsensitive position. The AGs were made effective on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on February 21, 2018, and requested a \nhearing. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on September 11, 2018, for a hearing on September 27, 2018. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government\u2019s four exhibits (GE) 1-43 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission (AE) A was entered into evidence on \nOctober 16, 2018, without objection. Based on Department Counsel\u2019s questions \n(transmitted in an email forwarding AE A to me) related to the origin of two large \npayments and what the large payments represent, I emailed Applicant and Department \nCounsel on October 17, 2018, indicating that Applicant would be granted additional time \nuntil November 2, 2018, to supply explanations and/or supporting documentation. \nDOHA received no additional documentation from Applicant. DOHA received the \ntranscript on October 5, 2018. The record closed on November 2, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe first paragraph of the SOR alleges thirteen delinquent debts under the \nfinancial considerations guideline. Those debts, which total $51,311, include eight \nstudent loan accounts and five medical accounts. The second paragraph lists two \nallegations under the personal conduct guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations. \n(Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and single. He has been employed as a service \ntechnician for a defense contractor since February 2015. His job requires him to travel \nto job sites around the world, and erect and start compressors or provide general \nmaintenance to existing units. His employment between 2006 and 2014 was in low-\npaying jobs as a car salesman, a detailer, jobs in fast food restaurants, and a hotel \nbellman. In September 2008, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in business and collision \nrefinishing. Applicant has never held a security clearance. (GE 1 at 5-22, 36-37; Tr. 10) \n \n \nApplicant explained in his May 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterview (PSI) that the reasons for his financial problems were a lack of funds caused \nby low paying jobs, and taking care of his father. As a result, he had trouble paying his \nfinancial obligations. He believed the student loans at SOR 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l \nwere consolidated.1 He surmised that the student loan at SOR 1.m, that had become \ndelinquent in November 2010, had been consolidated and he was trying to settle the \ndebt. Applicant believed that the medical accounts at SOR 1.b through 1.f had been \n                                            \n1 These accounts became delinquent in July 2010. (AE 2 at 6) \n\n \n  3 \n \nsettled. He informed the OPM investigator that he would contact the creditors and pay \nthe accounts. (AE 2 at 15)  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that all the student loan accounts listed in \nthe SOR were opened to finance Applicant\u2019s associate\u2019s degree which he received in \nSeptember 2008. He conceded that the SOR 1.a student loan account was still in \ndefault and that he has to make arrangements to begin paying the account. He had no \ndocuments showing correspondence with the student loan servicer. His only contact \noccurred by telephone. Regarding the student loan accounts at SOR 1.g through 1.l, he \nindicated that the servicer for the accounts informed him that he was actually \nresponsible for 12 loan accounts. Applicant admitted that the student loan account at \nSOR 1.m was in default and he intended to contact the servicer to bring the account \ncurrent. The only documentary evidence that Applicant furnished is AE A, but it is \nimpossible to determine from the exhibit what action Applicant took to return any of the \nstudent loan accounts to a current status. (GE 2 at 5-6, 15; AE A; Tr. 23, 25-26) \n \n \nAccording to Applicant, the five medical accounts at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and \n1.f, resulted from a single trip to a hospital emergency room. He was prescribed \nmedication to alleviate the pain from a toothache until he could see a dentist. Applicant \ncould provide no explanation for why he received five bills for one emergency room visit. \nHe was not certain whether he had medical insurance to cover the emergency room \ntreatment. The Government credit bureau reports reflect that the medical bills were \nincurred on five different occasions between May 2011 and July 2016. (GE 2 at 15-17; \nGE 4 at 2; Tr. 24-25)  \n \n \nApplicant testified at the hearing that he did not contact and negotiate \nsettlements with the listed creditors as he stated to the OPM investigator in May 2017 \nbecause of his work-related travel. He is out of the office three to four days a week. \nThough his employer\u2019s policy is to have employees in the office 50 percent of the time \nand on travel 50 percent of the time, sometimes he is out of the office up 80 percent of \nthe time. (Tr. 26-27) \n \n \nBetween 2013 and 2015, Applicant was taking care of his father who was \nunemployed. Applicant provided money and food to his father during this period. This \nwas one of the reasons his debts became delinquent. His father resumed working in \n2015. (GE 3 6-7; Tr. 28) \n \n \nAnother reason for Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts was his low-paying employment \nbefore he began working at his present employer in February 2015. His monthly take \nhome pay from his much better paying current job is between $2,100 and $2,200 a \nmonth. After he pays his monthly expenses, he has about $400 to $500 a month of \ndiscretionary income left over. He has approximately $1,000 in his savings account. He \nhas never had financial counseling. (Tr. 29-30) \n \n\n \n  4 \n \n \nIn his May 2017 PSI, Applicant indicated that his omission of information from his \ne-QIP (SOR 2.a, 2.b) was inadvertent. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted falsifying \nthe Section 26A question when he answered \u201cno\u201d to being delinquent on any federal \ndebt, deliberately failing to disclose federal student loans at SOR 1.a and 1.g through 1.l \n(SOR 2.a). In his answer to the SOR, he admitted deliberately falsifying Section 26A \nquestion when he answered \u201cno\u201d to having bills turned over to a collection agency in the \npast seven (7) years (SOR 2.b). (GE 3 at 6; answer to SOR) \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant explained the reason for his \u201cno\u201d answer to SOR \n2.a was not inadvertence as he stated in his May 2017 PSI. Rather, he testified, \u201cfrom \nwhat I [was] paying during that time (October 2016), I thought that everything was \nconsolidated, but it was not. So, I answered no because I believed I [was] current at that \ncurrent time.\u201d Applicant had no documents to verify he was making payments in \nOctober 2016 or that his student loans were current. Applicant\u2019s testimonial explanation \nfor his \u201cno\u201d answer to SOR 2.b was based on a credit report he claimed he viewed in \nDecember 2015 showing that he had no collection accounts. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 30-\n31) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibit, AE A, two pages in length, is entitled \u201cpayment \nhistory\u201d generated by the student loan servicer identified in SOR 1.a. The exhibit \ncontains six columns: the first column identifies the date payments were made; the \nsecond column of figures is labeled payment amount; the third column identifies the \nportion of the payment amount that was applied to the principal debt; the fourth column \nidentifies the portion of the payment amount that was applied to interest; the fifth column \nidentifies the payment amount that applied to fees (a notation on the second page \nindicates the United States Government does not assess late or returned payment \nfees); and the sixth column identifies the payment type. The sixth column (payment \ntype) indicates that from January 2013 to June 2013, Applicant apparently paid the \nstudent loan servicer by check on seven occasions. The payment type for the remaining \npayments is labeled \u201cother.\u201d Applicant supplied no explanation for how to define the \n\u201cother\u201d payment type. \n \n \nAE A shows that all payments are below $175 except for a payment of $12,689 \nin September 2015, and a payment a $32,176, the only payment for 2018. Where do \nthese large payments come from and are they payments or loan consolidations? Which \nstudent loan account or accounts in AE A are listed in the SOR? AE A does not provide \nanswers to these two questions. AE A does not indicate whether any of the student loan \naccounts have been placed in forbearance or rehabilitation. Applicant testified that his \n\u201cno\u201d answer to SOR 2.a was based on what he was paying at the time of the October \n2016 e-QIP. A review of the payment dates in 2016 show that he made five $160 \npayments from February through June 2016, but no payments to the servicer from July \n2016 through October 2016. In November 2016, he made a payment of $160, but no \npayment in December 2016. He made only four monthly payments in 2017, two $160 \nmonthly payments and one $320 payment (where he doubled the monthly payment). \nDue to the foregoing unanswered questions about the exhibit and the sporadic record of \n\n \n  5 \n \npayments shown within the exhibit, I can only assign limited weight to AE A. In addition, \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence indicating that he has taken action to \nresolve the listed medical accounts. (Tr. 30-31; AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n\n \n  6 \n \nAG \u00b619 describes conditions that may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b620 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe SOR lists eight delinquent student loan debts and five medical debts. The \ntotal amount of debt is $51,311. The Government credit reports substantiate that the \ndebts became delinquent between July 2010 and December 2016. The large amount of \ndebt accumulated over a six-year period supports the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c).  \n \nWhile AE A shows that Applicant has paid a portion of his delinquent debt \nbetween 2013 and 2018, a substantial but unknown portion of his student loan debt \nremains unpaid. Applicant stated in his May 2017 PSI that he intended to contact the \ncreditors and pay the debts. At the hearing, however, he stated that his work-related \ntravel schedule was hindering his ability to address the delinquent debts. During the \nhearing, he restated his intention to contact the creditors and negotiate payment plans \nor resume payments. Applicant\u2019s failure to show in his post-hearing submission (AE A) \nthat he has a defined plan to repay any of his creditors continues to cast doubt on his \njudgment. AE \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe record indicates that Applicant\u2019s debts started to become delinquent in July \n2010, when he was working at one of his low-paying jobs. In 2013, Applicant began \n\n \n  7 \n \nproviding money and food to his father who had lost his job, resulting in Applicant falling \nbehind in his financial obligations. In 2015, his father resumed working. The low paying \njobs and his father\u2019s two-year period of unemployment warrant some mitigation under \nthe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nHowever, to receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), an applicant must produce \nevidence that shows he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has been \nworking for his current employer since February 2015. When his father returned to work \nin 2015, Applicant no longer had to support him. Assuming that the payment amounts \nposted and corresponding dates in AE A were in fact payments, Applicant made only \nfour payments to the servicer in 2015, only six payments in 2016, only four  payments in \n2017, and only one payment in January 2018, although it is highly unlikely the payment \nwas $32,176 as is posted in AE A. Applicant does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(b) because his evidence fails to show consistent payment documentation on his \nstudent loans since 2013.  \n \n \nApplicant has never had financial counseling. Though AE A reflects that he has \nbeen in contact with the student loan servicer identified at SOR 1.a, there is no \nevidence to support a conclusion that his delinquent student loans and medical \naccounts are under control. With scant documentation of payments or payment plans, I \nam unable to conclude that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to repay his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated or excused by his work-related travel \nschedule or his uncorroborated claims of having the student loan debts consolidated. \nAG\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns related to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 16, the applicable disqualifying conditions are:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n\n \n  8 \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.  \n \n \nConcerning SOR 2.a and 2.b, Applicant denied in his October 2016 e-QIP that he \nhad federal debt and that any of his debts had been turned over to a collection agency \nin the past seven (7) years. Those two negative answers were false. Applicant informed \nthe OPM investigator in May 2017 that his omissions were inadvertent. In his February \n2018 answer to SOR 2.a and 2.b, he admitted both allegations. During the hearing, he \nexplained that he provided a negative answer to SOR 2.a because he thought that SOR \n1.a and 1.g through 1.l student loan accounts were consolidated and current. He \nprovided no evidence to support that claim. He defended his negative response to SOR \n2.b by claiming that his review of a December 2015 credit report showed no collection \naccounts. That claim is not credible as the Government credit reports show that 11 of \nthe 13 accounts listed in the SOR had become delinquent by December 2015. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s inconsistent explanations for his negative responses, and the \nabsence of supporting documentation for either response, I conclude that Applicant \ndeliberately falsified his October 2016 e-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to the falsification before being \nconfronted with the information that the OPM investigator presented to him in May 2017. \nAt the September 2018 hearing, Applicant advanced two claims for the October 2016 \nomissions that are not credible. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Even though almost three \nyears have passed since the falsifications, Applicant has provided insufficient evidence \nto establish that his conduct is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. AG \u00b617(d) \ndoes not apply because Applicant has not acknowledged that he falsified the \nGovernment security application.  \n \n \n \n\n \n  9 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guidelines for financial considerations \nand personal conduct in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person \nconcept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and single. In September 2008, he earned an \nassociate\u2019s degree in business and collision refinishing. After working several low-\npaying jobs between 2006 and 2014, Applicant began working as a service technician \nfor his current employer in February 2015. From 2013 to 2015, Applicant discovered he \nwas having problems paying his bills because he was providing monetary assistance \nand food to his unemployed father. His father resumed working in 2015.  \n \nIn his October 2016 e-QIP, Applicant deliberately falsified the e-QIP by denying \nhe had federal delinquent debt and that he had debts turned over to collection agencies \nin the last seven years. He stated in his May 2017 PSI that the omissions were \ninadvertent and he intended to contact the creditors and repay the debts. He provided \nsome evidence of occasional payments to a student loan servicer. But, he provided no \nevidence of payments on the student loans since January 2018.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has noted under the financial considerations guideline \nthat an applicant should demonstrate a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of payments that \nshows overall debt reduction. Though Applicant is not required to demonstrate he has \npaid off all debts listed in the SOR, he should show that he has a plan to repay the \ndelinquent debts and has taken consistent steps to implement the plan. See ISCR Case \nNo. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \n  \n \nWhile AE A shows sporadic payments on Applicant\u2019s student loans between \n2013 and January 2018, the exhibit provides no information showing to which listed \nstudent loan debts the payments apply. The exhibit does not show whether any of the \nstudent loan debts have been returned to a current status or placed in forbearance or \nrehabilitation. The record contains no evidence that Applicant has taken any action to \n\n \n  10 \n \npay off the medical accounts, even though he has discretionary income of $400 to $500 \nevery month. Judging by the totality of the evidence, Applicant has not overcome the \nsecurity concerns based on the guidelines for financial considerations and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His request for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance is granted. \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on March 20, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On December 15, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \n\n \n2 \n \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 30, 2017, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on March 26, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 28, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 5, \n2018, scheduling the hearing for May 22, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Government also submitted Government Exhibit 4 for \nAdministrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant \nExhibits A through I, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 7, 2018. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of Iraq (Iraq). Department Counsel provided an eight-page \nsummary of the facts, supported by eight Government documents pertaining to Iraq, \nidentified as Government Exhibit 4. The documents provide elaboration and context for \nthe summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. 11.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old, divorced, and has three children. He is applying for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment \nwith a defense contractor as a linguist.  \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq in 1982. Beginning in 2006, after the invasion of Iraq, \nApplicant worked with the Multi-National Force in Iraq as a linguist. He worked with \nvarious American units in Iraq until 2010. During that time he experienced combat. \n(Applicant Exhibits B, C, and D; Tr. 17-18, 20, 39-40.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to the United States under a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) \nin 2010. He was granted this status under a program that allowed a small number of \ntranslators, who had worked with the U.S. military in Iraq, and met certain requirements, \nto immigrate to the United States. Two requirements of the program are, \u201cThe individual \nhas provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government,\u201d and \u201cThe \nindividual . . . has experienced or is experiencing an ongoing serious threat as a \nconsequence of the employment by or on behalf of the United States Government.\u201d \nApplicant received a credible threat in 2008, which was documented by an American \nArmy unit commander. (Applicant Exhibits B and F; Tr. 19-20, 41.)1 \n \n \nAfter immigrating to the United States in 2010, Applicant worked in private \nindustry outside the defense field. He also attended college. He started working for a \ndefense contractor in 2017, and is currently stationed in Jordan as a linguist. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant Exhibits A and C; Tr. 20-21, 24, 35.) \n \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized American citizen on October 23, 2015. Applicant \nrenounced his Iraqi citizenship when he became an American citizen. He has no Iraqi \nidentification of any type. Applicant has no financial contacts with Iraq. His savings are \nin the United States. (Applicant Exhibits G and H; Tr. 33-35.) \n \n \nApplicant married his wife in 2006, and they were divorced in 2017. They had \none child in Iraq, and the other two children were born in the United States. Applicant\u2019s \nwife and children continue to reside in the United States. As far as Applicant knows, his \nwife has no plans to move back to Iraq. Applicant would not allow his children to leave \nthe United States. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 8 and 17; Tr. 24-26, 44-47.) \n \n \nApplicant has had no contact with his ex-wife\u2019s family since their divorce two \nyears ago. During their marriage Applicant\u2019s contact with his in-laws was minimal. (Tr. \n23-26.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother now lives in the United States, as \ndoes his younger brother. He has two older brothers. None of his relatives have \nknowledge of Applicant\u2019s job, or the fact that he is applying for a security clearance. \n(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 18; Tr. 31-33.) \n \n \nAs stated, Applicant has two older brothers that continue to reside in Iraq. He has \nrecently had contact with them once or twice a year. Neither of his brothers have any \nrelation to the Iraqi government. (Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 21-23, 41-42.) \n \n \nApplicant has two uncles, one from each side of his family, who continue to \nreside in Iraq. One of these uncles is a retired senior officer in the Iraqi military. \nApplicant last had contact with this uncle 10 to 15 years ago, before he began work as a \nlinguist. The other uncle was at one time an advisor to the Iraqi government. Once \nagain, Applicant\u2019s last contact with this person was 10 to 15 years ago. Applicant is not \n                                                          \n1 See Department of State, Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) for Iraqi and Afghan Translators/Interpreters, \nhttps://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/siv-iraqi-afghan-translators-interpreters.html \n(accessed May 21, 2019). \n\n \n4 \n \nsure of their current positions, since he has had no relationship with either of them for \nmany years. (Tr. 27-31, 43-44.) \n \n \nApplicant \nfilled \nout \na \ncounterintelligence-focused \nsecurity \nscreening \nquestionnaire in 2017. (Government Exhibit 2.) He was also interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management in 2017. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nThe information provided by Applicant during these occasions was consistent with his \ntestimony during the hearing. \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant is proud to be an American citizen, and to have assisted the U.S. \nmilitary in Iraq. He feels no sense of loyalty to Iraq, stating, \u201cAll I know now is my loyalty \nto the United States.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit I; Tr. 36-38.) \n \n \nApplicant is a highly respected and successful linguist. This is shown by letters of \nappreciation and certificates of achievement presented to him with regard to his work in \nIraq in the period from 2006 through 2010. Applicant\u2019s work during that time is \ndescribed by one officer as participation in \u201cneighborhood clearances, as well as \ncountless combat patrols in a variety of densely populated neighborhoods in Baghdad.\u201d \nThe officer goes to state that Applicant was \u201calways prepared to perform his duties \ndespite enemy contact on several occasions.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits B and C.)  \n \n \nApplicant continued to do outstanding work in his current assignment in Jordan. \nThis is attested to by the letter of recommendation from the commander of the unit he \nsupported. (Applicant Exhibit A.) \n \n \nApplicant is very aware of his responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance, \nparticularly if advances are made toward him or his relatives. (Tr. 25-26.) \n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Government Exhibit 6: \nAttachments.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n\n \n5 \n \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant has two brothers and two uncles who live in Iraq. Several family \nmembers of his ex-wife also reside in Iraq. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nIraq has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate openly and \ncontrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country \nhave the potential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a).2 \n \n                                                          \n2 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his family members who live in Iraq. In \naddition, he has no contact with the family members of his ex-wife who reside in Iraq. \nHe is a proud American citizen, and he feels he has succeeded in this country on his \nown, without help from anyone. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to rebuff any attempts by foreign actors to influence him. AG \u00b6 8(e) \napplies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nApplicant served in Iraq without any indication that he had breached security \npolicies or procedures. There is considerable evidence that he acted courageously in a \nparticularly difficult and dangerous job. While that fact is not normally a factor in granting \na clearance, the Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. \n14, 2006) the following: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures significant probative value \nfor purposes of refuting, mitigating or extenuating security concerns raised \nby the applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. \nSee e.g. ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR \nCase No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-\n10955 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an \nexception to that general rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant \nhas established by credible, independent evidence that his compliance \nwith security procedures and regulations occurred in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the Applicant had made a \nsignificant impact to the national security. See e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-\n12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances \ncan give credibility to an applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to \nrecognize, resist and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or \nexploitation. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s two uncles held senior \npositions with various governmental entities in Iraq several years ago. In this particular \ncase, I find that Applicant has mitigated the security significance arising from their \npresence for the following reasons. Applicant has been subject to considerable \nscreening for his various jobs, as well as his entry into the United States under the SIV \nprogram. He consistently has identified his uncles and their jobs. He was admitted to \nthe United States under the SIV program, which had strict rules. The mitigating \nevidence makes clear that Applicant behaved courageously while helping the coalition \nforces in Iraq in a substantial way. Applicant has completely mitigated the security \nsignificance of the presence of his relations in Iraq. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq. From 2006 through 2010 he worked \nsuccessfully for coalition forces in Iraq under frequently dangerous conditions. He has \nsuccessfully worked as a linguist supporting American forces and interests in Jordan \nsince 2017. Based on his work, Applicant received a Special Immigrant Visa. Applicant \nhas shown himself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the \ndefense industry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States due to his sense of loyalty to the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Material, intentional false statement, deception, or fraud in \nconnection with federal or contract employment concerns are not mitigated because \nApplicant\u2019s intentional false statements pose an unacceptable risk to people, property, \nor information systems. Common access card (CAC) credentialing eligibility is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 25, 2017, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive \nPositions (SF 85). (Government Exhibit 1) On January 19, 2018, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing concerns \nabout his eligibility for a CAC. The DOD found that granting Applicant CAC eligibility \nposed an unacceptable risk. The action was taken in accordance with Homeland \nSecurity Presidential Directive 12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for \nFederal Employees and Contractors (August 27, 2004), and was based on the \nAdjudicative Standards found in DOD Instruction 5200.46, DOD Investigative and \nAdjudicative Guidance for Issuing the Common Access Card (September 9, 2014) \n(DODI 5200.46) and the procedures set out in Enclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive). The SOR alleges eligibility concerns for \u201cmisconduct or negligence \n01/25/2019\n\n \n2 \nin employment,\u201d and \u201cmaterial, intentional false statement, deception, or fraud in \nconnection with federal or contract employment\u201d in DODI 5200.46, Appendix (App.) 2 to \nEncl. 4, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards (SAS) \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 3.    \n \nOn February 16, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR. Department Counsel was \nready to proceed on April 23, 2018. The case was forwarded to the hearing office and \nassigned to me on April 26, 2018. On May 23, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing for July 14, \n2018. The hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel offered five documents \nand Applicant offered one exhibit. (Transcript (Tr.) 14, 16; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-5; \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A) Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s documents; \nhowever, he noted that he objected to some of the information in the documents his \nformer employer provided. (Tr. 14) All proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Tr. 15-17) Applicant made a statement on his own behalf. The transcript was received \non June 25, 2018. No post-hearing documents were received. \n \nOn September 6, 2018, I issued a decision indicating: \n \nMisconduct or negligence in employment concerns are mitigated because \nApplicant\u2019s rule violations did not pose an unacceptable risk to people, \nproperty, or information systems. Material, intentional false statement, \ndeception, or fraud in connection with federal or contract employment \nconcerns are not mitigated. Common access card (CAC) credentialing \neligibility is denied. \n \nDecision at 1; see also id. at 3-7 (discussing \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d). That decision also \nmentioned that CAC eligibility included a requirement for CAC access to be \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d and stated that CAC procedures were designed to \nensure \u201cthe protection of national security.\u201d Decision at 1, 3, 4, 7.     \n \n \nOn January 10, 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case because of \nthe language concerning \u201cnational interest\u201d and \u201cnational security,\u201d indicated application \nof the wrong standard. CAC Case No. 17-04072 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2019). To \nalleviate the Appeal Board\u2019s concerns, all references to the words \u201cnational interest\u201d and \n\u201cnational security\u201d have been expunged, and the record evidence has been reassessed \nbased solely on the standard of whether Applicant\u2019s proven conduct posed an \nunacceptable risk to people, property, or information systems.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a. He also provided \nextenuating and mitigating information. His SOR admissions are incorporated in the \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old controls technician employed at a DOD hospital for the \nprevious six months. (Tr. 7) He seeks continued CAC eligibility as a condition of his \nemployment. (Tr. 38) In 2003, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) In 2004, he \n\n \n3 \nmarried, and in 2007, he divorced. (Tr. 6) In 2014, he married. (Tr. 6) His children are \nages 13 and 16. (Tr. 7) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 7; GE 1) There is no \nevidence of security violations, felony convictions, or illegal drug abuse. \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s employer, E, authorized him to use E\u2019s truck for business \npurposes. (Tr. 18) E authorized him to use the truck to drive from home to construction \nwork sites. (Tr. 19) Applicant said a Global Positioning System (GPS) in E\u2019s truck that \nApplicant was assigned incorrectly indicated the truck was being used at 1:00 am. (Tr. \n20) E also accused Applicant of using E\u2019s truck at a place and time when E did not have \nan active construction site. (Tr. 21) Applicant denied driving E\u2019s truck on the weekend \nand at 1:00 am. (Tr. 20, 26) On December 16, 2016, Applicant ended his employment \nwith  E. (Tr. 18) Applicant said he quit because he was not going to be allowed to drive \nE\u2019s truck from home to work, and he was unhappy about the way E was conducting \noperations. (Tr. 27, 30) He contended that he left employment with E voluntarily. (Tr. 30) \nHe did not provide two weeks of notice before leaving employment with E. (Tr. 30) \n \n \nIn response to a DOD request for information, E said Applicant was \u201cfired for \nwork-related misconduct,\u201d including \u201cfalsifying company documents and misuse of \ncompany credit cards.\u201d (Tr. 23-24; GE 3) In response to a state request for information, \nE said Applicant was \u201c[f]ired for work-related misconduct\u201d and explained that he \n\u201cfalsif[ied] company documents and misuse[d] company credit cards.\u201d (GE 5) According \nto a state document, Applicant told the state in his request for unemployment benefits \nthat he was \u201cfired\u201d and \u201cI was terminated for taking my work truck home.\u201d (GE 4)  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he was supposed to use the company credit card \nfor ice, water, and fuel. (Tr. 24) Applicant asserted the credit card was misused by \nsomeone other than himself or maybe the credit card account was \u201chacked.\u201d (Tr. 24) He \nsaid someone improperly charged about $80 at a grocery store on his assigned credit \ncard. (Tr. 35-36) He denied that he falsified any company documents. (Tr. 25)   \n \n \nApplicant received unemployment benefits from the state for about three weeks \nafter leaving his employment from E. (Tr. 29) In order to receive unemployment benefits \nfrom the state, he told the state that he was terminated for taking his truck home. (Tr. \n33) He denied that he lied to the state to get money, and he said the truth was he and E \n\u201cjust parted ways.\u201d (Tr. 33-34) He explained that he did not really lie to the state \nbecause E said he was fired, and he said, \u201c[b]asically, I guess, I was terminated, but I \nleft, because I never went back.\u201d (Tr. 34-35)  \n \nOn September 13, 2017, Applicant completed and signed an OF 306. (GE 2) He \nanswered, \u201cno\u201d to question 12, which asked, \u201cDuring the last 5 years, have you been \nfired from any job for any reason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, \ndid you leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems, . . . ?\u201d    \n \nApplicant said that at the time he completed his September 13, 2017 OF 306 he \ndid not fully read question 12. (Tr. 36-37) At his hearing, he was asked to explain the \ninconsistency between his statement to the state that he was fired and his statement to \nthe federal government on his OF 306 that he was not fired. He explained that his \n\n \n4 \nstatement to the state related to his desire for unemployment benefits. The error on his \nOF 306 was because he filled out his OF 306 quickly, and \u201che was trying to get back to \nwork.\u201d (Tr. 37)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nconcerns, standards, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating circumstances are listed in \nthe Instruction, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative Standards (BAS), and \nAppendix 2, SAS. The overriding factor for CAC eligibility decisions is \u201cunacceptable \nrisk,\u201d which is defined as follows: \n \nA threat to the life, safety, or health of employees, contractors, vendors, or \nvisitors; to the U.S. Government physical assets or information systems; to \npersonal property; to records, including classified, privileged, proprietary, \nfinancial, and medical records, or to the privacy rights established by The \nPrivacy Act of 1974, as amended, or other law that is deemed \nunacceptable when making risk management determinations. \n \n(Instruction, Glossary, Part II at 28.) \n \nThe objective of the CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. A CAC will not be issued if there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. Each case must be \njudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and \napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (Instruction, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1.b.)  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n\n \n5 \nAnalysis \n \nMisconduct or Negligence in Employment \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 1 describes the concern: \n \n1. A CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s misconduct or negligence in \nemployment, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \na. An individual\u2019s employment misconduct or negligence may put people, \nproperty, or information systems at risk. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS \u00b6 1.b. indicates a condition that may be \ndisqualifying in this case is \u201c(2) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations in the \nworkplace which put people, property or information at risk.\u201d \n \n \nThe record does not establish SAS \u00b6 1.b(2). The SOR alleges, and the record \nestablishes, that Applicant was terminated from his employment at E because he \ncommitted work-related misconduct, including falsifying company documents and \nmisuse of company credit cards. This conduct showed poor judgment and incorporated \ndeception and dishonesty. An employee who uses dishonesty in the workplace in \nconnection with employer documents and credit cards does not, without more evidence, \npose an unacceptable risk to people, property, or information systems. The scope of his \ndishonesty and magnitude of his misuse of the truck and credit card were not \nestablished because his employer did not provide specific information about what \nApplicant did to merit termination. See CAC Case No. 15-02333 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov. \n16, 2016) (discussing CAC issues and focusing on causing risk to people, property, or \ninformation systems).  Misconduct or negligence in employment concerns are refuted. \n \nMaterial, Intentional False Statement, Deception, or Fraud in Connection with \nFederal or Contract Employment \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS, \u00b6 3 articulates the CAC concern: \n \n3. A CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s material, intentional false statement, \ndeception, or fraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \na. The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS, \u00b6 3.b indicates a condition that \u201cmay be \ndisqualifying include[s] material, intentional falsification, deception or fraud related to \n\n \n6 \nanswers or information provided during the employment process for the current or a \nprior federal or contract employment (e.g., on the employment application or other \nemployment, appointment or investigative documents, or during interviews.).\u201d \n \n \nThe evidence establishes DODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS, \u00b6 3.b because \nthe documents showed that after Applicant was terminated from employment with E, he \ntold the state that he was terminated from employment with E. Nevertheless, he denied \nthat he was terminated from employment in the past five years at the time he completed \nhis September 13, 2017 OF 306. \n \nDODI 5200.46, App. 2 to Encl. 4, SAS, \u00b6 3.c describes \u201c[c]ircumstances relevant \nto the determination of whether there is a reasonable basis to believe there is an \nunacceptable risk [including]: (1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, \nwas minor, or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d; \nand \u201c(2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent and was \nfollowed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation.\u201d \n \n \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information on his September 13, 2017 OF \n306 about his employment history when he denied that he had been terminated from \nemployment in the previous five years. This falsification is recent, intentional, and \nserious. He did not take responsibility for his intentional false statement on his OF 306 \nat his hearing. Material, intentional false statement, deception, or fraud in connection \nwith federal or contract employment concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Assessment \n  \n \nDODI 5200.46, Encl. 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, \u00b6 1, Guidance For \nApplying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the following mitigating \nfactors: \n \nAs established in [HSPD-12] credentialing adjudication considers whether \nor not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally controlled \nfacilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination to \nauthorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in [U.S. Office of Personnel Management \nMemorandum, Final Credentialing Standards for Issuing Personal Identity \nVerification Cards Under HSPD-12, July 31, 2008].  \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious the \nconduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient information \nconcerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained to \ndetermine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property, or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural conditions \nmay be relevant to the determination of whether there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions are currently \nremoved or countered (generally considered in cases with relatively minor \nissues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n(a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n \n(b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not just \nalcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be a \nconsideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n  \nApplicant is a 33-year-old controls technician employed at a DOD hospital for the \nprevious six months. In 2003, he graduated from high school. There is no evidence of \nsecurity violations, felony convictions, or illegal drug abuse. \n \n \nOn September 13, 2017, Applicant completed and signed an OF 306. He \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 12, which asked, \u201cDuring the last 5 years, have you been \nfired from any job for any reason, did you quit after being told that you would be fired, \ndid you leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems, . . . ?\u201d  \nApplicant answered, no, despite being fired or terminated from E after an allegation of \nmisconduct.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsification raises serious risk concerns. Applicant cannot be trusted \nto disclose potentially derogatory information. The DOD relies on CAC applicants to \nself-report conduct that poses a risk to people, property, or information systems even \nwhen that disclosure might damage the applicant\u2019s career or economic interests.  \n\n \n8 \n \nI have carefully considered the facts of this case and applied the standards in \nDODI 5200.46. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to fully resolve CAC \neligibility concerns because his submission of an OF 306 containing false information on \nSeptember 13, 2017, is recent, demonstrates a serious lapse in judgment, and was an \nintentional act of deception. Applicant\u2019s request for CAC eligibility is denied.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Encl. 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Misconduct or  \n    Negligence in Employment: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Material, Intentional False \nStatement, Deception, or Fraud in  \nConnection with Federal or Contract  \nEmployment: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I \nconclude that giving Applicant a CAC would pose an unacceptable risk.

CAC \neligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing concerns about her eligibility for a Common \nAccess Card (CAC). The DOD found that granting Applicant CAC eligibility posed an \nunacceptable risk. The action was taken in accordance with Homeland Security \nPresidential Directive 12, Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal \nEmployees and Contractors (August 27, 2004), and was based on the Adjudicative \nStandards found in DoD Instruction 5200.46, DoD Investigative and Adjudicative \nGuidance for Issuing the Common Access Card (September 9, 2014) (Instruction) and \nthe procedures set out in Enclosure 3 of DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive). The SOR alleges eligibility concerns under the Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards (SAS) set out in Enclosure 4, Appendix 2 of the Instruction. The specific \nconcerns were alleged under the standards for Misconduct or Negligence in \n12/21/2018\n\n \n2 \nEmployment (SAS \u00b6 1) and Material, Intentional False Statement, Deception, or Fraud \n(SAS \u00b6 3).  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 24, 2018 (Answer). She denied all \nthe allegations and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2018, and I \nissued an order to both parties to produce their documentary evidence by November 2, \n2018. On October 24, 2018, DOHA notified Applicant and her counsel that the hearing \nwas scheduled for November 15, 2018. I conducted the hearing as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified, and presented Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 3, 2018, and the record closed.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old, single, and has an eleven-year-old daughter. In 2005 \nshe completed a dental assistant program, and since then she has worked as a \nregistered dental assistant. Since January 2018, Applicant has worked at a large \nmilitary installation as an oral surgical assistant. This is her first application for CAC \neligibility, and it is required for her employment. (Tr. 15-17, 32-33)  \n \nIn October 2016, Applicant started working as a licensed dental assistant for a \nprivate dental office. The clinic served underprivileged people in State A, and the state \nreimbursed the owner of the clinic for services it provided. The owner of the clinic was \nnot a dentist. In April 2017, the owner ordered Applicant to take additional x-rays for a \npatient. The supervising dentist told Applicant that additional x-rays were unnecessary \nfor the treatment of the patient. After Applicant refused to take the x-rays, her employer \nused profane language toward her and ordered her to leave the facility. (Tr. at 17-20; \nAnswer; GE 3) \n \nIn April 2017, after Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated, she filed a claim for \nunemployment compensation with State A\u2019s Unemployment Security Department \n(USD). USD interviewed Applicant and her former employer as part of its investigation. \nAlthough her former employer reported that she was fired for insubordination, USD \ndetermined on May 9, 2017, that Applicant \u201cdid not deliberately refuse to follow \nreasonable directions or instructions from [her] employer. [Her] actions were not \nmisconduct.\u201d USD sent this determination to Applicant and her former employer. (Tr. at \n20-22; AE A) Additionally, Applicant filed a whistle-blower complaint with State A\u2019s \nDepartment of Health and Dental Quality Assurance Commission (DQAC) against both \nthe owner of the clinic and his wife, based upon their business practices and how they \nwere billing State A. (Tr. at 26-28, 33-34; AE H) \n \nShortly after her employment was terminated, the supervising dentist Applicant \nworked with at the private clinic wrote a letter of recommendation for her. He found her \nto be \u201chardworking, responsible and very dependable.\u201d He would not hesitate to hire her \nin the future. (AE B) \n\n \n3 \nIn early 2017, prior to leaving the private clinic, Applicant started looking for a \nnew position as a dental assistant. She completed a Standard Form 85 (SF 85) on April \n5, 2017, and listed her employment above. She disclosed that she worked for the \nprivate clinic \u201cfrom 10/2016 to present.\u201d (Tr. 22, 29; AE C) \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP) and a declaration for federal employment (DFE). (Tr. \nat 25-26, 31; GE 1; GE 2) An employee of Applicant\u2019s current company told Applicant to \nuse the information in her SF 85 when she completed the e-QIP. Applicant did not hide \nthe April 2017 termination from her company. (Tr. 24, 34) \n \nIn the DFE, Applicant did not disclose that she was terminated in April 2017 from \nher previous employer. Applicant did disclose other derogatory information, including an \narrest for driving under the influence and terminations from employers in 2014 and \n2015. (Tr. at 31-32; GE 2)  \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant\u2019s former employer completed a governmental \ninvestigative request for employment data and supervisor information (INV FORM 41). \nHe reported that Applicant was fired for unfavorable employment or conduct because \nshe refused to take x-rays for a patient. (GE 3)  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she was not trying to be evasive or \nmisleading when she failed to disclose the April 2017 termination in her August 2017 \nDFE. (Tr. at 32) She believed her former employer was engaging in questionable \nconduct and subjecting underprivileged patients to subpar treatment to save his \nbusiness money. Additionally, she did not believe that her termination was legitimate. \n(Tr. at 26, 34)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted numerous training certificates. In March 2018, the military \ncommand that she supports gave her an award recognizing her performance. \nAdditionally, she submitted nine letters of recommendation from individuals with whom \nshe currently works. These letters were written by civilian and active duty colleagues \nand her current managing supervisor. She is described as hardworking, honest, reliable, \nand professional. (Tr. at 16-; AE E; AE F; AE G) Applicant testified that serving her \nmilitary clients is important to her, and she wants to continue to do her job. (Tr. at 29-30, \n36) \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nconcerns, standards, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating circumstances are listed in \nthe Instruction, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative Standards (BAS), and \nAppendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards (SAS). The overriding factor for CAC \neligibility decisions is \u201cunacceptable risk,\u201d which is defined as follows: \n \n\n \n4 \nA threat to the life, safety, or health of employees, contractors, vendors, or \nvisitors; to the U.S. Government physical assets or information systems; to \npersonal property; to records, including classified, privileged, proprietary, \nfinancial, and medical records, or to the privacy rights established by The \nPrivacy Act of 1974, as amended, or other law that is deemed \nunacceptable when making risk management determinations. \n \n(Instruction, Glossary, Part II at 28.) \n \nThe objective of the CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. A CAC will not be issued if there is a reasonable \nbasis to believe that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. Each case must be \njudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and \napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (Instruction, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1.b.)  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nSAS \u00b6 1, Misconduct or Negligence in Employment: \n \n \nThe concern under this standard is set out in SAS \u00b6 1.a: \u201cA CAC will not be \nissued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to believe, based on the individual\u2019s \nmisconduct or negligence in employment, that issuance of a CAC poses an \nunacceptable risk.\u201d \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable under is SAS \u00b6 \n1.b: \n \n(1) A previous history of intentional wrongdoing on the job, disruptive, \nviolent, or other acts that may pose an unacceptable risk to people, \nproperty, or information systems.  \n \n(2) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations in the workplace which put \npeople, property or information at risk. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nIn this case, Applicant was terminated by her employer after she refused to take \nx-rays of a patient. Her employer owned the dental practice, but was not a dentist; as \nsuch, he was not authorized to give the order. Additionally, State A found that she did \nnot conduct misconduct and awarded her unemployment benefits. Under these \ncircumstances, none of the disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n \nSAS \u00b6 3, Material, Intentional False Statement, Deception, or Fraud \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in SAS \u00b6 3.a: \u201cThe individual\u2019s \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s honesty, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and put people, property, or information systems at risk.\u201d  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is SAS \u00b6 3.b:  \n \n[C]onditions that may be disqualifying include material, intentional \nfalsification, deception or fraud related to answers or information provided \nduring the employment process for the current or a prior federal or \ncontract employment (e.g., on the employment application or other \nemployment, \nappointment \nor \ninvestigative \ndocuments, \nor \nduring \ninterviews). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose the termination was unintentional, it is clear from \nthe record evidence that she did disclose other derogatory information in her DFE and \ne-QIP. The record evidence also demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s former employer was \nquestionable in his business practices. State A found in her favor that she did not \ncommit misconduct in the workplace. Applicant\u2019s former supervising dentist and multiple \ncurrent colleagues wrote glowing letters of recommendation for Applicant. Under these \ncircumstances, the disqualifying condition is not applicable. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nMy formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are: \n \n \nParagraph 1 (Misconduct or Negligence in Employment): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2 (Material, Intentional False Statement, \n \n \nDeception, or Fraud): \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I \nconclude that giving Applicant a CAC is not a risk.

On January 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing concerns for CAC eligibility pursuant \nto Homeland Security Presidential Directive \u2013 12, Policy for Common Identification \nStandard for Federal Employees and Contractors, dated August 27, 2004 (HSPD-12). \nDOD was unable to find that granting Applicant CAC eligibility posed an acceptable risk.  \nThe action is based on the Supplemental Adjudicative Standards found in DOD \nInstruction 5200.46, DOD Investigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the \nCommon Access Card, dated September 9, 2014, and the procedures set out in \nEnclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).

The decision must be arrived at by \napplying the standard that the grant of CAC eligibility does not pose an unacceptable \nrisk2.   \n \nThe objective of CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility.

(DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal or Dishonest Conduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraph 2 articulates the CAC concern: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s criminal or dishonest conduct, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.  \n \n \nDODI Instruction 5200.46, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nlists the following conditions that raise a CAC concern and may be disqualifying: \n \n \n \n2.a \u2013 An individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about his or her reliability or trustworthiness and may \nput people, property, or information systems at risk.  \n \n2.b \u2013 Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include:  \n \n\n \n4 \n(1) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses which put safety \nof people at risk or threaten the protection of property or information \n. . . [.] \n \n(2) Charges or admission of criminal conduct relating to the safety of \npeople and proper protection of property or information systems, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nprosecuted, or convicted.  \n \n \nThe Government established these disqualifying conditions through evidence \npresented with the FORM (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, and GE 5).  An individual\u2019s abuse of \ndrugs may put people, property, or information systems at risk. Although there is no \ndirect evidence that Applicant was using the MJ found in his car, an  inference can be \ndrawn, which was not refuted.  \n \n \nApplicant pled nolo contendere to the criminal charge that he was driving a \nvehicle registered in his name, which was stopped and police found one half ounce to \nfive pounds of MJ in the vehicle. He served the six months of probation and lost his \ndriver\u2019s license for six months. However, he has never refuted the charge that this \nsignificant amount of MJ was his, or denied use or possession of MJ. An inference can  \nbe drawn that he possessed this MJ and intended to use it. The state legislature has \ncodified laws making this criminal conduct potentially dangerous to other motorists and \nthe public. It is also a violation of federal law.1 This criminal offense was committed 18 \nmonths ago. Without a statement of intent to refrain, or other evidence, not enough time \nhas elapsed to conclude that it will not recur.   \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, Paragraph 2.c provides a list of circumstances relevant to the determination \nof whether there is a reasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. In \nparticular, Paragraph 2.c.(1) is potentially applicable: \n \n2.c.(1) \u2013 The behavior happened so long ago, was minor, or happened \nunder  such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. \n \nThe arrest was within the last two years, it might be construed as minor if  \nsome explanation were offered, or an assurance that it won\u2019t happen again. No \nsuch evidence was presented.  \n \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, Paragraph 1, \nGuidance For Applying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the \nfollowing factors to be considered in each case: \n \na. As established in Reference (g), credentialing adjudication considers \nwhether or not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally \ncontrolled facilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination \n                                                          \n1 See 21 U.S. Code \u00a7 841.  \n\n \n5 \nto authorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in Reference (c); and \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious \nthe conduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient \ninformation concerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained \nto determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property, or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural \nconditions may be relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions \nare currently removed or countered (generally considered in cases with \nrelatively minor issues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n   (a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n \n   (b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not \njust alcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be \na consideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n \n To his credit, Applicant disclosed this adverse information on his Declaration for \nFederal Employment, and his SF-85.  However, he has offered no evidence of intent to \nrefrain from possessing or using MJ in the future, or disassociation from drug-using \n\n \n6 \nfriends. He has offered inadequate mitigating evidence. Having carefully considered the \nfacts of this case, I find \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. (1), (2), (3), and (4) of the credentialing standards are \napplicable. The amount of MJ discovered in Applicant\u2019s vehicle by police can be \nconstrued as more than incidental or user amount. The arrest was fairly recent, and \nApplicant was a mature adult when he committed this drug-related offense, which \nsociety has deemed unsafe.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal or Dishonest Conduct:            AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:    \n \n \n \n        Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I \nconclude that granting Applicant CAC eligibility poses an unacceptable risk. CAC \neligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT J. KILMARTIN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \n Given Applicant\u2019s long history of alcohol abuse, his diagnosis with alcohol \ndependence, and his post-diagnosis relapse, it is too soon to conclude he has mitigated \nthe alcohol consumption security concern. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, explaining why it was unable to \nfind it clearly consistent with the national security to grant him security clearance eligibility. \nThe DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn February 27, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of the \nallegations. He requested a decision based on the written record rather than a hearing. On \n02/27/2019\n\n2 \n \nMay 3, 2018, Department Counsel prepared a file of relevant material (FORM). Applicant \nreceived the FORM on June 8, 2018, and was notified that he could file a response, \ntogether with attachments supplementing the information in the FORM, if desired. He did \nnot file a response. The FORM was assigned to me on October 1, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is a 67-year-old, college-educated man with two adult children. He is \ncurrently separated from his wife. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1971 to 1991, retiring \nhonorably. (Item 3 at 10) He has worked for a defense contractor as a senior logistics \nanalyst since 2014. \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication, from \napproximately 1966 until November 2016. (Item 2 at 1) Over the years, his alcohol abuse \nhas led to multiple alcohol-related charges and arrests. Specifically, in 1978, he was \ncharged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). (Item 2 at 1) The disposition of the charge is \nunknown from the record. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with DWI and driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI). (Item 2 at 1) The case was placed on the inactive \ndocket. After the arrest, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol and substance abuse clinic \nwhere he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. (Item 7 at 1-2) In 2004, Applicant was \ncharged with attempting to drive a vehicle while impaired by alcohol. The case was nolle \nprossed. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 5) In September 2012, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith DUI, DUI per se, and DWI. (Item 2 at 1) Applicant was found guilty of the DWI charge, \nand all of the other charges were nolle prossed. He was sentenced to 60 days in jail \n(suspended), two years of probation, and court costs. Also, his driver\u2019s license was \nrestricted to use to and from work for one year. (Item 4 at 4) \n \n \nIn October 2012, Applicant\u2019s attorney referred him to a 28-day inpatient counseling \nprogram. (Item 5 at 6) At or about that time, Applicant began attending Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings. Upon completion of the inpatient program, a substance abuse \ncounselor diagnosed him with alcohol dependence. (Item 6 at 122, 124) Upon his \ndischarge in November 2012, the substance abuse counselor noted that Applicant \u201cdoes \nnot believe he has alcoholism despite the fact of significant negative consequences of his \nuse.\u201d (Item 5) Per the discharge recommendations, Applicant was to abstain from alcohol, \nattend outpatient counseling for relapse prevention, start Antabuse, a medication to control \nthe urge to drink alcohol, and continue attending AA. (Item 2 at 1; Item 5 at 7) The \ncounselor concluded that Applicant\u2019s long-term prognosis was good, so long as he accepts \nthat he can never safely use alcohol. (Item 5 at 9) \n \n \nApplicant attended outpatient treatment from January 2013 to April 2013 on a twice \n- weekly basis. Some time after the end of the treatment program, Applicant resumed his \nalcohol consumption. As of November 2016, he was drinking two to three beers per week. \n(Item 4 at 6) Also at that time, he was no longer attending AA meetings. (Item 4 at 6) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated February 27, 2018, he acknowledged his \npattern of alcohol abuse, and stated that he was no longer drinking alcohol. (Item 2 at 1) \n\n3 \n \nHe did not specify how long he had been free from alcohol. He has resumed AA \nattendance. (Item 2 at 1) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21) Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse \nhas led to multiple charges and arrests, in addition to a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. \nAs recently as November 2016, he was still drinking alcohol, in contravention of a \ncounselor\u2019s recommendation that he abstain. The following disqualifying conditions apply \nunder AG \u00b6 22: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n\n4 \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) \nof alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges his pattern of alcohol abuse. He attends AA regularly, and \nhas completed counseling programs. Conversely, a previous attempt to quit drinking \nalcohol was unsuccessful, as he relapsed after a diagnosis of alcohol dependence in 2012. \nMoreover, although Applicant noted that he is no longer drinking alcohol, the record is \nunclear when this latest attempt at abstinence began. Consequently, given the nature and \nseriousness of Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse, the length of time that he abused alcohol, his \nrelapse, and the fact that he was drinking alcohol at least as recently as November 2016, \nnone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the alcohol \nconsumption security concern.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my disposition of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions. I conclude Applicant has failed to carry the burden. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He worked in that field from May 2016 \nto May 2017, when he began training for his current job. Applicant has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor, as a linguist in Iraq since June 2017.2  \n \n \nApplicant worked for U.S. contractors in Iraq at forward operating military bases \nfrom 2004 to 2010. He lived on base and due to the dangerousness of the missions he \nwas assigned, he rarely went home. He testified that on a daily basis he was involved in \nall types of operations and missions, including combat operations. He was also involved \nin the arrest of terrorists. He estimated that from 2004 to 2010, he participated in 800 to \n1,000 missions \u201coutside the wire,\u201d meaning off-base and was subjected to combat \nsituations with U.S. military forces. He testified that his unit was attacked on numerous \noccasions. One of the times, he was in a Humvee when it hit an improvised explosive \ndevice. He also participated in missions where there were casualties.3   \n \n \nAfter being granted an SIV for his service and immigrating to the United States, \nApplicant worked from approximately 2011 to 2016 as a security officer and also worked \na second job as a translator.4 \n                                                          \n1 Source documents are attached to Hearing Exhibit I. \n \n2 Tr. 18-26; AE F, G, J. \n \n3 Tr. 26-29. \n \n4 Tr. 24-25. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant provided documents to show he renounced his Iraqi citizenship and \nrelinquished his expired Iraqi passport.5 He provided a character letter from a military \nofficer who is an officer-in-charge and with whom he has worked with in Iraq over the past \ntwo years. The officer stated that in the time they have worked together, which was daily \nover the past three months, Applicant has worked on escort missions that required a level \nof discretion. Applicant is described as respectful of privacy, protects information, and \nadheres to rules and restrictions. He has an outstanding work ethic and is considered an \noutstanding citizen. He is punctual and does exactly what he is told to do and promptly \ncompletes the assignment. The officer has great trust and faith in Applicant and his loyalty \nand integrity is beyond reproach.6 \n \n \nApplicant also provided character letters from those whom he served with before \nimmigrating to the United States. They say he served honorably and enabled United \nStates forces to successfully accomplish its missions. He was an integral member of a \nplatoon, allowing it to successfully engage the local populace and members of the Iraqi \ngovernment. He earned the trust of the Iraqi Army and was a vital link for joint American-\nIraqi cooperation. On multiple occasions, his quick actions and understanding of both \nIraqi and American cultures assisted in allowing U.S. forces to gain the respect of the \nlocal populace. He was described as trustworthy and reliable.7  \n \n \nAnother character letter from a military officer that Applicant served with in Iraq \nstated that he was dedicated to his duty and a true professional while working with forces \nin hazardous environments. He aided platoons successfully in their daily combat \nmissions. He was considered honest and hard working. \n \n \nApplicant has no financial interests in Iraq. He and his brother own a house in the \nUnited States, which they purchased in 2017. They both pay the mortgage on the house, \nand when Applicant is in the United States, he lives with his brother and his brother\u2019s \nfamily. He also owns two older model vehicles and a third he owns with his brother. \nApplicant contributes to an Individual Retirement Account. In 2018, he earned \napproximately $73,000 in income. He has approximately $90,000 in a savings account in \nthe United States. He intends to retire in the United States.8 \n \n \nApplicant has three brothers. His brother with whom he purchased a house with, \nimmigrated to the United States in 2011 on an SIV, which he obtained because of his \nservice to the United States. He is a security officer. His brother and his wife are \npermanent residents of the United States and his brother has applied to be a naturalized \ncitizen. He has his interview scheduled in the coming weeks. They have four children.9  \n                                                          \n5 AE A. \n \n6 AE B. \n \n7 AE D. \n \n8 Tr. 59; AE E, H. \n \n9 Tr. 20-21, 68-71. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nOne brother joined the Iraqi Army in the 1990s. He is a citizen and resident of Iraq. \nApplicant stated that after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi security forces were \ndissolved, so his brother was not a part of the army at that time. His brother worked for \nthe United States military before returning to the Iraqi Army in approximately 2006 or \n2007. Applicant does not know what his brother\u2019s military occupation is, but believes it is \nadministrative. He holds the rank of major. The last time Applicant saw this brother was \nin January 2010. His brother is married with two children. Applicant speaks to him about \nonce or twice a year. He last spoke with this brother about three months ago.10 \n \n \nAnother brother of Applicant\u2019s worked as a carpenter for the United States forces \nfrom 2004 to 2007. He travels to the country of Georgia where he works as a property \nmanager of real estate. He also worked in Iraq for the Ministry of Oil and Minerals. He \nhas been on leave from this positon for the past four years because the factory is closed. \nHe receives partial pay while it is closed. Applicant has only visited this brother once in \nperson since 2010. He visited him in Georgia in 2018, because Applicant\u2019s visa expired, \nand Applicant had to leave Iraq. He stayed in Georgia with his brother until his visa was \nrenewed. He has quarterly telephonic contact. He provided this brother some money in \napproximately 2014 or 2015, when his brother was in Georgia.11  \n \nApplicant has six sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Their information \nis as follows:  \n \nSister #1 was born in 1962 and is married with four children. Applicant\u2019s last \ncontact with her was by phone in 2014. Her husband\u2019s occupation is unknown.12  \n \nSister #2 was born in 1964 and is married with children. Applicant does not know \nhow many children. He believes her husband works in construction. His last contact with \nher was in 2009.13  \n \nSister #3 was born in 1966. She is a widow with four children. She is also a teacher \nApplicant has not spoken to her since 2015.14 \n \nSister #4 was born in 1968 and is single. She is a teacher and lives in Iraq with \ntheir two brothers and a sister in the same house. Applicant has not seen her since 2010. \nHe last spoke with her about eight months ago by phone. He does not provide her or any \n                                                          \n \n10 Tr. 29-33, 42-44. \n \n11 Tr. 34-46; GE 3; AE L. \n \n12 Tr. 49-50; GE 3. \n \n13 Tr. 50-51; GE 3. \n \n14 Tr. 55-56; GE 3. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nother siblings financial support, except as noted to above to his one brother. The four \nsiblings in Iraq have applied for immigration visas to the United States.15  \n \nSister #5 was born in 1972 and is a teacher. Applicant spoke her with about ten \nmonths ago. She was not married at the time, but he believes she has subsequently \nmarried. She lives in Iraq with her brothers and sister. Applicant has contact with her once \nor twice a year.16 \n \nSister #6 was born in 1974. She is a teacher, who is married and has no children. \nApplicant does not know her husband\u2019s occupation. He last spoke to her by phone in \n2014.17  \n \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers and two of his sisters moved to another area of Iraq \nbecause it was safer and away from areas that ISIS had infiltrated. They share living \nquarters.18  \n \nApplicant also has a half-sister. She is his mother\u2019s daughter from his mother\u2019s first \nmarriage. She was born in 1955. His last contact with her was in 2010. He does not know \nher husband\u2019s occupation.19  \n \nApplicant testified that he has supported the United States and its military forces \nfor many years. He is loyal to the United States and no other country. He does not intend \nto return to Iraq to live. There is nothing there for him. He said that other than a few phone \ncalls to his family there, his life is in the United States. Although not asked to do so, he \nsaid he is willing to sever all familial ties in Iraq. His current responsibilities in Iraq are to \nescort supply convoys.20  \n \nIRAQ \n \n \nThe United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of \nthe U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is \nextremely limited given the security environment. ISIS controls a significant portion of \nIraq\u2019s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the Iraqi government has little or no ability \nto control and ensure public safety. \n                                                          \n15 Tr. 52, 65-67; GE 3. \n \n16 Tr. 54-55; GE 3. \n \n17 Tr. 53-57; GE 3. \n \n18 Tr. 54-57. \n \n19 Tr. 47-48, 57 58; GE 3. \n \n20 Tr. 65, 71. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such \ngroups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. U.S. \nGovernment and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.  \n \n \nThe U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under \nstrict security guidelines.  \n \n \nThere are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that \nhave weakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights \nprotections. Iraqi security forces and members of the Federal Police have committed \nhuman rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. There are \nalso problems that include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison \nfacilities, arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits \non freedom of expression, freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful \nassembly, and societal abuses of women. ISIS is also responsible for human rights \nabuses. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n7 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  \n \nApplicant has two brothers who are citizens and residents of Iraq. One brother is \nin the Iraqi Army and the other has ties to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and Minerals. He has \nsix sisters and a half-sister who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant has ties of \naffection to them. He has infrequent contact with some of them throughout the year and \nhas not had any contact with others for several years. Applicant\u2019s family residing in Iraq \ncreates a heightened risk and a potential foreign influence concern.  \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq \nbecause of continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. \ncitizens. It also has serious concerns about terrorist activities in Iraq that specifically target \nAmericans. There are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq because of \nterrorists and insurgents. Applicant has supported the U.S. Government through his work \nas a translator and linguist and is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, \ntranslators and advisors supporting U.S. forces, have family living in Iraq. Thousands of \nthe U.S. and coalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets of \nterrorists along with Iraqi civilians who support the Iraq Government and cooperate with \ncoalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person who is a citizen \nand resident of a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline \nB. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, this factor alone is sufficient to \ncreate the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a substantial amount of \ndeath or property damage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States. The relationship of Iraq with the United States, and \nthe situation in Iraq place a significant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationships with his family members living in Iraq do \nnot pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be \n\n \n9 \n \n \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from Iraq seek \nor have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, \nnevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state \nintelligence services, and Iraq has an enormous problem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with relatives living in Iraq create a potential conflict of interest because \nterrorists could place pressure on his family living there in an effort to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Substantial \nevidence was produced of Applicant\u2019s contacts with family in Iraq and has raised the issue \nof potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. Several he has not seen for \nmany years. He has had infrequent visits with others and talks to them infrequently during \nthe year. Applicant\u2019s contact with his family is infrequent, but not casual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does \nnot apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has served in dangerous \nsituations with U.S. forces from 2004 to 2010. For his service, he was granted an SIV. He \nreturned to serve with U.S. military forces in Iraq in 2017. Applicant served in combat \noperations. Applicant became a U.S. citizen, bought a home, and has considerable \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfinancial interests in the United States. He lives with a brother who also served with the \nUnited States forces in Iraq and was granted an SIV.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s years of support to the United States military in Iraq as a linguist, \nincluding the dangers that service entailed, weigh heavily towards mitigating security \nconcerns. Applicant is currently serving as a linguist for supply convoys in support of the \nU.S. Armed Forces. He continues to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. He has \nexpressed his loyalty and commitment to the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand resident of Iraq. Like every other resident of Iraq, any of his relatives who may be \nliving in Iraq are at risk from terrorists. \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s brothers have contacts with government entities in Iraq. One is \nin the Army and another has worked with a ministry department. I have considered these \ncontacts. It is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge investment of manpower \nand money in Iraq, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and objectives in Iraq. \nApplicant and his siblings living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s \npotential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his relatives living \nin Iraq from lawless elements in Iraq.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s possible future connections to his relatives living in Iraq are infrequent \nand less significant than his connections to the United States. His employment in support \nof the U.S. Government, financial interests and bonds to the United States, performance \nas a linguist to U.S. forces, and U.S. citizenship are important factors weighing towards \nmitigation of security concerns. He owns a house in the United States and has significant \nfinancial interests. Based on Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationship and loyalty \nto the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. His connections to the United States taken together are sufficient to fully \novercome and mitigate the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n11 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant serves as a linguist for a federal contractor and has actively supported \nthe U.S. military mission in Iraq for many years. He understands the risks associated with \nhaving family in Iraq. Based on Applicant\u2019s past commitment and service under combat \nand dangerous conditions and his continued loyalty to the United States, he has mitigated \nthe foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 19, 2018. He requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nJune 18, 2018. The case was reassigned to me on January 9, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 28, \n2019, with a hearing date of March 19, 2019. The hearing was postponed at the \nrequest of Applicant\u2019s counsel. DOHA issued another notice of hearing on May 15, \n2019, with a hearing date of June 3, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE) \nI. Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered exhibits (AE) A-E, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE III. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Lebanon.

(\u00b6 2.a) It also alleged that Applicant failed to fully \ndisclose or report his relationship to LC to his wife or to appropriate security officials; \nthat Applicant failed to fully disclose or report that while deployed to Afghanistan he \ntraveled to Lebanon to visit LC; that Applicant failed to disclose his close and \ncontinuing contact with LC on his December 2011 and May 2016 security clearance \n\n \n3 \n \n \napplications (SCA); and that he failed to list his personal foreign travel in his May 2016 \nSCA. (\u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.g)  \n \n \nApplicant first contacted LC in approximately 1989. They met over the Internet \nusing a social media chat site. From 1989 through approximately 2000, Applicant \nmaintained contact with LC on a weekly basis using Internet chat rooms. In January \n2008, Applicant traveled to Lebanon and met LC. Applicant traveled to Lebanon when \nhe was given leave while on deployments. He usually stayed about five days. He made \nadditional trips to Lebanon in September 2008, July 2010, November 2010, and \nSeptember into October 2011. He was in contact with LC on each visit. He took the \ninitiative to contact her when he arrived. In his March 2017 background interview with a \ndefense investigator (PSI), Applicant initially denied having any foreign travel except for \ntrips to Mexico and the Philippines. He only admitted his trips to Lebanon when \nconfronted by the investigator. The investigator had to confront Applicant three times \nwith information about his trips to Lebanon before Applicant admitted all of his trips \nthere. (Tr. 50-51, 91, 99; GE 3 (PSI, pp. 9-10)) \n \n \nApplicant gave conflicting accounts about what he and LC did when they were \ntogether. In his 2017 PSI, he stated that in July 2010 he and LC enjoyed sightseeing \nand going to the beach together. He said they did the same thing when he was there in \nNovember 2010. When Applicant described the activities he did with LC during his \nSeptember to October (five-day) trip to Lebanon, he stated they went sightseeing, \nvisited the beach, and he met LC\u2019s mother at LC\u2019s parents\u2019 residence. During his \nhearing testimony, Applicant claimed he never went sightseeing with LC, nor did he \never go to her home. He claimed the only thing they ever did together was go to the \nbeach. He also claimed that he always stayed at a hotel and that LC never visited the \nhotel. He denied having any sexual or romantic relationship with LC. He maintained \nthat they were just friends. Applicant did not disclose this friendship to his wife or to \nanyone at work. When asked by the investigator if he disclosed this information to his \nwife, he replied, \u201c[if] you are a wife would you want to know about another woman?\u201d \nApplicant elaborated during his testimony about why he did not disclose this \nrelationship to his wife. He stated that because of her Korean background and culture \nshe would not understand the relationship. He claims that he told his wife about the \nrelationship in 2016. His wife took the news hard, but has forgiven him. (Tr. 49, 81, \n101-103; GE 3 (PSI, pp. 9-10)) \n \n \nApplicant also gave conflicting accounts as to when he stopped the relationship \nwith LC. In his March 2017 PSI to the investigator, he stated that he had at least twice \nyearly internet contact with LC from October 2011 to December 2016. In March 2018, \nApplicant responded to interrogatories and stated under oath that his PSI was accurate \nas written and he made no corrections. During his hearing testimony, Applicant claimed \nthat his previous statement about when the relationship ended was inaccurate. He \ntestified that his Internet contact with LC ceased in 2012. He said he did not review his \nstatement in detail before he swore under oath that it was accurate. I do not find \nApplicant credible. (Tr. 70, 74, 91, 104-105; AE 3) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn December 2011, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SCA. In \nSection 19 of this SCA, Applicant was asked if he had close and/or continuing contact \nwith a foreign national, including associates, within the last seven years, with whom he \nwas bound by \u201caffection, influence, common interests, and/or obligations.\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to this question failing to list his contact with LC. In Section 20C of this \nSCA he answered \u201cno\u201d when asked if all of his foreign travel, within the last seven \nyears, was for U.S. Government business. He then listed his foreign travel which \nincluded six trips to Lebanon (1. December 2003 to January 2004 (6-10 days); 2. \nJanuary 2008 (1-5 days); 3. September 2008 (1-5 days); 4. July 2010 (1-5 days); 5. \nNovember 2010 (1-5 days); 6. September to October 2011 (1-5 days)). (GE 2) \n \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SCA. In Section \n19 of this SCA, Applicant was asked if he had close and/or continuing contact with a \nforeign national, including associates, within the last seven years with whom he was \nbound by \u201caffection, influence, common interests, and/or obligations.\u201d Applicant \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to this question failing to list his contact with LC. In Section 20C of this \nSCA he answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if all of his foreign travel, within the last seven \nyears, was for U.S. Government business. He failed to visit his foreign trips to Lebanon \nduring the relevant time. He also failed to list 13 trips to the Philippines within the \nprevious seven years. (Tr. 88-89; GE 1, 3) \n \n \nDuring his PSI, Applicant stated that he failed to list LC as a foreign contact on \nhis 2011 and 2016 SCAs \u201cdue to oversight.\u201d He gave the same explanation for why he \nfailed to list his trips to Lebanon on his 2016 SCA. In his March 2018 answers to \ninterrogatories, Applicant changed his explanation. Concerning failing to list LC as a \nforeign contact, he stated he did so because he was \u201cnot bound to her by affection, \ninfluence, common interests, and/or obligation to her.\u201d He further explained that his \nreason for not listing his foreign travel on his 2016 SCA was because he was \noverworked and procrastinated completing the SCA and therefore relied solely on his \nmemory without having access to his previous SCA to retrieve the information. (GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant testified somewhat consistent with his answers to the interrogatories. \nHe did not list LC on either SCAs because he felt the question did not apply to him \nsince he was not bound to LC by any of the descriptors. Regarding his failure to list his \nforeign personal travel on his 2016 SCA, Applicant testified that in 2011 when he \ncompleted the form he was not under stress from work and had access to his passport \nto accurately complete the 2011 SCA. He claimed that was not the case when he \ncompleted his 2016 SCA. He was under stress from work, did not have access to the \ninformation from his 2011 SCA, and did not have access to his passport. He claims \nthat he made a mistake by not checking the correct box concerning his foreign \npersonal travel, but that he had no intent to deceive with his incorrect answers. On \ncross-examination, he stated that he was not thinking straight when he completed his \n2016 SCA. (Tr. 52-53, 55, 57-65, 91-92, 95, 98-99) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor (W) testified for him and provided a written \nstatement. W testified about the stressful conditions at work during 2016 when \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant was completing his SCA. W stated that he was informed by the security \nmanager that Applicant was not timely completing the SCA and W put pressure on him \nto do so. W recommended that Applicant retain his security clearance. (Tr. 27-32, 38; \nAE C) \n \n \nApplicant also provided statements from another supervisor and two coworkers. \nThey described Applicant as truthful, honest, and forthright. A coworker recommended \nthat he retain his clearance. (AE B, D-E) \n \n \nAside from Applicant\u2019s duty to accurately and truthfully complete any SCA and \nprovide truthful information to defense investigators during his background \ninvestigation, the Government did not produce any evidence that Applicant had a duty \nto disclose his relationship with LC to security officials. The Government also failed to \nproduce evidence that Applicant had a duty to report that he traveled to Lebanon to \nvisit LC while deployed to Afghanistan. The Government also failed to produce \nevidence that Applicant was made aware of such duties, if they existed.    \n \nLebanon \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary democracy in which people have the constitutional \nright to change their government. Due to civil war the exercise of political rights were \nprecluded until 1992. Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire \ncommercial tradition. The economy is service-oriented. The United States enjoys a \nstrong exporter position with Lebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported goods. \nMore than 160 offices representing U.S. businesses operate in Lebanon. Since the \nlifting of passport restrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened \nbranch or regional offices in Lebanon.  \n \n \nThe foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of \nits population, and its reliance on commerce and trade. Its foreign policy is heavily \ninfluenced by neighboring Syria, which has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal \npolicies as well. Lebanon, like most Arab states, does not recognize Israel, with which \nit has been technically at war since Israel\u2019s establishment.  \n \n \nLebanon has had some human-rights problems including the arbitrary arrest and \ndetainment of individuals and instances of arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life, \ntorture, and other abuses.  \n \n \nThe terrorist group Hezbollah is a Lebanese-based radical Shi\u2019a group and is \ndesignated by the United States as a \u201cForeign Terrorist Organization.\u201d The Lebanese \ngovernment recognizes Hezbollah as a \u201clegitimate resistance group\u201d and political party \nand until recently was represented by elected officials in the Lebanese parliament. \nHezbollah also provides support to several Palestinian terrorist organizations and is \nknown to be involved in numerous anti-United States and anti-Israeli terrorist attacks. \nAmericans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and \nto help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity. \nOther terrorist organizations operating in Lebanon include: Al-Nusrah Front (ANF), \nHamas, and Abdullah Azzam Brigades (AAB). The United States provides more than \n$400 million in aid to Lebanon and pledged $1 billion in additional aid. The aid reflects \nthe importance the United States attaches to Lebanon\u2019s development as a unified, \nindependent and sovereign country. \n \n \nU.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that \nimpose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. The U.S. State Department \nissued a travel advisory, updated January 2018, urging U.S. citizens to reconsider or \navoid travel to particular areas in Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and \narmed conflict especially near Lebanon\u2019s borders with Syria and Israel. \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated \nor induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nLC is a citizen and resident of Lebanon. Applicant maintained a secret \nrelationship with her starting in 1989, which he claims ended in either 2012 or 2016. \nApplicant visited LC in Lebanon on at least five occasions while he was deployed. He \nkept this relationship from his wife and coworkers. Lebanon is a country with a \nsignificant terrorist presence, including the group Hezbollah, which has been \ndesignated as a foreign terrorist organization. Lebanon has human-rights issues. \nBecause of Lebanon\u2019s posture in these areas, and Applicant\u2019s connection to LC, there \nexists a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nand coercion. The same situation also creates a potential conflict of interest for \nApplicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.   \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.  \n \n \nBased upon Lebanon\u2019s allowing Hezbollah to operate freely in the country, its \nhuman rights problems, and Applicant\u2019s deception concerning his relationship with LC, \na situation exists where Applicant could be placed in a position to choose between the \ninterests LC in Lebanon and those of the United States. Additionally, LC\u2019s presence in \nLebanon places Applicant in a susceptible position. Applicant claimed he ended the \nrelationship with LC, but I do not find this assertion credible or corroborated. Although \nApplicant has significant ties to the United States, he also engaged in a hidden \nrelationship with a foreign national while deployed to foreign locations. As stated \nabove, the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration and any \ndoubt must be resolved in favor of national security. I am unable to find either of the \nmitigating conditions to be fully applicable. Despite the presence of some mitigation, it \nis insufficient to overcome the significant security concerns that exist.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal \nin that country; and \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s secret relationship with LC, as described above demonstrated poor \njudgment, unreliability, untrustworthiness. This conduct created a vulnerability to \nexploitation and manipulation by an individual of a group. AG \u00b6 16(c) and \u00b6 16(e) apply \nto SOR \u00b6 2.a, and \u00b6 16(e) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n \n \nThe Government failed to establish the necessary duty to report and knowledge \nof any such duty by Applicant. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.d are concluded for the Applicant. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to list LC as a foreign contact on his 2011 and 2016 \nSCAs. Applicant\u2019s claim that he was not bound to LC by any obligation or common \ninterest is not supported by the evidence. The evidence, on the contrary, establishes \nthat Applicant had a long-term relationship with LC. Examples of their common \ninterests included communicating over the Internet for at least 20 years and Applicant \nmaking at least five trips to Lebanon for the express purpose of being with LC each \ntime he went. Additionally, Applicant was not credible concerning the nature of his \nrelationship with LC because his testimony conflicted with his earlier statements about \ntheir association in Lebanon. He hid this relationship from his wife and coworkers and \nhe also hid it from the Government when he failed to disclose it on his SCAs. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.g. \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to list his personal foreign travel on his 2016 SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation about being under stress from work and not having access to \nhis passport and previous SCAs is not credible given his previous experience with \nsecurity clearances, the sheer number of trips he took (12 to the Philippines and 5 to \nLebanon), and the evidence supporting his deceitfulness. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 \n2.f. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 17 and found the following relevant:   \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and   \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to disclose to the defense investigator his trips to Lebanon and \nhis contact with LC until he was confronted with those facts. There is no evidence that \nhe received erroneous advice about his duty to truthfully disclose information on his \nSCA. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s pattern of deceitfulness to his wife, his coworkers, in \ncompleting his SCAs, and in providing information to defense investigators is not \nbehavior that is minor or infrequent. He demonstrated a pattern of behavior of \nuntruthfulness and deceit that casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Even though he claimed to have ended the relationship (without \ncorroboration), his secretive pattern of behavior does not support the notion that such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. If he ended the relationship with LC that action would \nsupport that he reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation. However, that \nevidence is insufficient. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nLebanon allows a designated terrorist organization to operate with its borders \nand has human-rights problems. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship \nwith the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s associates are vulnerable to government coercion. \nApplicant has not overcome the vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and \nduress created by his relationship to LC.  \n \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service, his numerous \ndeployments to hostile areas, both while in the military and as a contractor, and his \ncharacter evidence. On the other hand, I have also considered Applicant\u2019s \ndeceitfulness and multiple false statements on his SCAs and to investigators.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the foreign influence or the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph     1.a: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs   2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs   2.c \u2013 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs   2.e \u2013 2.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 6, 2016. On \nApril 11, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD as of June 8, 2017. \n01/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 9, 2018, and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. On June 19, 2018, Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents \nidentified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant received the FORM on June 28, 2018. She was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 \nand 2) are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 2.a. She provided some explanations and a narrative statement, but she \nprovided no documents with her Answer. Her admissions and other comments are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. She graduated from high school in 2004. Since then, she \nhas worked as a sheet metal worker for a defense contractor at a naval shipyard. She \nhas never married. She has a 17-year-old son. She has never held a clearance before. \n(Item 3) On her May 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed a past-due debt relating to an \nautomobile, and said she was making payments. She did not disclose that she had any \nother financial issues. (Item 3)  \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government first alleged that Applicant failed to timely file \nher state and federal tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) \nThe Government also alleged that she owed about $6,600 in unpaid federal taxes (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c), an undefined amount in past-due state income taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and about \n$28,240 in other delinquent debts, all to private creditors. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \u2013 1.j)  \n \n \nApplicant discussed her delinquent debts in her September 2017 background \ninterview. She also acknowledged that she did not file her state and federal income tax \nreturns on time for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, information she did not disclose on \nher SCA. She acknowledged in her background interview that she decided not to file her \ntax returns because she could not pay what she owed. She intended to save money and \nfile her returns when she could afford to do so. (Item 3 at 22; Item 4 at 9) \n \n \nApplicant authenticated the summary of her background interview in an \ninterrogatory response she submitted to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals in \nMarch 2018. She also reported that she had filed her state and federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, when she filed her 2017 taxes. She did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate her assertion. She acknowledged that she owed about \n$6,600 in past-due federal income taxes. (Item 4 at 2) \n \n \nIn SOR \u00b6 1.d, the Government alleges that Applicant owes an \u201cundetermined \namount\u201d in past-due state income taxes. Applicant denied the allegation in her Answer. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn her Interrogatory Response, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question, \u201cDo you currently \nowe back State taxes?\u201d and there is no other indication in the record that she owes any \npast-due state taxes. (Items 1, 3, 4)  \n \n \nThe remaining SOR allegations concern debts to private creditors. Applicant \nadmitted some and denied others. She provided no supporting documentation with her \nAnswer.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $15,227 charged-off debt. Credit reports from July 2016, November \n2016, and June 2018 reflect that it relates to an automobile account. Applicant was initially \ncurrent on the account but later fell behind on payments, and it is now charged off. (Items \n5, 6, 7) Applicant admitted the debt in her Answer without further comment. She provided \nno updated information on the debt\u2019s current status.  \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.f, a charged-off debt for $188, and said she did not \nrecognize it. The account is listed on Applicant\u2019s credit reports, but they also indicate that \nshe is disputing the debt. (Items 5, 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a $146 debt to an unspecified medical creditor. Applicant denies the \ndebt, saying she does not recognize it and cannot pay it. The debt is listed on Applicant\u2019s \nNovember 2017 credit report, as alleged, but it is not listed on the others. No account \nnumber is provided, and the medical creditor is not named. (Item 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a debt that has been charged off and remains delinquent. No \namount is alleged as being delinquent. The debt is to a jewelry store. Applicant admitted \nthe debt without further details. The debt is listed on the November 2017 and June 2018 \ncredit reports as having been charged off and sold to another creditor. The past-due \namount is listed as $0. (Items 3, 5, 6) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a $12,126 judgment issued against Applicant in November 2010. The \ndebt relates to an automobile. (Item 7 at 2) The debt is not listed on later credit reports. \nApplicant admitted the debt and asserted that she has been making monthly payments \non it. This may be the account listed on her SCA. Applicant provided no corroborating \ndocumentation of any payments made.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a $553 debt to a collection agency. It is listed on Applicant\u2019s July 2016 \ncredit report as having become delinquent a month earlier. (Item 7 at 4) Applicant denied \nthe debt in her Answer, stating that she did not recognize it. She provided no \ndocumentation about the debt\u2019s current status.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nher state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 when she \nsubmitted her SCA in May 2016. The relevant question asked, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, \nhave you failed to file or pay Federal, state or other taxes when required by law or \nordinance?\u201d (Item 3) Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question on her May 2016 SCA. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSince the 2016 tax year was ongoing at that point, Applicant\u2019s 2016 state and federal \nincome tax returns were not due until spring 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 2.a, stating that her omission was not intentional and was \nan \u201chonest mistake,\u201d since she misread the question. She also noted that she disclosed \nher unfiled tax returns during her background interview (which the summary of the \ninterview confirms). (Items 2, 4)  \n \n \nApplicant concluded her Answer by stating that she had financial issues at an early \nage but that the best decision she made is to build a career at the shipyard. She has \nnever been questioned or investigated at work. She takes her job and its responsibilities \nseriously and takes great pride in the important work she does there. (Item 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d2 \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 \nto a security clearance\u201d).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation.3 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and  \n \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges an unspecified state tax debt. No delinquency is either alleged \nor proven, since Applicant denied it, and no state tax debt is established in the record. \n                                                          \n3 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is not established because Applicant denied it, and credit reports note that she \nhas disputed it. SOR \u00b6 1.g, an unspecified medical debt, is not established because \nApplicant denied it, and it is not specifically identified enough to allow her a chance to \neither pay or dispute it. SOR \u00b6 1.h is a charged-off retail debt that Applicant admits. \nHowever, no delinquent amount is either alleged or proven, so it is not established as an \nongoing delinquency. These debts are all found for Applicant. The debts alleged at SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j are established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to them.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she failed to timely file her state and federal income \ntax returns on time for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nShe also has about $6,600 in unresolved past-due federal income tax debt, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. AG \u00b6 19(g) applies to those allegations.  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem, and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nApplicant has two large unpaid debts related to automobiles (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.i). She \nclaimed to be making monthly payments on one of the debts but did not provide \ncorroborating documentation. She also has about $6,600 in past-due federal income tax \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and another debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) that is established by the record. These \ndebts are all ongoing and continue to cast doubt on her current judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant has been gainfully employed at the shipyard for many years. She did not \nestablish that her debts occurred due to conditions beyond her control. She did not \nindicate that she has participated in any credit counseling. She did not establish that she \nhas undertaken good-faith efforts to pay or otherwise resolve her debts in any meaningful \nway. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.j, but it is listed \non her credit report. She did not provide evidence of her efforts to dispute the debt. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply to mitigate the income tax allegations. Applicant failed \nto timely file three years of state and federal income tax returns. She made a decision not \nto file her returns because she could not afford to pay what she owed. She asserted that \nshe belatedly filed the required returns when she filed her 2017 returns, but she provided \nno documentary proof that she did so. Even if she had, the fact that an Applicant belatedly \nfiles income tax returns is not sufficient to mitigate the resulting security concern. \nMoreover, Applicant owes about $6,600 in past-due federal income taxes. She gave no \nindication that she has undertaken any efforts to resolve that debt, or that she is in position \nto do so. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate financial security concerns.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 2016 SCA contained a question calling for disclosure of the fact \nthat she had failed to file her state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 and \n2015. As noted above, the 2016 tax year was ongoing in May 2016, and Applicant\u2019s tax \nreturns for that year were not due until 2017. Thus, as to the 2016 tax year, there was \nnothing to disclose.  \n \nApplicant did have a duty to disclose on her May 2016 SCA that she had failed to \nfile her 2014 and 2015 state and Federal income tax returns as required. She did not do \nso. However, she denied the allegation that her omission was deliberate. She stated in \nher answer that her omission was not intentional and was an \u201chonest mistake,\u201d since she \nmisread the question. As the Government has the burden to establish controverted \nallegations, I cannot conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Further, Applicant \ndisclosed to the interviewing agent that she had failed to file her income tax returns. She \ntherefore made a good-faith effort to reveal the information before being confronted. SOR \n\u00b6 2(a) is resolved for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a determination \non the written record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her credibility \nbased on demeanor.4  \n \n \nApplicant has been gainfully employed with a defense contractor at a naval \nshipyard for about 14 years. She has a number of large delinquent debts that remain \nunresolved. Applicant did not provide any documentation to establish any reasonable \neffort, or reasonable plan, to resolve the debts. Applicant also failed to timely file three \nyears of state and federal income tax returns, and has unresolved federal tax debt. She \nclaimed to have filed the returns at issue, but this, too, is undocumented. She has yet to \nestablish a track record of financial stability and compliance with tax filing and payment \nrequirements. While Guideline E personal conduct security concerns are not established, \nApplicant\u2019s finances and taxes remain a security concern. She has failed to meet her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate financial security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:    \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul 23, 2003).  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel  \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/18/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 21, 2016. On \nApril 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F \nand E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on \nJune 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR through counsel on June 8, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. On August 15, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nwithdrew his representation, noted in Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2, and Applicant proceeded \n\n \n2 \n \npro se. The case was assigned to me on November 14, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on December 20, 2018, and the hearing \nwas convened on January 22, 2019. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were \nadmitted into evidence without objection and an exhibit list marked as HE 1 was attached \nto the record. Applicant testified at the hearing, and Applicant Exhibit (AE) A was admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 31, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old supply engineer for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2007.  Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He is single but has lived \nwith a cohabitant for one year, who contributes to household expenses. He served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps from 2002 to 2007, and in the Marine Corps Reserve from 2008 to \n2009. He was honorably discharged. He currently has a security clearance. \n \nAt hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR to withdraw SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n1.m as duplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. The motion was granted without objection. The \nSOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has 10 delinquent debts totaling over \n$49,000 and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in 2016 that was dismissed in 2017. Under \nGuideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant was charged with Assault by Offensive Contact \nin 2017, has an outstanding arrest warrant, and failed to disclose the arrest to his \nemployer. \n \n \nApplicant had a dispute with his girlfriend in his car while he was driving. His \ngirlfriend had been drinking, and became belligerent. Her brother was following behind. \nApplicant stopped the car, ordered her out, and when she refused, he pulled her out of \nthe car. His girlfriend punched and kicked him, and was picked up by her brother. He \nreturned home and was later mailed a misdemeanor citation and summons. Applicant \nconfused the date of the summons, and appeared a day late to court. When he was told \na warrant was issued for his arrest because he did not appear the day before, he paid \nbail and the court date was reassigned. His interview with a Government investigator was \nscheduled and pending when he received the citation (but not the warrant), and he \nvoluntarily disclosed the incident and citation to the investigator. He believed that his \nnotification to the investigator was sufficient to satisfy the requirement that the \ngovernment be notified of conditions that could affect a security clearance. Additionally, \nhe believed that since it was a contested misdemeanor, his employer did not need to be \ninformed as it could have a negative effect on his employment. Later, the charge was \ndismissed for lack of prosecution, and Applicant was refunded his bail payment. He \neventually reported the matter to his employer. \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in April 2016 after he fell behind on his \nmortgage and other debts. He blamed his own irresponsibility and poor financial decisions \nfor his delinquencies. The Chapter 13 plan was confirmed in September 2016, and the \ncase was dismissed in January 2017 for Applicant\u2019s failure to file his 2016 tax return with \nthe court. During the bankruptcy, Applicant failed to make required mortgage payments \nto stay a foreclosure, and the home was foreclosed. In testimony, he admitted that he lied \n\n \n3 \n \non his home mortgage application in order to qualify for the loan. His credit report shows \nan outstanding balance on the mortgage, and Applicant has not contacted the lender to \ndetermine whether he owes a deficiency balance since the foreclosure. SOR \u00b6 1.a is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a bank debt that has been past due since 2016, and not discharged \nin the bankruptcy. Applicant has not inquired about the debt, and has not taken steps to \nresolve it. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e and 1.g-1.l are additional debts that Applicant has not inquired \nabout and has not resolved. \n \n \n \nWhile in the Marine Corps, Applicant served in Iraq and was awarded two Navy \nand Marine Corps Achievement Medals and a Good Conduct Medal. He was also \nselected as his command\u2019s Marine of the Quarter and Marine of the Year, in 2004. He \ncompleted his employer\u2019s leadership development program, serves as an officer and \nvolunteer in his local veteran\u2019s organization, and volunteers during hurricane relief \noperations. \n \n \nApplicant earns about $80,000 per year, and stated that he lives paycheck-to-\npaycheck. He has a \u201cfew hundred\u201d dollars in his checking account, and no savings. He \nhas a \u00a7 401k retirement account, but he owes about $30,000 for a previous loan from the \naccount. He had credit counseling prior to filing the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and claims \nhe is able to pay his current expenses monthly. He noted in his closing remarks that he \nis able to take care of responsibilities at work, but has had difficulty taking care of his \nfinances. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n4 \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 18 (a), (b), and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances have been neglected for many years, resulting in a failed \nChapter 13 bankruptcy and several unpaid debts. Applicant has not submitted sufficient \nevidence that he is willing or able to address his debts, and his dismissed bankruptcy for \nfailure to file required tax returns shows questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \naddress financial concerns. \n \nApplicant admitted his own lack of financial control, and his continued failure to \naddress debts is troubling. Overall, his behavior raises significant doubts about his \nfinancial management decisions and personal financial responsibility. He has not \nprovided sufficient evidence of his current financial status and ability to meet past-due \nand future financial obligations. I am not convinced Applicant is financially responsible or \nmakes good financial decisions. No mitigation fully applies. \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition are potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may \nnot properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited \nto consideration of: \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant had a duty to report \nthe altercation or citation to his employer, rather he had a duty to report it to the \ngovernment in conjunction with his security clearance eligibility, which is often done \nthrough an employer. In this case, he reported the conduct directly to the government \nduring his interview. Even if he had such an obligation to report the incident to his \nemployer, the failure to do so is mitigated. The personal conduct described in SOR \u00b6 2.a \nis sufficient to implicate AG \u00b6 16 (d)(2). SOR \u00b6 2.b is unfounded. \n \nGuideline E includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \npersonal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and \nfound the following relevant: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n\n \n7 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant was cited for assault by offensive contact, and missed a court date by \none day. When he appeared on the wrong day, he discovered that the court had issued \na warrant for his arrest. He immediately paid the bail and was not arrested. The charge \nwas eventually dismissed for want of prosecution. Applicant disclosed the incident to a \ngovernment investigator. He was not aware that he was required to report it to his \nemployer too, and was more concerned with informing the government investigator during \nthe interview that was scheduled and pending before the incident. Applicant \nacknowledged that he now understands the importance of promptly reporting any criminal \ninvolvement to his employer as the typical method of ensuring that the government is \nproperly notified. The incident was eventually resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor with no \nconviction, and there is no evidence of a continuing pattern of criminal activity. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 \n(a), (c), and (d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, and work and volunteer accomplishments. I find that the \nincident cited under Guideline E is mitigated, and the failure to report it to his employer is \nunfounded. I remain unconvinced of his financial responsibility and ability and willingness \nto meet his financial obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.e; 1.g - 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.m: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

(See Response to SOR \nand attachment.)      \n \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from the Program Manager and the ACT Paint and \nSign Shop Lead, who Applicant has worked with for the past nine years plus, indicate \nthat Applicant has had to deal with the difficulties in life, namely the perils of divorce, \nand tragedies such as the loss of his brother, and his mother, yet his professionalism \nand work product did not waver.  Applicant is said to be a very skilled professional, who \nis an extremely hard worker.  He is described as being reliable and trustworthy and \ndedicated to the mission.  He has excellent work attendance and is considered to be an \nindividual of sound moral character and judgment.  They both recommended him for a \nsecurity clearance.  (Answer to SOR and attachments.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n5 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant became delinquently indebted during his marriage.  After his divorce, \nhe was unable to pay the debts he incurred during the marriage, since his child support \npayments were drastically increased.  To resolve his delinquent debt, he has hired an \nattorney who is filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy relief on his behalf.  Each of the creditors \nlisted in the SOR will be included in the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition.  Under the \ncircumstances, the evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a)  the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n \n6 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has shown a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent marital debt.  He \nis or has filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and the debts listed in the SOR will or have \nbeen discharged.  There is nothing else in the record that leads one to believe that \nApplicant is not forthcoming or that he has been unreasonable and irresponsible.  \nApplicant clearly understands that he must live within his means at all times, and pay \nhis bills in a timely manner.  His has paid off his Federal taxes and is paying his child \nsupport every pay period.  Under the circumstances, he has acted reasonably and \nresponsibly with respect to his debts.  Assuming he has filed for Chapter 7, and his legal \nobligation to pay the debts has been discharged by the court, it is found that his debts \nare now under control.  Furthermore, Applicant has not incurred any new debt since his \nmarriage, as the debts listed in the SOR were incurred during his marriage.  Thus, he \nhas demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  There are clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved.  In the event that Applicant \ndoes not follow through with his plan to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and to have each \nof the debts listed in the SOR discharged that have not been paid, his security \nclearance will be in immediate jeopardy.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is well respected by his colleagues \nsupervisor and management. He has shown good judgment and reliability and \ndemonstrated that he is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.i.  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Between 2012 and 2017, he worked as a non-DOD contractor performing carpentry duties. He also experienced multiple periods of unemployment during this time frame. He has never married. He has one adult child.1 The SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2012-2015 federal and state tax returns.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 19, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 2, 2018. The evidence included \nin the FORM is identified as Items 2-6 (Item 1 includes pleadings and transmittal \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \ninformation). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on July 17, 2018. \nApplicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.

He provided the \nfollowing transcripts for his federal returns: 2015 (return filed October 2017); 2014 \n(return filed September 2017); 2013 (return filed October 2017); and no transcript was \nprovided for 2012.

These debts are unresolved. He did \nnot provide any information about his current financial situation or a budget. There is no \nevidence of financial counseling.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n                                                          \n4 Items 1, 3; AE A. \n \n5 AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has delinquent consumer debts and federal tax debt that remain unpaid \nor unresolved. He also failed to timely file his 2012-2015 federal and state income tax \nreturns as required. I find all the disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. The periodic unemployment Applicant experienced throughout his working career \nare circumstances beyond his control. However, he failed to take responsible actions to \naddress his debts or timely file his federal and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. Applicant failed to provide documentation showing any efforts to pay or settle any \nof the debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. There is no documentary \nevidence showing he made arrangements with the IRS and state tax authorities to \nresolve his tax issues or pay his delinquent consumer debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) partially applies to the federal returns that were filed late.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his civilian employment \nand his periods of unemployment, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving \nhis debts and filing his tax returns. Applicant has not established a track record of \nfinancial stability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance because of his financial \nstatus. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
